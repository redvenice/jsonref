Whether they are wholly invented or rippled glass visions of familiar history, however, her worlds are navigated by characters who stay human to the marrow – flawed, cowardly, doubtful, determined, unprincipled and brave. This remains true of her latest novel, Deeplight.In the island chain of the Myriad, gods once rose from the weird waters of the Undersea, ravaging shipping and coastlines, devouring sailors. Razor-mouthed or glass-tentacled, they were a source of fear and reverence – until one day they turned on one another, and tore each other apart. Now “godware”, the powerful detritus of their corpses, is the basis of a thriving economy for those courageous and foolhardy enough to seek it in the depths.On the island of Lady’s Crave, 14-year-old Hark scrapes a precarious living scavenging godware with Jelt, his unscrupulous best friend. When one of Jelt’s schemes misfires, Hark is left indentured to a scientist, and a new opportunity opens up for him: he might acquire an education, giving him agency, worth and independence. Jelt, though, is unwilling to let him leave, and during another reckless get-rich attempt he almost drowns, prompting Hark to deploy a dangerous artefact to save him, ignorant of what it might unleash.Hardinge’s inimitable prose has the ringing clarity of cut crystal, whether in one-liners (“Hope reared its pitiless head”) or unnerving descriptions (“Talking to her was like accepting an invitation to someone’s house, only to find that the walls are made of teeth and all the doors lead to the moon”). Her layered, intricately textured world, peopled by smugglers, fanatics and priests, is filled with careful and absorbing detail many of the Myriad’s submariners are “sea-kissed”, or deaf, for instance, necessitating a common sign language. The deftly drawn central relationship between Hark and the manipulative Jelt, impossible to refuse or leave behind, is as compelling as the widening, frightening ripple of revealed secrets about the nature of the gods and the reason they died. Like the subject of Ariel’s Song in The Tempest, Deeplight is headily “rich and strange” throughout, preoccupied with transmuted forms, the fearsome fascination of the sea, loyalty warring with self-interest, and the human yen to placate and venerate the monstrous.• Deeplight is published by Macmillan (£12.99).

Find Me is a sequel to Call Me By Your Name, André Aciman’s 2007 novel that became an Oscar-winning film, and it begins in the same way as Linklater’s movie, but rather than the protagonists being a couple of twentysomethings, Samuel and Miranda have a greater disparity between their ages. The former, the father of the young pianist Elio from the earlier novel, is at least 30 years older than the latter.It’s a brave conceit in 2019, when any suggestion of impropriety between an older man and a younger woman is generally given short shrift, but there’s no touching or hand-holding here, no lewd comments or sexual innuendo. Instead, the pair engage in a long and erudite conversation that leads them to spending the day together and waiting no more than a few hours to agree that theirs is the greatest love affair since Orpheus first set eyes on Eurydice.Having read much of Aciman’s work, I find his writing intriguing and maddening in equal parts. While the elegance of his prose and the sophistication of his characters are to be admired, his creations rarely seem human, speaking in a pompous fashion where everyone, regardless of age or circumstance, is intimately familiar with classical music and philosophy. Love lies at the heart of his books, but as a concept rather than a reality. No one in an Aciman novel can ever just go on a few dates and see how things work out. Instead they know from their first interaction that they’re destined to be together, revelling in the authenticity of their affections. Ultimately, it does not make them seem evolved but narcissistic, shallow and a little immature.The same problems weakened his previous novel, Enigma Variations, where the central character Paul fell in love with five different people across the story, declaring each one to be the great love of his life before chucking them in favour of the next. Here, Samuel and Miranda are planning their future together before the guard has even checked their tickets. In fact, within hours of meeting, the pair discuss having children, buy monogrammed mugs, consider getting matching tattoos and she introduces him to her father. I’m as romantic as the next guy but there’s a fine line between passion and recklessness. “Is this going too fast for you?” Miranda asks him, and it’s a fair question. It’s going too fast for me and I’m not even in the relationship.Find Me is structured in three sections, each one shorter than the last. The second concerns the burgeoning relationship between Elio and a much older man, Michel, whom he meets at a concert. The conversations and the romance play out in much the same way as they do between Samuel and Miranda, with a neat line about the ageing lotharios eventually having to compete over who is the younger. Elio and Michel speak for the first time during the concert’s intermission and by the time the musicians have gathered for the second act, they too are besotted, expressing sentiments of love that might sound excessive on a wedding day. Novels don’t have to reflect real life, they can elevate the quotidian into something heightened and beautiful, but if the reader wants to shout, “Oh grow up, you’ve only just met!” at the characters, then something’s gone awry.The final and shortest section features Oliver, the previous great love of Elio’s life, who is now deeply in love with several other people but dreaming that the young pianist’s hands are still tickling his ivories. Fans of Call Me By Your Name will be disappointed to learn that the two lovers never meet in Find Me, but as both are determined to track each other down, one can only assume that a third novel is on the way.It’s annoying to feel such frustration with a writer who is as gifted a stylist as Aciman, and whose work is centred around that most basic of human needs, love. Characters in a novel should never feel like characters in a novel and too often here, they do. This is a shame considering his preoccupations are relatable and his descriptions of Rome and life on the continent are beautifully drawn, as evocative as anything you might find in EM Forster. But honestly, if one of these characters ended up in a train carriage with me and tried to start a conversation, I’d grab my things and go in search of an empty seat.• Find Me is published by Faber (£14.99).

Partly because I arrive in and leave London through Euston station, just over the road, I often stop by if I’m early for a train (this kind of casual visiting is one of the joys of free museums), and so I find myself gazing out of the window at Watford Junction and still thinking about a box of false eyes or an amulet. It’s good to be a little haunted.I’d never noticed the tattoos. There are two of them displayed, part of a collection of more than 300 stored elsewhere. There’s a man’s face and a woman’s head and shoulders, inked on to what at first looks like vellum, with deckle edges like an old book. It is, of course, vellum of a kind: medieval books were written on split, stretched animal skins, and this is human leather. Like many of the objects collected by Henry Wellcome, the provenance of the tattoos is vague. They were bought in Paris in the 1930s from another collector, and probably removed from bodies in the late 19th century, probably in France.Human remains without provenance are worrying to curators. They can’t be returned to anyone, reincorporated into the culture or community from which they came. It’s hard to display them with dignity and compassion when there’s no story to tell, no history to offer context or connection. The tattoos appealed to me as a subject because research for my last novel, Ghost Wall, left me thinking uneasily about skin and leather, marking and preservation, and less nobly because like many of my fortysomething friends, I’d started to wonder if maybe I might like to get a tattoo myself. But when I first saw the two faces, I didn’t think abstractly about the fragile barrier between inside and outside the human body, the container of the self, but about inidual bodies. There were the skins of two people, and also the work of two tattooists, and the faces of the subjects of the tattoos the woman with her complex hairdo, above, and the man in the matelot top. And the work of the people who removed the skin from the bodies and pinned it out and preserved it, and the hands of the dealer who bought it for Henry Wellcome, though probably not the attention of the man himself who, like many Victorian collectors, was more interested in owning than seeing or handling objects of interest. I kept asking the museum’s curator: who were they? Why are they here? Where are all the others? What are you going to do with them?He answered as best he could, and referred me to some excellent research, but the inidual stories are long lost. The tattoos are bits of people drifting in time, present among us at least a century after the rest of the bodies, and the bodies of the subjects and tattooists, turned to dust. They are cut off from their stories, and so the writer’s work is to make new ones for them.‘The more you contemplate the chastity belt the less sense it makes’Imogen Hermes GowarYears ago as a gallery warder at the British Museum I would often choose an object as I patrolled, and extemporise a brief story from it. I used it as a way to gather seeds for new voices, themes, characters and places. Some took, some didn’t one, happily and surprisingly, grew into a novel. In the Wellcome Collection, the 16th century chastity belt was an easy choice for me. What drew me was the suggestion that this was not an “authentic” Crusades-era relic, and in fact such a thing is unlikely to ever have really existed in practical use. The more you contemplate it, the less anatomical sense it makes. Its design speaks to a lack of interest in – or ignorance of – the way women’s bodies really work it eroticises control and restraint in a way that can exist only in fantasy. On the face of it, fakes and curios of this sort exist to bring pieces of the past into the modern world: in fact it’s the opposite, and their purpose is to sneak modernity into the past. They make history what we would wish it to be, retrofitting our own preoccupations and tastes to make them venerable and, therefore, unassailable. This chastity belt does not reflect medieval ideas about women’s sexuality. Only what Victorians wished them to be.‘The scold’s bridle was a tool of shame and disgrace’Oyinkan BraithwaiteThe scold’s bridle is an instrument of punishment, torture and public humiliation, peculiarly created for the purpose of correcting the shrew-like behaviour of women in other words, the perfect gift for a writer who is fascinated with women who misbehave.The bridle is a muzzle-like object placed on a woman’s head with holes for her eyes, nose, a slit for her mouth. It is near impossible to eat with the scold’s bridle on. It is a tool of shame and disgrace used to punish a woman for gossiping or being troublesome, and it would often come with a chain attached, to lead the woman in public, much as you would a beast of burden all in the guise of curing her, teaching her. This one came from a prison in Brussels, and dates from the 14th century. I could not hold it, much less put it on so I circled it, strained my neck to see all its angles behind its glass case. It was how I had imagined it, except it did not have the spike going into the mouth that some models have. I decided to keep that detail, as it was important to my tale. I don’t know how or why the scold’s bridle stopped being used, but in the realm of fiction, my characters could and would overcome it.• Homeless Bodies and Other Stories from the Wellcome Collection is available from 30 October on Audible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3c304eb6db05920f9353f3537ad299bc8cf2b47/0_93_4100_2459/master/4100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32cf0f3b58065c707d5120522f1ed120","title":"island stories by david reynolds review brexit","story":"Dreams of empire, blitz spirit, a country in decline … this crisp and concise book shows that competing visions of the past are driving the Brexit projectFor diehard Brexiters, the most potent image of their project is the “clean break”. It is in itself a rather attractive notion, especially in our culture of personal make-overs and radical transformations. Brexit is the New You. It proposes a Year Zero and an Independence Day – points of origin at which a whole other story of British greatness begins. Like most revolutions, it imagines a sloughing off of history, especially, of course, the history of half a century of deep entanglement with the European Union. It offers a free programme of collective rehab, a political version of the Scientologists’ goal of “going clear”.Yet one of the many incoherences of the Brexit project is that it cannot sustain even this rhetoric of a magical escape from the past. It proposes a giant leap into a glorious future but, as the Anglo-Irish philosopher Johnny Rotten snarled more than 40 years ago, “there is no future in England’s dreaming”. What is to follow from the great rupture has always been fuzzy. There is, instead, an awful lot of past.There is Jacob Rees-Mogg’s ecstatic effusion at the Tory conference in 2017: “We need to be reiterating the benefits of Brexit! ... Oh, this is so important in the history of our country … It’s Waterloo! It’s Crécy! It’s Agincourt! We win all these things!” There is the same genius’s laugh-a-minute literary pageant The Victorians, whose dead white males are paraded as the exemplars and progenitors of the post-Brexit future. There are Boris Johnson’s literary and rhetorical Churchill impersonations. There are the zombie refrains of empire in the dream of Global Britain.Above all, there is the constant harking back to the second world war, to the Dunkirk spirit and the blitz spirit and, more darkly, to a rhetoric (aimed at the infidels) of appeasement, collaboration and, in Johnson’s endlessly repeated term for the Benn act that sought to prevent a no-deal exit, of surrender. In a plaintive appeal to party members last April, the Tories’ great lost leader Matt Hancock (remember him?) agonised that “we have got to sound like we actually like this country. We have got to be patriots of the Britain of now and not the Britain of 1940.” But neither the Britain of now nor the putative future Britain can hold a candle to the imagined flame of past glory.In this mixed-up discourse, the Brexit project can’t decide whether it is a revolution or a restoration. If, like the characters in Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials, it has an animal daemon to represent its true self, is it a beautiful butterfly emerging from the cocoon of European slavery or a homing pigeon returning to the comfortable roost of old England?It wants, perhaps, to be both, to suggest simultaneously that all things will be made new in the buccaneering, disruptive, hyperglobalised capitalism that will be unleashed once freedom is gained and that everything is just going back to the way it was meant to be before the terrible mistake of 1973. In this sense, the contradictory notions of history also expose the much deeper contradiction of Brexit – for most of those who are driving it, it is a radical breach in the British postwar social order for most of those in the back of the bus, it is supposed to be a refurbishment and strengthening of that same social order.Complicating all of this is the way the very potency of the idea of a restoration of the past is itself a restoration of the past. As David Reynolds points out in his concise, elegant and lucid revisiting of key themes in British history in the light of Brexit, Margaret Thatcher, in her very first election campaign, when she was just 24, said: “Britain’s prestige in the eyes of the world has gone down and down … it is our earnest desire to make Great Britain great again.” That was in 1950, just after the triumph of the second world war and before the shock of the Suez crisis. Yet here, in this proto-Trump rhetoric, there is already the notion of intolerable national decline: if British greatness has to be regained, it has by definition been lost.But this inevitable retreat is irrelevant because Britain’s descent from these impossible heights went hand-in-hand with great improvements in the lives of its own inhabitants. Given a choice between continuing to hold India captive and building a National Health Service, there is little doubt that ordinary people in Britain would have chosen the dignity of good healthcare over imperial “greatness”.Reynolds gives a nicely crisp account of all of this but he might have risked a further thought. If it is true that a story of relative decline does not really matter to most people so long as their own circumstances are improving, then perhaps when people’s lives stop improving, as they did as a result of static wages and austerity, they become susceptible to declinism. Their lives, they may come to accept, are not great because Britain is no longer great. This sleight-of-mind is surely one of the central and most effective tactics of Brexit. It suggests that membership of the EU, in which Britain is “reduced” to the normality of being one country among 28, is the real reason why people’s own life chances have been reduced.It is possible to make this false connection because of Reynolds’s second theme, the persistent ambivalence in English politics about whether or not it is possible to stand aloof from continental Europe. It goes back a long way, certainly more than 1,000 years, and even in the postwar era, it has weighed heavily on both main parties. It is good to be reminded by Reynolds that even in the infamous Bruges speech of 1988 that gave its name to the Eurosceptic wing of the Tory party, Thatcher insisted starkly: “Our links to the rest of Europe, the continent of Europe, have been the dominant factor in our history.” (Not, note, empire, industrialism or Protestantism, which she might have chosen.) And equally that it was a Labour leader, Hugh Gaitskell, who insisted in 1962 that “we are not just a part of Europe – at least not yet. We have a different history.” Here we see that the very notion of British history has long been deeply uncertain: is it fundamentally shaped by Europe or is it “different”?One great appeal to difference is the profound exceptionalism that was seemingly endorsed by imperial success, the notion, as the historian and Whig politician Thomas Babington Macaulay put it in 1833 of the British as a “people blessed with far more than an ordinary measure of political liberty and intellectual light”. But the other is the history that the Brexiters have been most anxious to ignore: the complex, fraught and often violent nature of the interrelationships of England, Scotland, Wales and of course Ireland.There is here not history but histories. The “island story” is neither it pertains not to an island but to an archipelago and it contains multiple, shifting and sometimes competing narratives. Reynolds provides a very useful primer on the delusions of an English mentality in which, as John Pocock put it in a ground-breaking essay in 1974, the Welsh, Scots and Irish “appear as peripheral peoples when, and only when, their doings assume the power to disturb the tenor of English politics”.This myopia has been inextricable from the delusion of a “clean break”. The “peripheral peoples” of the Irish borderlands have been the ghosts at the Brexit feast and their insistence on being heard has radically changed the tenor of English politics. Johnson’s deal with Brussels, which essentially jettisons Northern Ireland, can be seen as a last desperate attempt to go clear from history. But even if it succeeds, the Scots, the Welsh and even the English may prove to have historical imperatives of their own that cannot be wished away.• Island Stories by David Reynolds is published by William Collins (£16.99).

Tuesday’s occurred on the first anniversary of the Lion Air flight 610 crash in Indonesia that killed 189 people. In March, after an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crashed, killing 157 people, the 737 Max was grounded worldwide, and Muilenburg pledged such accidents would not happen again.But he was subjected to withering questioning from US politicians from both sides of the political aisle, in the first of several planned hearings and further investigations into Boeing’s conduct over the top-selling jet.Boeing was accused of putting profits over safety and developing a cosy relationship with regulators that permitted the company to rush the 737 Max, Boeing’s most profitable model, into service.“Both of these accidents were entirely avoidable,” the Mississippi senator Roger Wicker, a Republican, said. “We cannot fathom the pain experienced by the families of those 346 souls who were lost.”Last week, an Indonesian report into the Lion Air crash criticized the design of the anti-stall system that left pilots fighting for control, as well as “deficiencies” in the flight crew’s communication and manual control of the aircraft.The Ethiopian Airlines crash led to the grounding of the aircraft. That decision is estimated to have cost Boeing as much as $9bn.At the hearing, the Connecticut Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal sharply accused Boeing of engaging in “a pattern of deliberate concealment”, noting that Boeing’s 1,600-page pilot’s manual mentions the so-called MCAS anti-stall system just once. Blumenthal accused Muilenberg and Boeing of supplying “flying coffins as a result of Boeing deciding to conceal MCAS from pilots”.At issue are recently disclosed internal instant messages that Boeing had not previously handed to committee investigators. The messages, sent by Boeing’s chief test pilot Mark Forkner in 2016, complained of “egregious” erratic behavior in flight simulator tests of the MCAS system, and referred to “Jedi mind tricks” to persuade regulators to approve the plane.Muilenburg claimed he was not fully briefed on the details of the messages until a “couple of weeks ago” despite the company knowing of the exchange before the Ethiopian airlines crash.The Texas Republican senator Ted Cruz called the test pilot’s exchange “shocking” and accused Boeing of withholding knowledge of the systems faults from regulators.Cruz said: “How come your team didn’t come to you with their hair on fire, saying, ‘We’ve got a real problem here’? What does that say about Boeing? Why did you not act before 346 people died?”Lawmakers accused Boeing of selling safety as an “add-on feature”, referring to a warning light that advises pilots of any discrepancy in the aircraft’s pitch, which was sold as an add-on rather than included as standard.“If you want to be the leader in aviation manufacturing you have to be the leader in safety,” offered the Washington senator Maria Cantwell, the committee’s top Democrat.The committee has said it plans to change the program that gave Boeing, rather than regulators, authority to sign off on aspects of the jet.“We don’t ‘sell’ safety, that’s not our business model,” Muilenburg claimed under questioning. “We have learned that we’ve made mistakes, and there are things we can improve. We take responsibility for that, we own that, we’ve made fixes going forward.”As the first Boeing official to testify on Capitol Hill about the crisis engulfing the company, Muilenburg said that since the 737 Max was grounded, the company has conducted extensive testing with updated software.Several other inquiries are also expected to report soon, including an international panel convened by the Federal Aviation Authority, the US regulator, to recommend changes to the way planes are certified. There is also a looming criminal investigation by the US justice department.Asked if Boeing could have done more after the first 737 Max crash, Muilenburg said: “I think about that decision over and over again. If we knew then what we know now we would have made a different decision.”The Democratic Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth, a former military pilot, questioned why Boeing did not disclose more details about anti-stall system’s lack of safeguards.“You have told me half-truths over and over again,” Duckworth said. “You have not told us the whole truth and these families are suffering because of it.”Duckworth said the pilots did not know enough about the anti-stall system. “You set those pilots up for failure,” she said.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/046f1c2f1ae52b20d0d67f91301d5d685e7f605e/0_153_2771_1663/master/2771.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5916e5889453777a236f84a30c4113f8","title":"ms launches buy now pay later service","story":"Retailer hopes to woo younger customers in the run-up to ChristmasMarks \u0026amp Spencer will start offering a “buy now, pay later” service on its website next month as it tries to attract younger customers and boost trade going into the key Christmas period.The retailer has teamed up with Clearpay to offer customers the option of paying for orders of more than £30 in interest-free instalments.The Australian firm and its better known rival Klarna are among a wave of fintech companies being embraced by millennials on tight budgets. Many of M\u0026ampS’s rivals, including H\u0026ampM and Asos, already offer delayed payment services and the struggling business is eager to attract a younger generation of shopper, including families with young children.M\u0026ampS said its customers were increasingly looking for ways to spread the cost, particularly of larger purchases. The Clearpay service enables customers to spread the total over four instalments paid back across six weeks. The maximum spend is £800 and does not require a credit application and customers can manage their payments through a phone app.Unlike traditional high street credit products. these fintech firms typically make money by earning commission on the sales transaction itself rather than charging shoppers interest, although some also offer interest-bearing products. Shoppers using the plans typically spend more, more often, making it an attractive proposition for a retailer such as M\u0026ampS where clothing sales are in decline.More than 4,000 UK retailers, including Asos, JD Sports and Boohoo, work with Klarna which says it is more than 3 million British customers. Clearpay, which only launched in the UK three months ago, says it had gained more than 200,000 active customers in the first 15 weeks of trading.Sue Anderson of the debt charity Stepchange said it was possible that these payment plans could encourage people to spend money they so not have. “The services are presented to consumers as a major convenience and an opportunity to ‘try before you buy’,” she said. “But the knock-on consequence can be that people take on credit when they otherwise wouldn’t have.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbaa9dd6ba21d51965936a3cf172839c667d7ecd/77_138_5190_3115/master/5190.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5d1661420c14ebeb2149384c4a18bea","title":"peugeot owner in merger talks with fiat chrysler","story":"Deal between PSA Group and FCA would create one of world’s biggest carmakersThe French owner of the Peugeot and Vauxhall brands is in talks with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) pursuing a merger that would create one of the world’s biggest carmakers.PSA Group on Wednesday confirmed the existence of the talks, which come months after a failed merger attempt between FCA and PSA’s French rival Renault.FCA has long pursued greater consolidation in the car industry, with leaders of the Italian-American carmaker past and present keen to pool resources. Carmakers across the world are grappling with one of the biggest and most expensive upheavals in the industry’s history as they move away from fossil fuels and towards battery electric vehicles and autonomous technology.In a brief statement, PSA Group said: “PSA Group confirms that discussions are in progress with the aim of creating one of the world’s principal automotive groups.”A deal between PSA and FCA would still face obstacles, however. The talks between FCA and Renault fell through in June, with the carmakers blaming the intervention of the French government, Renault’s largest shareholder.Peugeot’s chief executive, Carlos Tavares, has been open about PSA’s willingness to pursue merger opportunities if they made sense for shareholders. In April, Tavares said he would consider buying Britain’s largest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, but its Indian owner, Tata, said the company was not for sale.Tavares, known for his turnarounds of PSA and the OpelVauxhall business bought from General Motors, would likely apply his “cost discipline” at a combined PSAFCA, according to Brian Studioso, an automotive analyst at Creditsights, a debt ratings agency.A Peugeot-Fiat deal could have an impact on British workers at Vauxhall’s factory in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire.

The company would not confirm how much the new programme would cost, but it is likely to be about £5m a year.As of next year, new parents at Standard Life Aberdeen will be granted 52 weeks leave, 40 of which will be fully paid. Additional paid leave will be offered to parents whose child is born premature. Staff will also have the option of breaking their leave up into three separate periods over two years, and will be able to take advantage of the policy from their first day in the job.Sophie Walker, chief executive of the Young Women’s Trust charity, said: “It’s especially encouraging to see that this is a day one right, as far too many parents are currently missing out on paid parental leave because they haven’t worked at their employer for long enough.“If we’re ever going to close the gender pay gap and enable all parents to thrive in the workplace then it’s time for all employers to get serious about adopting parental leave and family-friendly policies which are fit for purpose.”Smethers said: “The reality is that even a relatively modest additional period of paid leave for dads at work would make a real difference. Families need to be able to make unconstrained choices about who does the caring. For most parents that simply isn’t possible at the moment.”Standard Life Aberdeen’s human resources chief, Rose Thomson, said: “Our new policy represents a potentially life-changing opportunity for new parents, whatever their family circumstances. We know that our people need to balance their work lives with their personal lives and this new policy is one example of the actions we’re taking to help them maintain that.”Aviva: 26 weeks of fully paid leave for both parentsUK civil service: 26 weeks of fully paid maternity leaveEtsy: 26 weeks of fully paid leave for both parentsAccenture: 36 weeks of fully paid maternity leaveTransport for London: 26 weeks of fully paid maternity leave"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1dba709b65207ff8dbba07350973fff3f5bb667/0_115_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1abffd417f49f9a94f909c9d1a96570c","title":"churches in nightclubs and anglican gyms can the c of e win back city dwellers ","story":"With membership in steep decline, the Church of England is ‘planting’ new churches in urban areas in a bid to renew itself“I got out of prison about two-and-a-half years ago,” says James Crystal, 26. “I’d been in for robbery, suffering from PTSD, depression, anxiety … I was sexually abused when I was a bit younger, and it just really sent my life spiralling out of control, to be honest. I used to use drugs and alcohol to suppress the pain. That got me into a lot of trouble.”Today, Crystal is sober and well dressed. He wears fashionable glasses and his hair is neatly combed. He is studying business management, with a plan already to sell a range of biodegradable products. To cap it all, it is a Tuesday evening and he is in church – Gas Street church in Birmingham – where Crystal first decided he would dedicate his life to Jesus. “It was in that seat, there,” he says, pointing.Tuesday means student night at Gas Street, which became the first Anglican church in this busy part of the city centre when it opened in February 2016. The building itself was once a Victorian retort house, making gas for street lamps from coal that arrived on the canal. It was derelict when someone in the diocese found it on Rightmove, and today, after a £2.7m purchase and renovation project, it is a beautiful brick cavern, tastefully lit and decorated like an art gallery or a hip startup.Gas Street is one of many new or revitalised churches that the Church of England has “planted” in towns and cities around the country as part of its recent strategy to focus on urban areas, even though rural parishes, with their older populations, have historically been the backbone of the faith.The Renewal and Reform programme has attracted controversy, in part because it has begun to spend the church’s huge investment fund - not just the return it generates - in order to establish new evangelical churches, often in the heart of cities. More than 100 new churches were announced last year in coastal areas, market towns and urban housing estates – a serious attempt to expand Anglicanism, while about 25 churches are closed each year.Some, like St Peter’s in Brighton, have modernised the music, decor and ethos of old churches. Others have occupied secular buildings. For a time, the Harbour church in Portsmouth could be found in an old department store. In Swindon, plans are under way to turn a former Great Western Railway building into a large new place of worship. The Fountains in Bradford will soon take over an old nightclub complex, once home to less godly venues called Revolution, Tequila and Vibe. Gas Street is technically “St Luke’s”, but churchy names are falling out of fashion too.There are about 150 students at Gas Street on the night I visit. Worship starts at 8pm, before which they socialise over plates of paella from a giant pan. It is early in the term and some of them may be taking their first steps into the church, so the organisers asked me not to talk to people at random. Instead I am introduced to several regulars, including Crystal, who is certainly a fine example of how they can help some young people in need. Right now the church’s own needs are nearly as great, however. If they do not ignite an Anglican revival among young people in the next couple of decades, then these new city-centre ventures will be the last stand of the Church of England.For the Church of England, this is not a downward slope. It is the edge of a cliff. According to BSA data, children brought up without religion very rarely find it in adulthood, whereas about half of children from Anglican backgrounds ultimately leave the faith. For roughly every Anglican who dies, therefore, two must be raised to replace them, which requires lots of young Anglican parents … and there are almost none left, and fewer every year. Like all religions, the Church of England says it is keen to improve people’s lives, not just protect its own interests. For Tim and Rachel Hughes, the lead pastors at Gas Street, their work is an attempt to share something they love with others who don’t know much about it. “There hasn’t been a Church of England church in this area,” Tim says. “Central, buzzing with young people. Where people can begin to come and engage with who is Jesus. Is he real? Is he alive? And if he is, what difference might that make for my life?”In many ways, this wave of church-planting in British cities is like modern missionary work. Before moving to Birmingham in 2015 to set up Gas Street, the Hugheses worked at Holy Trinity Brompton, where the Alpha course was developed. HTB, as it is known, now sits at the centre of the network of 60 planted churches in towns and cities all over England, with a slick formula for establishing outposts of Anglican evangelism that now guides the church’s future. You may notice that most of the churches mentioned in this article have excellent – and similar – websites.So far, both Hughes and Herbert are happy with the new church’s progress, although of course it is hard to know how much of the congregation considered themselves Anglican already. Gas Street has done some marketing and work on social media, but for Hughes, the key will be word of mouth. “The way I think you grow, is you envision and equip people to invite their friends,” he says.Besides planting itself in new areas, the Church of England is also using its £8bn investment fund to be more creative with what they offer, especially when it means offering something that laypeople definitely like. In cathedrals, this has taken shape in zany schemes like the helter-skelter installed in Norwich over the summer, or the crazy golf in Rochester. Elsewhere, plans for the Fountains church in Bradford include a gym and a cafe within the complex.St Thomas, Norwich, has pioneered “sports ministry”, providing holiday clubs, five-a-side pitches, netball and other fitness groups to local people. Meanwhile, churches in poorer communities offer debt advice, school uniforms, food banks and other services to help people on low incomes. The plan is that successfully planted big city churches will go on to plant other smaller ones, using the good ideas they learned along the way.Debbie Clinton, director of Renewal and Reform at the Church of England, says: “Particularly over the last few years, we have been trying to look more intentionally at some of the bigger areas. I think the starting place for us is that there are lots of people in cities. Then you start to zoom down in the particular cities.“So some will have a very high student population, and we would look and see, are the churches engaging with that population? If not, let’s go and see how we might do that. In other cities we might look at areas of urban deprivation, particularly in housing estates around the fringes of cities. In central London, we’re looking at workplace populations, where people commute long distances. So what can the church provide for people during the week?”There is a remorseless reality about the demographic challenge that the Church of England faces. From some angles, this search for a secret formula to bring city-dwellers back into church looks like the energetic and imaginative relaunch of a video rental shop. Although, ironically, the scarcity of young Anglicans in the wider world might increase the church’s appeal to those who remain.“It’s like family,” says Hazel Lynch. “That’s the best way to describe it.” Lynch is 22, a recent graduate of the University of Birmingham, and studying for an MA in theology. She has been interested in religion all her life, but not once had a housemate who was Christian. “Before I meet people I think they’re going to be a bit standoffish about it,” she says, “but actually my experience through uni was people being really open.”Many of her friends even came to Gas Street with her, to see what it was like. For Lynch, on the other hand, Gas Street is one place where she is no longer a curiosity. “I walked through the door, and just felt at home,” she says.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce4b4e2d834bb456288395cc3412d88de13222a8/0_158_4384_2631/master/4384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f31572a0321bd157e96714657382b6d","title":"democracy europe 1989 berlin wall velvet revolutions populists","story":"Thirty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and Europe’s velvet revolutions, a new generation is standing up to the populistsImagine someone who had witnessed the liberation of western Europe in 1945 returning in 1975, only to find the dictators coming back. That’s ratherhow it feels revisiting central Europe 30 years after the velvet revolutions of 1989.Earlier this year, I sat in a hotel bar in Budapest with an old anti-communist dissident friend, János Kis, who calmly described the regime of prime minister Viktor Orbán to me as an autocracy. Yet it was Kis who first introduced me to Orbán, back in 1988, presenting the then 25-year-old student as a bright light of a new generation of young liberal democrats. At a rally in Gdańsk in June, I heard European council president Donald Tusk call on his fellow Poles to learn from the example of the Solidarity movement of the 1980s in opposing the country’s nationalist populist Law and Justice party government. Yet Law and Justice triumphed again this month in a general election.In the Czech republic, power is ided between the prime minister Andrej Babiš, an oligarch who was once listed as an informer by the secret police in communist-ruled Slovakia, and the bibulous president, Miloš Zeman, who makes no secret of his sympathetic view of Vladimir Putin’s Russia and Xi Jinping’s China. In the territory that used to be the Stasiland of East Germany, the far-right, virulently xenophobic Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has received the support of a shocking one in four voters, in no less than three recent state elections: in Saxony, Brandenburg and – only last Sunday – in Thuringia. This despite the fact that these states have for nearly three decades been part of one of the richest, most stable democracies in the world, which has made vast financial transfers to precisely these poorer post-communist regions.No wonder commentators are rushing to paint a chiaroscuro picture: from yesterday’s glorious light to today’s encircling darkness. Overstatement is often felt to be essential to get your voice heard in an overcrowded internet marketplace of ideas, and so we read of the coming death of democracy, a new age of the dictators, and so on. This is simplistic and shortsighted.Our mistake after 1989 was not that we celebrated what happened in central Europe – and subsequently in the Baltic republics and the former Soviet Union – as a great triumph for freedom, democracy, Europe and the west. It was all of that. Our mistake was to believe that it was the new normal, the direction history was travelling. Now we are in danger of making the same mistake, only in the other direction. The future triumph of anti-liberal authoritarianism is no more inevitable than was the future triumph of liberal democracy. This cautiously optimistic statement clearly holds true in mature democracies such as Britain and the United States, where the forces of liberal democracy are pushing back hard against the ravages of nationalist populism. But it’s also true in central Europe. Strictly speaking, “illiberal democracy” is a contradiction in terms, like fried snowballs. However, the term is useful to describe the condition of a democracy that is being eroded, but has not been completely destroyed. The decline is still reversible by democratic, legal means, including peaceful mass protest.Leading the democratic fightback in central Europe today is Slovakia, a country which was an authoritarian laggard in the 1990s, and has had more than its fair share of post-communist corruption in recent years. Sparked by the horrifying murder of a journalist who had been trying to expose that corruption, Ján Kuciak, together with his fiancee, mass peaceful protest helped oust a post-communist populist prime minister, Robert Fico. The momentum from those protests contributed to the election this year of a female, liberal, pro-European president, Zuzana Čaputová. Čaputová, who was only 16 at the time of the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia in November 1989, is a fine representative of a new generation shaped by the experience of what I call “post-Wall” Europe. So when I go to Bratislava next month, there will be much to celebrate.I will take the train from Bratislava to Prague, crossing what is now an international frontier between Slovakia and the Czech Republic, in time to witness what promises to be a large demonstration against the dreadful duo of Babiš and Zeman. It will be organised by a student-led movement called A Million Moments For Democracy, to mark the 30th anniversary of the beginning of the 1989 Velvet Revolution. They already put together a huge demo this summer at Letná park, the site of the largest peaceful protest in 1989. One of the organisers, Benjamin Roll, a cheerful, bearded theology student, told me his father had been a sound engineer at the 1989 demo, literally amplifying the voice of Václav Havel. So in the Czech Republic, too, there are grounds for hope.For the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Wall, I shall be back in Berlin, staying in the hotel that was then the showcase Grand Hotel of the communist regime and is now a Westin. Shocking though the AfD results are, they don’t fundamentally threaten German democracy. That cannot be said of Law and Justice rule in Poland, for the party of Jarosław Kaczyński clearly wants to follow the Hungarian example. It is pursuing Orbánisation à la polonaise. But it faces powerful independent media, major opposition parties, big cities under opposition control, and a highly mobilised civil society.By far the worst case is Hungary. Freedom House last year downgraded its status to “partly free”, the only EU member state to be so classified. Indeed, after careful analysis I have argued that Hungary is no longer a democracy – not even an illiberal one – but rather a regime of the kind that political scientists call “competitive authoritarian”. Yet even there, the opposition managed this month to win the mayoralty of Budapest. They did this by effectively uniting, something not so far achieved by Poland’s opposition parties – nor, alas, by the opposition to Brexit in Britain. Winning Budapest doesn’t suddenly make Hungary a democracy again, for after all, the Turkish opposition – by uniting – won the mayoralty of Istanbul, and no one in their right minds would pretend that the Turkey of Recep Tayyip Erdogan is a democracy. But it is a distinct point of light.Inevitably, the focus of most writing about this 30th anniversary, including my own, has been on the question: “what has gone wrong?” But if the post-Wall generation in central Europe fights for the liberties it has grown up with, and the EU starts standing up for democracy in its own member states, there is every reason to believe that the 40th anniversary, in 2029, will again give us cause for celebration.• Timothy Garton Ash is a  columnist.

As one of his very few black fans, I described how, after years of giving him the benefit of the doubt, buying every record he ever made, and leaping on stage to kiss him at shows, I felt personally betrayed by his repeated demonstrations of intolerance.Fast-forward a few months, and on Sunday I woke to friends sending me pictures of Morrissey wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words “Fuck the ”. One message was accompanied by expletives, another by the eye-roll emoji. Another simply said, “You did this.”Now, I can’t take sole credit for Morrissey’s hostility towards this newspaper. Many colleagues have spoken out about his outbursts. But given that I was publicly invited by Morrissey’s manager to the Hollywood Bowl concert where he donned the sweary garment, and then refused an interview when I tried to take him up on the offer, the T-shirt does feel like it was aimed at me.The invitation was set in motion the day after my article was published in June, when his manager, Peter Katsis, posted on Morrissey’s official Facebook page asking me to join his autumn tour of America, all expenses paid, to see for myself that (in block capitals) “MORRISSEY IS NOT RACIST.”Was this a genuine offer? Many of Morrissey’s 1.3 million Facebook followers thought so and encouraged me to take the gig. What an opportunity to finally get answers to all the questions I’d had since my teens. I was genuinely excited.I emailed Katsis at his offices in Beverly Hills, accepting the invitation and his one proviso – to “find a better paper than the  to sell it to, since they have the absolute lowest circulation of all the major dailies in the UK”.I explained that the  had shaped my identity from an early age as much as Morrissey had, because it stood up for marginalised people – as he once did – sought to uncover truths and spoke its mind.To get across how much this invite meant to me, I told Morrissey’s team that I was prepared to break my boycott of Trump’s America, which I haven’t visited since 2015. Katsis and I talked on the phone, and he seemed pleasant enough, even if I had to bite my tongue at some of his more cringeworthy defences of Morrissey: that he had people of colour over to his house for dinner all the time, that he’d never heard him say anything racist that he was simply a provocateur who had never voted for a political party in his life.Later, he sent me a picture of the soul singer Thelma Houston with Morrissey in a studio where they’d just cut a track, as if to say, “Look, look! She’s black!” As I say, he was nice enough, but also a bit like an out-of-touch uncle who didn’t really get it and thought I could be swayed into writing a sympathetic piece on his wayward star. Regardless, I spent the whole summer pitching the story to editors of various publications. Every approach was met with a similar response. They were all intrigued by the idea – a tour diary, on the road with Morrissey through Trump’s America – but despite giving it some thought, said it wasn’t right for their periodical. You see, Moz, your T-shirt should really say “Fuck all press” – as, sadly, that’s what you will end up with.Then, finally, a breakthrough came. GQ, the well-respected, glossy men’s mag, said that if Morrissey agreed to a full interview, it would publish it. It seemed the perfect fit. Everything was in place. I got my US work visa, agreed to Morrissey’s amended timetable – not the first week of the tour as first promised, but the final date at the Hollywood Bowl.And then? Morrissey refused to grant an interview. The reasons given were that he didn’t trust journalists, used his own website to put out communiques, and hadn’t done an interview since one with Der Spiegel two years ago, which ended badly.I’m left feeling that the invitation was intended to garner good publicity, and that there was never any intention of confronting my questions head on. I was supposed to meet Morrissey to see for myself that he’s not racist. Sadly, he declined the opportunity to prove it.• Joshua Surtees is a columnist, feature writer and reporter based in London and Trinidad"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9f8d00be62f02f49ddb77e08fba200f0420f987/394_245_4360_2748/master/4360.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7cbd923dfa6f946db058070e0d8cef7 720w","title":"olivette otele uk first black female history professor to research bristol slavery links","story":"Olivette Otele says she wants to ‘facilitate dialogue that needs to take place’ at University of BristolThe University of Bristol has appointed a black history professor to explore the city’s involvement in the transatlantic slave trade.Olivette Otele will take up her role as professor of the history of slavery in January 2020. She will be based at the university’s history department and the Centre for Black Humanities, where she will work with staff, students and communities.Otele became the UK’s first female black history professor after being awarded a professorship and a chair in history by Bath Spa University in 2018. Her research, conducted over almost two decades, examines the legacies of colonial pasts as well as a reluctance to address such issues.As part of her new role, Otele will undertake a two-year research project on the involvement of the University of Bristol and the wider city in the transatlantic slave trade.The city’s official participation in the transatlantic slave trade started in 1698, though experts say Bristolian ships illegally traded in slaves well before then. Bristol merchants financed more than 2,000 slaving voyages between 1698 and 1807, with ships carrying more than 500,000 people from Africa to slave labour in the Americas.Speaking about her new appointment, Otele said: “I hope to bring together Bristolians from all communities, and scholars, artists and educators who are willing to contribute to a stronger and fairer society.“I want students to see me as a facilitator of a dialogue that needs to take place and that is about the role of the University of Bristol in the transatlantic slave trade. I want to produce a rigorous and an extensive piece of research that will be relevant to the university, to the city and that will be a landmark in the way Britain examines, acknowledges and teaches the history of enslavement.”Otele holds a PhD in history from Sorbonne University in France and researches transnational history , in particular the link between history, collective memory and geopolitics in relation to British and French colonial pasts.Prof Judith Squires, the provost and deputy vice-chancellor of the university, said: “We are proud to be appointing someone of Prof Otele’s experience and standing to lead on this important issue for us.“As an institution founded in 1909, we are not a direct beneficiary of the slave trade, but we fully acknowledge that we financially benefited indirectly via philanthropic support from families who had made money from businesses involved in the transatlantic slave trade.“This new role provides us with a unique and important opportunity to interrogate our history, working with staff, students and local communities to explore the university’s historical links to slavery and to debate how we should best respond to our past in order to shape our future as an inclusive university community.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/513448d2ef266a931eed626ac58b00052a9b340d/0_125_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bda7d6fa54593c7673f26de8ef61a7ff","title":"technical schools lavished with gove funding criticised by watchdog","story":"Many university technical colleges are less than half fullTechnical schools set up with lavish public funds by Michael Gove are half full and often score lower results than other secondaries, Whitehall’s spending watchdog has found.University technical colleges (UTCs), a type of free school focusing on teaching students who are usually aged between 14 and 19, were also less likely to be rated as good or outstanding by Ofsted, a report by the National Audit Office said.The UTC programme has cost £792m since it was launched in 2010 with the aim of employers and universities working together to provide technical education, according to the NAO report.Designed by Lord Baker, a minister under Margaret Thatcher, they were intended to give 14-year-olds the option of a technical, artistic and creative education, or an academic education.A total of 58 UTCs have opened in the past nine years, but 10 no longer operate as technical colleges, the NAO’s investigation found. The rest are operating at less than half capacity on average.In 2010, Gove hailed the technical colleges as a crucial part of the free school project. Seven years later, he conceded in an article for the Times that they had failed. “There comes a point when the evidence has accumulated and the verdict is clear and even the most optimistic of us has to acknowledge that Godot won’t arrive, the base metal won’t turn into gold and the emperor really is in the altogether,” Gove wrote.Meg Hillier, who chairs the public accounts committee, said: “This report provides further evidence as to why the Department for Education is my top department of concern.”Baker, who founded the Baker Dearing Educational Trust to promote UTCs, said: “This report records the price of everything and the value of nothing. UTCs should be judged by the success of their students becoming apprentices, studying STEM subjects at a university and getting a job as a technician or an engineer.”“As this report recognises, we have taken significant action to support and raise the profile of UTCs to make sure they continue to play a role in our erse education system and provide the skills that employers need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f73e2dc8ae9a9e6c276fcd7578d0f1907771e662/0_263_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b27202c2c5c26afec491af34176036d6","title":"bus sized fatberg cleared from london sewer","story":"Blockage in Greenwich prompts Thames Water to reissue warning about waste disposalA 40-tonne fatberg the size of a double-decker bus has been cleared from a London sewer by Thames Water engineers who pulled out some of it by hand.The mass of fat, grease and other materials that weighed the same as three red buses, was discovered earlier this year clogging up a sewer in Greenwich, the water company said.Fatbergs are formed when fat, oil and grease are poured down sinks and drains and combine with items that should not be flushed down the toilet, such as unflushable wet wipes, nappies and cotton buds.Thames Water’s network protection team has been visiting food establishments in the area, to make sure they are not putting fat, grease and oil down their sinks and that fat traps are installed and working.Matt Rimmer, Thames Water’s head of waste networks, said: “This was a massive and disgusting blockage that took a great deal of effort and teamwork to clear and get the sewer working well again.“I’m happy that our team was able to get down and work hard to quickly to clear the fatberg before it could cause problems for our customers and the environment.“We’d urge everyone to help fight the fatberg by only flushing the 3Ps – pee, poo and paper – as well as disposing of fat and oils in the bin, not the sink.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03ea95e4f88a637afa3ea2db652017cb00307733/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ad49c59725075ea2f08f6ed45928837e 960w","title":"gdt european wildlife photographer of the year 2019 in pictures","story":"The Society of German Nature Photographers has chosen its winners and runners-up.

Halloween is huge. What was once a cobwebby half-term afterthought has reinvented itself. Olde-world graveyards and broomsticks have been ditched in favour of Instagrammable nail art and carefully curated pumpkin stalls.There are lots of reasons why Halloween is a really bad idea. It is the demon enabler of the evil sugar industry. It is an environmental disaster zone of disposable plastic tat – the charity Hubbub recently estimated that throwaway costumes and accessories generate polluting oil-based plastic equivalent to 83m plastic bottles. And, if that wasn’t bad enough, every year it completely spoils an entire week of Strictly Come Dancing with green body paint and coloured contact lenses. Yet, in the end, none of this matters, because Halloween is supposed to be nasty. The worse it gets, the better. Deal with it, because it is not going away.Halloween is scary, funny and probably bad for you. It is hypersexualised and narcissistic and all about how good you look. It is restless, always on the prowl for the most up-to-date joke, the newest hot take, the most zeitgeisty meme. In contrast to Christmas and Easter, which are convened around wholesome, home-cooked family feasts, Halloween catering is all about the sweets andor alcohol, depending on your age bracket. It rewards the skills of being good at putting on makeup, overthinking pop culture and having an encyclopedic knowledge of internet memes. And it looks great in photos. It is, in other words, the most 2019 party it is possible to imagine.While impressing your friends with your fabulous Christmas party dress is still cute, in a retro, early-00s-Richard-Curtis-movie kind of a way, it is your Halloween look that now wins the most points. Halloween is like the Met Gala, but everyone is invited. It requires wit as well as showmanship, gore as well as glamour. And it has to be rethought every year – sustainability red flag here, as discussed, but all the more reason to aim a bit higher than whatever crudely styled, statically charged tat you can get next-day-delivered on Amazon Prime. Read on for the looks that will make the cut this Halloween.The 31 October deadline will not come to pass, but the Halloween timing the PM repeated at every opportunity has fused the longest-running political horror show with the festival of terror and absurdity. Johnson – this year’s pop culture baddie – is the obvious look just rough up the Donald Trump wig from Halloween two years ago and add a bike helmet. But the Tim Burton vibes of Jacob Rees-Mogg also have potential. Maximum points to the person who figures out how to dress up as the Irish backstop. I have been working on a plan involving an Irish flag with a hard border, but I would be lying if I said I could explain it.“Avocado” was the word of the first half of this decade and “surreal” has been the word of the second half, a term that came into mainstream culture as politics became more and more absurd both here and in the US. Quirkily cartoonish takes on modern life are very Halloween 2019. Upcycle the papier mache art project that Year 3 made when they read James and the Giant Peach and combine with a model of the White House for a Dali-esque impeachment costume. Or team giant Chanel earrings, bronzer and false eyelashes with a Sherlock Holmes costume for a Coleen RooneyWagatha Christie look.No need for any of that goodwill-to-all-mankind, better-to-give-than-to-receive nonsense that you get at Christmas. Halloween is all about you. However, it is no longer socially acceptable to add “sexy” to a noun at random. A witch in a corset, a nurse in suspenders? Babes, the 20th century called – it needs its dressing-up box back. Instead, recruit a photogenic friend or family member and have them dress up as you. The Kardashian clan are, as ever, ahead of the curve here: three days before the date itself, one-year-old Stormi Webster, daughter of Kylie Jenner, was being proclaimed on social media as the “winner” of Halloween thanks to a bespoke outfit recreating her mum’s lilac feathered Versace Met Gala gown. Jessica Biel dressing as her husband Justin Timberlake (the ‘NSync era version) also podiums here. File under: because internet.It is like virtue-signalling, but without morals, and it is major. Obviously you have flawless taste, so this is your time to shine. Be the Hot Priest from Fleabag. (Also: so easy. Don’t forget the can of G\u0026ampT.) Or pay homage to Succession: is there anything scarier than Logan in a shawl-collar cable knit? Note: you can’t do Stranger Things – that was old last year.The late Karl Lagerfeld and his beloved kitten are the Gomez and Morticia of the 2019 Halloween circuit. For Karl, dust your hair with talcum powder, flip up the collar of your stiffest white shirt and pin in place with a fancy brooch. If you don’t have a brooch, one of those pearl hairclips that are everywhere and a couple of safety pins will do the trick. Add black shades, fingerless gloves, a fan and a can of Diet Coke. For Choupette, white cat ears and a mohair jumper should do it. If you are keen to show off your abs, there is always J-Lo in that green dress on the Versace catwalk. Or for insider fashion lolz, raid secondhand stores for a tweed suit and a boater hat and channel the gatecrasher who stormed the Chanel runway at Paris fashion week this month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a75082955b937fa9366cc04adc7250306625a9b/0_37_5730_3438/master/5730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e5be4272bc3ab47d807578534ac280b","title":"share your worst halloween pumpkin carvings","story":"We’d like to see your worst Halloween pumpkin carvings and find out what happened to them.

It’s an odd sight as the rest of the ground is otherwise quite decent. Thinking about the ground’s history has made me think of another question: when it was redeveloped in 2000, the ends that traditionally housed the hardcore support and away fans were reversed.

Bramall Lane is one of only two English grounds which have hosted an FA Cup final, an England football international and a Test match (the other is The Oval). Bolton’s Burnden Park had a Normid superstore covering half of one end until the club moved to their new stadium in Horwich 1997.“No discussion of three-sided grounds can be complete without mentioning the County Ground in Northampton,” pipes up Stewart Robinson. “Until 1994 it was shared between Northampton Town and Northamptonshire County Cricket Club, with the two pitches alongside one another. Football spectators in the Abingdon Avenue stand had an unimpeded view across to the cricket pavilion, nearly 200 metres away.”“Has any side got a worse pointsdistance ratio than Carlisle to Plymouth?” asks Richard van der Wilshuizen. “One point in the last 10,000 miles seems about as poor a ratio as you can get in the UK.”We’re pretty sure Carlisle own that unwanted record for league games in the UK Richard but, globally, we can’t imagine any team has travelled further than Luch-Energiya Vlaostok for so little reward. Here’s Russel Yong: “From 2006 to 2008, Luch-Energiya Vlaostok were members of the Russian Premier League for the first and only time in their history. Being from the eastern extremity of Russia meant some epic long-distance travelling their closest rivals were Siberian team Tom Tomsk, ‘only’ 3,465 miles from Vlaostok, while Spartak Nalchik’s home ground was an eye-watering 6,048 miles away.“Luch were famously decent at home and abysmal travellers, which made for some pretty poor away records, such as 0-0-3 (W-D-L) from three games v Zenit St Petersburg (5,984 miles), or 0 points for 35,904 miles travelled 0-1-1 from two games v FC Rostov (5,901 miles), one point for 23,604 miles travelled and 0-0-3 v CSKA Moscow (5,697 miles), 0 points for 34,182 miles travelled.“In 16 away games against the six Moscow teams (CSKA, Dynamo, FC Moscow, Lokomotiv, Spartak and Torpedo), Luch gained only three points, all from draws. If you calculate it based on the driving distance tofrom each team’s home ground and Luch’s Dynamo Stadium (and given some fans didn’t think driving distance was an impediment, I don’t see why not), Luch travelled a staggering 182,052 miles to and from Moscow, 60,684 miles per point, the equivalent of going almost two and a half times around the Equator to get a draw, and going over three-quarters the distance to the Moon to snag a win.”“I seem to remember that Darren Anderton left a game, not due to injury, but because he lost a contact lens” wrote Chris Stanley in 2009. “Have any other players suffered a similar fate?”There are a few such examples. Perhaps the most famous was during the World Cup qualifier between Wales and Scotland in 1985, the match which tragically ended with the death of Jock Stein.As Wales mounted a series of attacks Jim Leighton, the Scotland goalkeeper, flapped at crosses, dropped shots and looked generally confused. His teammates were convinced he was concussed but in fact he wore contact lenses – a fact he had kept to himself for seven years – and one of them had been lost in the Ninian Park mud. He confessed the truth to Stein at half-time and was promptly replaced by Alan Rough.• For more from the font of nerdvana, click this thing here.“Vitória FC are 14th in the Portuguese league, with eight points from eight games,” notes David Valente.

But there are not examples, at least in the modern era, of players across an entire league threatening action. It marks a huge change in attitude.Previously female footballers were sort of willing to shut up, to be grateful for the right to play. The demands to be aptly compensated for representing your country felt a just cause, but this did not translate to the game at club level.What makes this threatened action significantis that it is about the day-to-day, the right to a decent standard of living and an unwillingness to go on accepting that professional standards be demanded of players without the contracts and pay to reflect it.The top contracted players are standing shoulder to shoulder with the poorest. Six players from the champions, Atlético Madrid, attended the meeting which voted so overwhelmingly for action. Four turned out from Barcelona, including the Spanish national team’s fourth-highest goalscorer, Jenni Hermoso. They are symbolically backing the push for a collective bargaining agreement across the league, which would include as a minimum €16,000 (£13,800) annually for a 40-hour working week, €12,000 for a part-time 30-hour week, maternity leave and paid time off.These wages are low. They may be higher than Spain’s minimum wage of approximately €12,600 a year for 2019, but they are significantly lower than the average wage of Spanish workers which is €23,000, according to the country’s office of national statistics.There may be a fear that clubs will struggle to pay, in particular the four teams without the backing of a men’s club – Madrid CFF, Sporting de Huelva, Logroño and UDG Tenerife – but serious questions have to be asked about the commitment of those clubs and the league if that is the case. Clubs receive €350,000 a season from the federation (a requirement as a government organisation, not out of the goodness of their hearts) and they are being offered €500,000 by the league for their TV rights. If the welfare and support of players is not the number one priority and is not what sustainability is being built around, then what is the focus?For the 12 teams backed by wealthy men’s clubs the excuses are even more moot.That clubs are digging in and resistant to the most minimal of employment rights for their players ispretty galling.Strike action is always a last resort. That it has taken 18 meetings across 13 months is testament to this, but now the players have had enough.Whether we reach 16 November at an impasse remains to be seen. The threat of industrial action can be very powerful whereas clubs are happy to let talks rumble on in the background, strike action hits them where it hurts: in their pockets. TV rights and sponsorship deals depend on games happening. It is also extremely important that a club maintains a good image for invested parties – funnily enough, striking female footballers is not a good look.Women’s football is entering a new era of professionalism and mass audiences and players are feeling empowered by it. Spain’s players are leading the way, but we can be sure they will not be the last to collectively organise on this scale.• Chelsea’s defender Maria Thorisdóttir has undergone surgery on the leg she fractured in training. Having scored a blistering late winner as Chelsea came from behind to beat Arsenal, the Norwegian suffered the break in the run-up to Sunday’s defeat of West Ham and will miss the rest of 2019.• Reign FC head coach Vlatko Andonovski has been unveiled as the manager of the US women’s national team. The 43-year-old, who has worked with Megan Rapinoe at Reign FC, takes over from two-times World Cup-winning manager Jill Ellis. It is expected that he will retain Dawn Scott as the high performance coach and the goalkeeper coach Graeme Abel.• Phil Neville has recalled Toni Duggan for England’s upcoming friendlies against Germany and the Czech Republic. Striker Ellen White and Georgia Stanway are training with the side as they continue to make their return to full fitness. Most notably Chelsea’s Fran Kirby has been omitted. The PSG defender Alana Cook, a non-playing squad member for the previous camp, has not been called up and is expected to be included in Vlatko Andonovski’s first USWNT squad as the two nations vie for the allegiance of the dual citizen.• Four of Germany’s World Cup squad are missing from the group that will travel to England for the showpiece Wembley fixture. The goalkeeper Almuth Schult, Turbine Potsdam’s Svenja Huth, captain Alex Popp and debut World Cup goalscorer Giulia Gwinn have not recovered from injury. Arsenal’s Leonie Maier and Manchester City’s Pauline Bremer are in the squad.• North Carolina Courage cruised past Chicago Red Star to confirm a second consecutive NWSL championship. Goals from the Brazilian Debinha and the USWNT World Cup winners Jess McDonald, Crystal Dunn and Sam Mewis sealed the emphatic victory in from of a sold-out 10,277 crowd.

Splashing the cash is not Preston’s style – their starting XI against Blackburn last weekend cost £1.6m – and they deserve credit for doing things differently.It is a model that continues to serve them well after 14 matches Preston are second in the table and hopeful of gatecrashing the top six after a couple of near misses. Preston finished seventh, two points off the play-offs in Alex Neil’s first season in charge, and there is a belief that West Bromwich Albion’s spring pursuit of their Scottish manager disrupted their rhythm at a key stage last season. Preston’s recruitment, led by Neil and the former Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale, an adviser to the owner Trevor Hemmings, has been impressive. Neil and Ridsdale regularly attend matches together, and Ridsdale speaks daily to Hemmings, who lives on the Isle of Man.Preston are not parsimonious – they paid Barnsley and Coventry seven-figure fees for Brad Potts and Tom Bayliss respectively – but prudent. The onus is on finding value for money. Callum Robinson and Jordan Hugill, £170,000 and £25,000 signings from Aston Villa and Port Vale respectively, were both sold for £8m in the past two years, and the team that came from two goals down to beat Blackburn on Saturday included the Republic of Ireland midfielder Alan Browne, a £15,000 signing from Cork City five years ago, and Daniel Johnson, a £50,000 recruit from Aston Villa, as well as three free transfers: Darnell Fisher, Patrick Bauer and Paul Gallagher, who is in his fourth spell at the club.Preston recruit similarly to Bristol City and Brentford in scouring the lower leagues for young and hungry talent, as well as finding homes for those with limited opportunities at Premier League clubs, such as Ben Pearson, who has excelled since joining from Manchester United. They are proactive and have already identified next summer’s transfer targets.Preston boast the best home record in the Championship – only Manchester City have won at Deepdale this season – and they are also the ision’s leading scorers. Tom Barkhuizen, for whom Preston paid Morecambe £150,000 compensation two years ago, has flourished, while Sean Maguire, Jayden Stockley and David Nugent, who returned to the club this summer, provide a variety of attacking options. Only Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ollie Watkins have scored more league goals this season than Johnson, who has relished playing as a No 10 and shares penalty duties with Gallagher, an evergreen performer.Last season Preston were bottom after 11 matches and playing catch-up but, before travelling to Charlton on Sunday, they are two points off leaders West Brom, whose £8m outlay on Kenneth Zohore this summer highlights a financial disparity Preston’s wage bill is among the lowest in the ision at around £13m – a third of West Brom’s last season.An eight-point blanket covers the top half and, in the absence of runaway leaders, plenty of teams will fancy their chances of promotion, or at least being in the mix in May. No team have suffered heartbreak in the play-offs more than Preston – failing nine times in 10 attempts – but that does not stop them from wanting to get there. Preston are one of five Championship clubs to have never played in the Premier League, but it feels as if they are getting closer.“I think the difference is as a group of players we understand what it’s going to take to achieve something this year, ie to get into the top six or even get into the top two,” says Johnson. “I think our squad is a lot stronger now. You obviously want to put on a performance but you can’t always win the pretty way and we are well adapted to changing our style to dig out results. We have got everything in abundance as a team. We have been together for many years and we have been hanging around that top half for quite a while.• With Jim Bentley stepping down after more than eight years in charge at Morecambe, the Wycombe manager, Gareth Ainsworth, has taken his mantle as the longest-serving manager in England’s top four isions at seven years and 35 days. After Ainsworth, the longest-serving managers are Eddie Howe, Sean Dyche, Mauricio Pochettino and Accrington Stanley’s John Coleman. Kevin Ellison and Barry Roche have been placed in interim charge at Morecambe. Ainsworth, as well as guiding Wycombe to second in League One, has been busy making an early play for the Christmas No 1 with his band, the Cold Blooded Hearts, recording a cover of Dion’s The Wanderer, which will be released as a B-side and is on the matchday playlist at Adams Park.• Stoke’s woes have perhaps taken some of the heat off Jonathan Woodgate at Middlesbrough but pressure is building on the former defender, who has won two of his opening 15 games as a manager. Boro are the lowest scorers in the ision, with 11 goals from 14 matches, and last Saturday they mustered one shot on target in a 0-0 draw against a Fulham side reduced to 10 men after 17 minutes. They travel to Derby on Saturday hoping to end a seven-match winless run.• Sol Campbell worked miracles at Macclesfield and, if Southend are to get out of trouble in League One, he will need to do so again. They have lost 12 of their 15 matches and are nine points from safety. The size of the task is not lost on Campbell, who takes his side to Sunderland on Saturday before a trip to Portsmouth. “I’ve got to overachieve, the players have got to overachieve,” he said. “We cannot waste a second.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2390b2e17e5e050d68a14ce1ad3e9edef9f40599/0_0_4820_2893/master/4820.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d76ea79181f34a7f6c46d603125d0d9f","title":"has your relationship been affected by brexit divisions","story":"We want to hear from couples whose opposing views on Brexit have impacted their relationship.The EU has agreed to Boris Johnson’s request for a Brexit extension to 31 January 2020 with the option for the UK to leave earlier if a deal is ratified.The agreement has cleared the way for a general election, with the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party pledging to back one on 9 December if no deal on 31 October is “taken off the table”.

But I think my attention  was a bit short for academic life, so I started writing science stories for newspapers. My first staff job was at BBC Tomorrow’s World magazine, then BBC News Online. I went to New Scientist next and then the Financial Times. In 2008, I was delighted to be hired by the , which was – and is! – my favourite paper.How has awareness of the climate crisis changed in the last decade? What do you think the big milestones have been? When I joined the , concern about the climate crisis was running high, following a landmark report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Al Gore’s film, An Inconvenient Truth – the IPCC and Gore went on to win the Nobel peace prize. But it was seen as a future problem. The transformative moment was meant to come at the 2009 UN climate change conference in Copenhagen. But it didn’t happen and after that the impacts of the global financial crisis grabbed all the attention. It wasn’t until 2015, by which time the role of human activities in driving climate change was undeniable, that a big step forward was taken with the Paris deal. How has your role in covering the environment changed in that time? has always taken the environment very seriously. In the decade I have been here, the team has expanded. But the basic approach has largely stayed the same – environmental issues affect everything, so should feature across all our coverage: reporting, exposing and holding to account. Today, the climate crisis is here, evident in more frequent and more severe extreme weather and climate change deniers have been relegated to the far fringes. With the global youth climate strikes inspired by Greta Thunberg and the Extinction Rebellion protests, 2019 feels like a new chapter. Those who have campaigned for decades are feeling hopeful. What would you say are the most important environmental issues?The climate emergency is the best known, and it will take systemic change to beat it. But the annihilation of wildlife and the destruction of nature is just as crucial in my view – we depend on the natural world for almost everything. The huge scale of the losses – from forests to insects to marine life – has only really become widely reported in the last few years. Pollution is the third issue, particularly the toxic air that causes millions of early deaths every year. Air is actually getting cleaner in some rich nations, but the understanding of how damaging it is – on everything from intelligence to miscarriages – is only really emerging now. Chemical pollution is also a serious global problem, from fertiliser to pesticides to PCBsWhat frustrates you about how these issues are sometimes be covered?One thing is the charge of hypocrisy that is often levelled at environment campaigners because they have a TV or something. Just because you have to live in the world as it is today doesn’t mean you can’t campaign to make it a better place tomorrow. But I think hypocrisy is the attack made by people who know they’ve lost the real argument.Has your work influencedinformed the way you live your life?Yes. It’s impossible to write about it every day and not act. I am vegan at home and whenever I can elsewhere. My home is fully insulated and my energy supplier is renewable. I rarely fly for holidays – one short haul flight in the last couple of years – and usually go to Ireland by ferry to surf. I’ve also cycled to work for about 13 years now – it’s cheap, fast and healthy. Being green is often worthwhile for many reasons.What would you say to readers who want to tackle the environmental crisis?The big shifts will be driven by the governments we elect (in democracies) and the companies to which we give our custom. Demanding urgent action from those leaders is vital. But personal action is also important, in itself and as an encouragement to others. The biggest action, according to scientists, is having fewer children, but that of course is a deeply personal and complex choice. Flying less and eating less meat and dairy also make big cuts in your impact, as does driving fewer petrol-powered miles and insulating your home.How can we build on the urgency we’ve seen from many campaigners in 2019 and keep the spotlight fixed firmly on the big changes we need?We are in a race against time and it’s not at all certain that we are going to win. We understand the problems and what we have to do, more or less, but the pace of action is far too slow. Putting pressure on politicians and business leaders is key – giving them a strong reason to move faster. The good news is that many solutions gain their own momentum once started. In many places, solar and wind power is now the cheapest electricity, and electric cars are the cheapest to own. But there are still big problems to solve, including agriculture and aviation. The young people involved in the climate strikes will be running the world in the not-too-distant future. But we have to make sure we are still in the race by then.What have been the highlights of your reporting at the  so far? What has made you most proud?I have written nearly 2,000 stories for the , and I’d hope most of them have played a part in building awareness of environmental issues. It’s usually hard to know how much impact stories have behind the scenes, but the restoration of slashed flood defence funding in England followed a lot of reporting by me, as did the EU ban on neonicotinoid pesticides, which harm bees. The recent resignation of the executive director of the UN environment programme also followed a string of my stories, which was a good example of the  holding power to account. The environment team get a lot of positive feedback from readers, scientists and policymakers, which is very heartening. One prominent scientist recently told me: “Thank God for the !”What is the area within your work and reporting expertise that you feel most passionately about?Usually the story I’m working on right now. But in recent years I’ve done a lot on pesticides, insects, the impact of livestock, microplastics and harmful subsidies. And badgers. I’ve written a lot about the cull in England. One of my editors here said I had “made the  the paper of choice for small mammals”, which may or may not have been a compliment.What about the highs and lows of doing the job?Often, this is the best job in the world. I’ve been fortunate to see a lot of the Earth’s natural beauty. I’ve tracked forest elephants in Gabon, been swimming with giant mantas in the Males and walked through extraordinary landscapes high in the Andes. On the other hand, almost every day I have to report more destruction and degradation of the environment. The most heartbreaking story I have covered is the poisoning of children with lead in a former mining town in Zambia. But I was glad to be able to expose it at least.What’s next for you and the team?The next 12 months are going to be absolutely pivotal for the world. There’s a major UN bioersity conference in China next year – the targets set a decade ago have been woefully missed. The UN climate summit in Glasgow, UK, in 2020 will also be vital – nations are going to have to make big increases in the carbon cuts they pledge if we are to get anywhere near the 1.5C temperature rise seen as a safety limit. And we’ll be reporting day in, day out, across the world holding nations and companies to account for the environment and for social justice.What makes the  unique?John Vidal, my brilliant predecessor as environment editor, says: “Environment is the world and everything in it”, and I think the issue now permeates all the newspaper’s coverage. That is because the  has always taken the issue seriously, with full support from the top and the resources to match. Our readers really care too, and they tell us.

We’ll look at them, and marvel at how much careers have changed.Technology has profoundly transformed the nature of the work we do. The Office for National Statistics predicts that 1.5 million British workers risk losing their jobs as a result of automation, with farm workers, waiting staff and shelf fillers notably at risk. At the same time, globalisation has decimated UK manufacturing, with jobs outsourced to developing nations with cheaper workforces and fewer labour protections. The rise of the gig economy has also seen a growing number of people in precarious, low-paid temporary work, without the perks of permanent employees: maternity leave, sick pay or a pension. What this means is that the halcyon days of a job for life are slipping away. The future is coming for us, whether we want it or not.But it is not here just yet. There are still people who have proudly spent their entire lives with one company. What can we learn about the world of work from the most loyal employees?Andrew Gomez is pinning a summer jacket in navy-blue Italian wool, a silver thimble on his right forefinger, when I arrive. He has worked here, in the basement workshop underneath the luxuriously appointed showroom of Gieves \u0026amp Hawkes, for 45 years.After training as a tailor in his native Spain, Gomez came to Gieves \u0026amp Hawkes in September 1974 looking for a job. They asked him to tailor a “full baste” – which means he had to half make a bespoke suit – as a test. After inspecting it, the manager asked him to come in the next Monday. “They fell in love with my work,” Gomez laughs.He didn’t plan to spend his career at Gieves \u0026amp Hawkes. But every time Gomez muttered about leaving, his bosses would give him a pay rise. “They said: ‘We’ll give you the money you want! No one else will pay you more than us. You’ll have a job for life.’” So he stayed.Time passed. He was a speedy – and hard – worker. “No one ever complained about my work, or gave me anything back to redo,” he says proudly. “I always did my best.” He believes this is why he has lasted so long in the organisation. “You cannot just work for money,” he says seriously. “You have a responsibility to do a proper job. You have to make the effort every single day, otherwise the job will go wrong.”Nearly half a century on, Gomez has made, by his own estimation, 15,000 jackets. But he isn’t ready to retire yet. “My wife and daughter tell me off all the time. They say: ‘Why do you work? Why don’t you retire?’ But I wouldn’t have anything else to do. I don’t want to stay home and be bored.”June Hallworth, 81, the Davenport Arms, Stockport, Greater ManchesterThe Davenport Arms – known locally as the Thief’s Neck – has been in Hallworth’s family for 87 years. She started behind the bar in 1957, when she began going out with John, who would become her husband. His father, Eric, managed the pub. “It was the first pub I had ever been in,” Hallworth remembers. “I’d come and stand at the bar when John was working. And then my father-in-law said: ‘It’s no use you standing there! Get behind the bar and get something done.’”Bar work didn’t come easily to her at first. “I was a nervous wreck. People would be asking for drinks, and I didn’t understand what they meant.” With time came confidence. “I could stand up for myself and answer people back, rather than being meek and mild.”Despite a life spent around alcohol, Hallworth doesn’t actually drink. “My husband used to ask: ‘Is there nothing you like the look of?’” Yet she has witnessed changing drinking habits: before, you’d struggle to get people out of the pub after last orders. “You’d have to shout at them to drink up. Now, people drink earlier. You can lock up more easily.”Hallworth still does five two-hour shifts a week. She’ll carry food from the kitchen and pull pints, although she has stopped changing barrels. “I like the social side of it,” she tells me. “Being able to talk to people. Since my husband died, it has been a blessing for me to keep coming in here and meeting people, rather than being on my own.”The pub still has customers whom Hallworth served in the 80s and 90s. “They say: ‘You don’t look any different, June.’ I say: ‘I must have looked like an old-so-and-so 20 years ago.’”Although Hallworth never thought she would work in a pub her whole life, she is at peace with how things turned out. “I don’t know any other life. I’ve been quite happy.”The first time Talbot saw a doubledecker bus, he remembers thinking: “‘Yes!’ It had always been a dream to drive a doubledecker bus,” he says. “I wanted to get into that chair.” He applied to National Express in 1990 and never looked back.“I’ll be honest, I clipped a few car mirrors when I started,” Talbot admits. And passengers can be tricky. “You can get some very aggressive passengers,” he says. “Even when they’re shouting at you, you have to stay cool and calm.”In 2013, Talbot took leave from National Express to do a six-month tour of Afghanistan as an army reserve sergeant. “I just loved that green uniform,” Talbot says of his parallel career. “I’ve always been interested in weapons. I thought: the only way to fire a gun is to be in the army.”He loves his driving job because he’s a sociable person. “It’s really nice to be able to have a good talk with the passengers … a bit of banter. You can’t just drive like a robot and not say anything.” Almost everyone on Talbot’s route, the 94 from Birmingham to Chelmsley Wood, knows him. “They say: ‘You’re my favourite driver … what’s up?’ Everyone says hello to me.”In 2017, Talbot qualified as a master bus driver, a title conferred by National Express on drivers with “an impeccable safety record and driving skills”. It was a proud achievement. “When you’re a master driver, you have to wear a white shirt and blue tie. People asked me about it, and I said: ‘As it says on the tin – master driver! I’m one of the best in the pack.’”I ask him why he has stayed in the same job for nearly three decades. “You have to be passionate about what you’re doing. I think that’s why I’m still here. If I weren’t, I’d have gone ages ago. This is the job for me. I just love talking to the passengers. I’m a people person.”And the best seat on the bus? “The driver’s seat,” Talbot laughs.After 43 years as a school meals supervisor, Barrett still turns up for work half an hour early every day to start making cakes by hand. Her favourite part of the day? Serving the children. “Especially when they come back and say: ‘Miss, can we have seconds?’ Your job feels worthwhile.”Why does Barrett love her job so much? “It’s the babies! They’re lovely,” she says. “It’s just like cooking for your family.” Barrett’s grandchildren, Charlie and Chanel, went to St Ursula’s – but she is adamant that she didn’t slip them any extra treats. “They didn’t get any special treatment.”When Barrett started, everything was prepared from scratch. They made meat puddings, mince-and-onion pie and toad-in-the-hole. The 90s marked the advent of processed food. But with Jamie Oliver’s healthy school dinners campaign in the 00s, the pendulum swung back. “We have gone back to how things were before,” Barrett says. “Fresh meat and fresh veg.” She welcomes it. “It’s a lot better for the children. Now, we hardly fry at all. Everything goes in the oven.” The one constant? Fish and chips on a Friday.Technology, however, has transformed the job. Once, Barrett was one of a team of 11 school meals supervisors. Now, she leads a team of four, who make 290 meals daily. Every morning, the children will choose from three meal options on an iPad in their classrooms and the orders will then come through to Barrett. “I like the technology,” she says. “I found it quite easy to adopt.”Barrett thinks she is a good employee because she never gave her bosses any trouble. “I go into work, do my job properly and help out where I can. If they needed me to cater functions now and again for visitors, I’d always say yes.”Being around children keeps her young, she thinks. “I should have retired, but I don’t want to. Please, God, I want to go on as long as I can. That’s how much I love it. I don’t get bored of it.”Barrett didn’t plan to spend her working life at the same school – things just turned out that way. “I never thought I would be here as long as this. I never gave it much of a thought. But since I loved working here, I never noticed being here for so long.”Cecilia Anim, 71, sexual and reproductive health specialist at the Margaret Pyke centre, LondonAnim moved to the UK from Ghana in 1973. It wasn’t always easy. “There weren’t many black people then,” Anim says. “There was a little bit of racism.” She trained as a nurse at Hull Royal Infirmary, where a patient once told Anim to “take my filthy black hands off her”. When she moved to the Margaret Pyke in 1979, patients would sometimes assume that Anim – the only black nurse – was a cleaner.Why is Anim still working full-time at the age of 71? “I love my job,” she says. “I came to women’s health with this vision of wanting to make things better for my patients.” She is also loyal to her employers because they supported her when her daughter Ruth, who has learning difficulties, was born in 1985. “After I had Ruth, and went back to work, my manager said: ‘Whatever you need to make this work, we will support you.’” She pauses. “That’s one of my favourite memories from my career.”Being in an organisation for all these years allows you to change things from within. “You learn about attitudes to employees, about workplace practices and how you can influence them.”Anim rose within the ranks of the Royal College of Nursing, becoming its first black president in 2015. “I’m still walking on air from that!” she laughs. “It’s a great achievement, not only for me but for the other BAME people behind me.” She was given a CBE in 2017, in recognition of her contribution to nursing.Anim is dismayed by the anti-immigration sentiment in the UK since the Brexit vote. “It’s created ision and resentment … the rhetoric saddens me. If it was like that in the 70s, maybe I’d have upped sticks and gone back home. And that would have been a great loss.”Does she have any plans to retire? “I will go when I’m ready. I’ve got the skills and, by the grace of God, I’ve got the strength and the energy. I still think there’s something I can contribute to healthcare.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9052c70af83976aa6cfb6e51c4e4036ac2ecbe48/0_15_1724_1034/master/1724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a069b208e3f2b643c611fdf6cb86c167","title":"brexit reduced to a petty squabble classic dom","story":"Johnson and Corbyn only cared about election timing – leaving this parliament to expire as it had lived. A laughing stockIt came down to a matter of days. Once Lindsay Hoyle, the deputy speaker, a man with both eyes on the top job had – as expected – chosen not to select amendments on EU citizens and votes for 16-year-olds, the only issue was about timing.The Tories wanted 12 December because that was the day they had first thought of and didn’t want to look like they were making any concessions. So tough. So brave. Classic Dom. Not wanting to be looking like the only leader too timid to vote for an election, Jeremy Corbyn muscled in on the Lib Dems and the SNP to insist that it took place on 9 December instead.Nine was the magic number. The only day that could possibly do. Partly because it would get darker three minutes later. But mainly because it wasn’t the date the Conservatives had picked. Too bad – 12 December it was. Brexit reduced to a petty squabble over something entirely trivial, because it was far too hard to consider the things that really mattered. This parliament was determined to expire as it had lived. A laughing stock.Proceedings had begun with Jacob Rees-Mogg putting forward a truncated programme motion to allow the government to pass its general election bill inside six hours. It was a simple matter, he said. For once he was almost telling the truth, as all the opposition parties had already indicated they would pretty much vote for whatever was put in front of them. Many MPs are now so Brexited out, they are incapable of rational thought. Rather, it’s become a race to be the last party to lose consciousness.Once Stella Creasy’s amendment to allow further amendments at the committee stage of the bill had been passed, it was over to Boris Johnson to open the debate. The Chronicle of a Death Foretold. The death in question being that of the entire UK, which was about to get six weeks of the same mediocrities telling the same lies and making the same unverifiable claims. The cruellest of punishments for a country hellbent on slipping out of the G7.In his dreams – those private moments he spends in front of the mirror, serenading the person he loves best – the prime minister is the master orator. The man with the golden voice who can charm all those with whom he comes in contact. The reality is that he struggles for coherence, his voice barking out subconscious pleas for help via morse code. A speaker who can just about scrape by as a feelgood after-dinner turn, recycling the same tired gags, but lacks the sincerity and concentration to survive sustained scrutiny. The only thing he really cares about is himself.Johnson had opened on auto-pilot. Labour had blocked Brexit by forcing him to have a massive sulk once MPs had insisted on having more than three days to debate his withdrawal agreement. The extension to the end of January would cost the UK an extra £1bn per month. Both statements blatantly untrue, but sure to be dragged out in every stump speech throughout the election campaign until enough people – possibly even Boris himself, if his lack of conscience allowed – came to accept as fact.As so often, Johnson then began to get bored with saying the same stuff he had said the day before and the day before that. So he just ad-libbed. The Commons chamber is really only an extension of the Oxford Union for him, with Tory backbenchers merely fawning acolytes. If anything, his contempt for his own MPs exceeds that for the opposition. There was no apology for breaking a commitment he had made to leave – “do or die” – by 31 October. Just a long moan about how difficult Brexit had become. It was the most passionate argument in favour of remain anyone was to make all day. Classic Dom.Corbyn had more than enough fantasies of his own. It was a complete lie that Labour had consistently resisted the chance to contest an election. The party had been gagging for one all along and it was only the absurd contortions of the Tories that had prevented one. Then he went into full stump mode. This wasn’t an election about Brexit. It was an election about public services and austerity. No one on the Labour front bench could quite bring themselves to break it to their leader that the entire reason the election was taking place was because of Brexit. The other stuff was nice and worth a mention but this was a Brexit election.Unbelievably, these opening speeches were pretty much the highpoint. Ian Blackford merely shrugged and said an election was a win-win for the SNP. If the Tories were defeated then all well and good but if they won then Scottish independence was one step closer. Bill Cash merely gave the edited highlights of all his speeches over the past 40 years. He won’t be missed. Not even by himself.“I’m going to carry on with my thoughts,” declared the Tory Vicky Ford to the astonishment of the five MPs left in the house. Because it hadn’t been obvious up till then that she had had any. One can only feel sorry for her constituents. Bob Seely wondered out loud why no one appeared to trust Boris before realising he had answered his own question. Because he’s Boris.The one standout moment was a passionate defence of futility from Labour’s Jess Phillips. The coming election would not answer any of the questions that had precipitated it. People would interpret the results to suit their own ends, she argued, and Brexit wouldn’t be resolved for years.All that was happening was that MPs had run out of ideas. An election was an admission of collective failure. Unable to resolve their differences, MPs had turned their sights on each other. A collective act of self-harm. We were heading for the Gunfight at the OK Corral. There would be blood. Many MPs wouldn’t be back in December. But everyone was banking on the fact it wouldn’t be them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab888ef15ed3297ac2c8e3ca116280a0d2ebf3d9/2_0_1735_1041/master/1735.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7aff44e5a333525416530f82013e21e","title":"can labour eat into projected 58 seat tory majority","story":"Boris Johnson opens election campaign with a 10-point poll lead We’re off, and Labour has it all to do. The Conservatives start the campaign with a 10-point poll lead, a margin that translates into an overall majority of about 58 for Boris Johnson, according to estimates produced by Electoral Calculus.If anything, the latest Brexit wrangling has benefited the Conservatives, extending the party’s lead by two points since 1 October, even as it became increasingly clear that Johnson’s “do or die” Halloween deadline would be missed.Certainly, the Conservative strategy for an election campaign looks simple enough – “let’s get Brexit done” – an appeal that plays to the idea that the nation is worn out by Westminster’s endless battles.That contrasts with the opposition’s argument, easy to portray as overly complex: vote Labour, negotiate a new deal and have referendum on the deal the party just negotiated. It is a promise of more Brexit debate and no certain final outcome.Labour’s best hope is to reset the agenda, if it can convince the electorate that Brexit is not so important. It worked in 2017, largely because voters thought the UK’s exit was a foregone conclusion, but will be harder this time around.In a campaign, the opposition knows it can draw on a suite of policies beyond where the Conservatives can go: renationalisation, free student education, tax increases for wealthy earners and perhaps on public spending, although here Johnson has tried to blunt the anti-austerity attack with pledges on schools spending and police numbers.Labour is way ahead among those aged 18 to 34, where student finance looms large, according to Ipsos Mori, although that is more than offset by a clear Conservative lead among the over 55s and a marginal lead among 35- to 54-year-olds. Pledges made to pensioners and older working age voters by both sides will be critical – particularly after the Tory disaster of the dementia tax in 2017.That would, however, amount to an 11 point gain from the Lib Dems’ dismal showing in 2017 and an extra 18 seats on an even swing. But, barring something unforeseen, it remains hard to see how they can win significantly more than 30 seats, up from 12 last time.For Johnson, margins are finer still. If the Tories lose all its 13 seats in Scotland to the Scottish National party – a distinct possibility given the polling there – it needs to gain 21 to get to an overall majority of 326. Other Tory seats in London and, to a lesser extent south-west England, could be at risk, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c027744a6f3e272e8cc19cc28120ab19ec9fd0cf/0_131_5183_3110/master/5183.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=199e6d52615d8266460def1db496815d","title":"how do i register to vote in the 12 december 2019 general election","story":"With MPs voting to call an election on 12 December, there’s still time to make sure your voice is heardTo vote in a UK general election you must:You also need to be on the electoral register.

The prime minister has promised to abide by existing standards to maintain “the level playing field” the EU requires to negotiate a free-trade agreement.Barnier said maintaining “fair” competition, rather than “wild” deregulation, was in the interests of the UK, and he warned that the EU-UK free-trade deal could be blocked by any one of three dozen national or regional parliaments. “Don’t underestimate the difficulties of the process of ratification,” he said, referring to the trade deal, but also other agreements the UK must negotiate in the coming years. “If it is not ratified, we return to zero.”Speaking in his first interview since being appointed one week ago to lead the EU’s taskforce on future relations with the UK, Barnier also said:Barnier was speaking shortly before parliament debated a snap December election that would deepen the uncertainty over Brexit.Brexit is scheduled for 31 January at the latest, leaving the UK just 11 months to negotiate a future relationship that covers trade, security, foreign policy and numerous technical topics, including transport and fisheries.Barnier said the EU would be ready to launch negotiations on the future “the day after” the withdrawal agreement was ratified. His team would prioritise trade and security among other topics, while some subjects would take more time. “We cannot do everything in 11 months, we will need more time,” he said.In a potentially helpful intervention for Johnson, Barnier said it would be possible to negotiate “the principle elements” of a free-trade agreement to avoid an economic cliff edge before the end of 2020.Barnier disagreed with suggestions that extending the transition period was inevitable, but said the UK would have to pay a “proportional” contribution to the EU budget to remain in the single market beyond 2020. The withdrawal agreement allows a one-off extension of either one or two years.Barnier said Brexit talks had taken longer than the EU expected, adding that “due to the British political situation we are obliged to be patient”.He now has a one-year, renewable mandate to oversee the EU’s future ties with the EU. European leaders were impatient to end “this negative negotiation of separation and orce and to open a new page on the future relations” he said. “And we are preparing for this. We are ready for this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3c1df5e2097e310bc8c55a4c6442b69c3c48303/0_89_4205_2524/master/4205.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa9646e309b4dfc5711ca4d89809d076","title":"tory mps asking brexit party not to stand against them","story":"Party chair receives ‘numerous’ requests not to risk splitting leave voteTory MPs are asking the Brexit party not to run candidates in their seats at an early general election, according to the party’s chair, Richard Tice, as speculation mounts over the anti-EU party’s potential pacts in leave areas.Tice said he received a frantic message from one Tory urging him not to stand a candidate in their constituency because they were facing a challenge from the Liberal Democrats. “It wasn’t the first it won’t be the last,” he said.The texter, who sent the message on Monday as MPs returned to Westminster amid early election speculation, said that as a committed Brexiter they should be spared a challenge from Nigel Farage’s Brexit party.Tice, a businessman who co-founded the Leave.EU campaign group, said he had already received numerous requests from Tory MPs who are clearly anxious that the Brexit party will have more appeal for their constituents than Boris Johnson’s Conservatives.The Brexit party is offering a “clean” break with the EU – in effect a no-deal arrangement. It has so far vetted 600 candidates for a general election and there is a presumption it is aiming to stand in all 650 seats. The party took 29 European parliament seats at the 2019 election and has four Welsh assembly seats.Farage is still offering the government an alliance or “non-aggression pact” as both parties want to quit the EU, there is concern that unless they stand aside for each other they might split the vote of Brexit-backing constituents and usher in an opposition party candidate who backs remain or a softer Brexit.The Brexit party wants a free shot at Labour heartland seats and in return it has offered not to run where a Tory MP is enthusiastically backing its brand of Brexit or where a Tory has a reasonable chance at beating a Labour rival.Without a genuine Brexit-backing majority in parliament, the stalemate in the Commons may continue, Farage has warned previously.However, his offer has been robustly dismissed by a No 10 source who said Farage was “not fit” to be allowed near government.The Brexit party is spending the next few days finalising seats for high-profile candidates such as Farage and Tice, who is an MEP for the East of England, and former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe.As it makes more concrete election plans, it appears it is attempting to align itself with the Democratic Unionist party to form a bloc that could eventually “hold the balance of power” that the Tories would need to unlock a functioning majority.DUP MP Ian Paisley Jr spoke at one of the Brexit party’s most recent rallies and they are said to have an extremely good relationship and to be working ever more closely together.The Brexit party is aiming for up to 50 seats, but even if it returns a low number of MPs, a party source said the DUP had been a case in point at how powerful a small collection of MPs could be in shaping Brexit. The source said: “We’ve seen how influential those 10 seats are.”There is an assumption that the DUP and Brexit party could unite with an offer for Johnson should he fall short of securing a majority in an election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7938781c558f20447f8c70b5f2c41c3f41624134/0_108_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7db8ae9c8826391353634907a49c3914","title":"uk general election confirmed for 12 december after brexit stalemate","story":"Boris Johnson wins vote to secure snap poll at fourth time of asking MPs voted on Tuesday night to finally resolve their Brexit deadlock by calling a general election, setting the stage for a 12 December contest that could be the most unpredictable in a generation.Boris Johnson won his fourth bid to go to the polls by 438 to 20 after Jeremy Corbyn declared that Labour would support an election as a “once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country”. The pre-Christmas vote will be the first December poll since 1923.The Liberal Democrats and Scottish National party abstained, after their preferred day for it to be held – 9 December – was rejected. Almost half of all Labour MPs were absent or voted against the legislation in a sign of unhappiness about a snap election, although some blamed a mix-up by the whips for their failure to attend.Parliament will dissolve next Wednesday for a short campaign of five weeks, so long as the House of Lords passes Johnson’s legislation as expected in the coming days.Corbyn set the stage for his campaign by calling on voters to kick out Johnson’s Conservatives who think they are “born to rule”, while Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, said it was “our best chance to elect a government to stop Brexit”.Speaking earlier in the House of Commons, Johnson argued that a “new and revitalised” parliament was needed to take Britain out of the European Union. “We are left with no choice but to go to the country to break free from this impasse,” he told MPs.But he later struck a cautious note, telling a backbench meeting of Tory MPs that it would be “a tough election but we will do the best we can”. He told them he had not wanted an election but was forced to seek one because Labour would have “sliced and diced” his Brexit legislation beyond recognition.In a move to unite his party, the prime minister decided to readmit 10 of the 21 MPs he expelled last month for defying his Brexit plan.The major battle lines of the campaign will be drawn along on the subject of Brexit, after Johnson failed to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October “do or die” as he had promised.The Conservatives will campaign to get Brexit done by pushing through Johnson’s deal, while Labour is promising a second referendum to let the people resolve the EU question.The Brexit party will try to outgun the Tories by arguing for a no-deal Brexit, while the Lib Dems will seek to attract remain voters from Labour by pledging to revoke article 50.Although parliament voted decisively for an election, many backbenchers in the two biggest parties are extremely nervous about going to the polls at such a politically volatile time and an unusual time of year. The Tories under Johnson are about 10 points ahead of Labour in the average polls, roughly half the lead that Theresa May had before she led her party to a disastrous result that saw her lose her majority.Labour has been deeply split for months about whether to back an election or a second referendum first. In a sign of reluctance on the backbenches, more than 100 Labour MPs abstained and 11 voted against the motion. Those rejecting an election included strongly pro-remain campaigners such as Margaret Beckett, Peter Kyle, David Lammy and Owen Smith, who later said he would be standing down.Speaking earlier in the Commons, Corbyn confirmed that the party would back a poll after rejecting one on three previous occasions, after getting confirmation that the EU had granted an extension to article 50.“I’m ready for it, we’re ready for it,” Corbyn said. “Because we want to be able to say to the people of this country there is an alternative to austerity. There is an alternative to inequality. There is an alternative to sweetheart trade deals with Donald Trump.”Polling experts have said the result is likely to be hard to gauge, with the British Election Survey suggesting a third of voters have switched parties in the last two elections.The Tories will be targeting leave-voting Labour marginal constituencies in Wales, the Midlands and the north of England, while defending areas of the south-west against the Lib Dems and its seats in Scotland against the SNP.Labour will be hoping to build on its successes in 2017 at picking up marginal seats from the Tories, especially in remain-voting urban areas. Corbyn’s campaign will also be bolstered by the leftwing activists in Momentum, who are planning to mobilise tens of thousands of people to knock on doors in marginal seats and launch a “viral video response unit” to reach millions online.The Lib Dems have been speaking to the Greens and Plaid Cymru about maximising the chances of pro-remain parties, by standing single “Stop Brexit” candidates in certain seats. However, the number of these is likely to be limited.Paula Surridge, a political sociologist at the University of Bristol, said the 12 December election was “likely to pose key challenges to both the Labour and Conservative parties, both of whom need to improve on their performance in terms of seats, while simultaneously unlikely to match their 2017 vote share”.“Who manages to hold on to the larger part of the 2017 votes is likely to form the next government. Will this be the Brexit election 2017 never quite managed to be?

However, it is still unclear whether a vote on the new Commons Speaker will be able to take place on Monday, as many MPs will be heading back to campaign immediately and are likely to be reluctant to return.The candidates for the job are split as to whether to press ahead, with Lindsay Hoyle, the favourite, and Meg Hillier, pushing for it to happen, while Chris Bryant, Harriet Harman, Rosie Winterton and Eleanor Laing, would prefer a new parliament to decide.

This would involve the three parties standing down for each other and, in some places, not standing against strongly remain Labour candidates.Sources said a formal announcement was expected in the coming days, probably next week. One party source said there had been a meeting several weeks ago, but none more recently. “I imagine a general election will concentrate people’s minds and the process will now move fairly quickly,” they said.One complication is that decisions have to be agreed by local activists. The three parties involved are notably decentralised, with constituency parties having considerable autonomy. The source said: “The hope is that with such an uncertain election, and the tight timetable, we can get people to agree more willingly.”The 2017 plan ran into problems, mainly because of a perceived unwillingness of parties to give ground, especially Labour. The Greens subsequently expressed scepticism about taking part in a similar process again.But a Green spokeswoman said the party was committed to the process now: “It is right that political parties engage in grown-up discussions about how to best stop a deeply damaging Brexit. Our party is in talks about the potential to stand a single remain-supporting candidate in some seats in England and Wales, as was successfully done in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. No decisions have yet been made and any agreement will involve the relevant local parties.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce8966c127a79390328f092c4a1a5a47a75565b7/0_105_5068_3041/master/5068.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeff1cbb93ab406d079e98fdd191e8c2","title":"have you experienced weekend loneliness share your experiences","story":"If you’re single and struggle with weekend loneliness, we’d like to hear from you We’d like to understand more about whether weekend loneliness is on the rise among single people and especially in big cities where it can be harder to feel a sense of community.

And when she saw firsthand the positive impact her performance had on terminally ill people, a simple question began to burn away inside her: why?It is a question that nearly 40 years later, medical researchers are starting to ask – thanks in part to Bull herself, now a life peer – and one that has the power to revolutionise healthcare in this country. But back in the early 1980s, when Bull was a young, inexperienced dancer, the idea that art could help to heal the nation’s health problems was not deemed worthy of serious academic study.This puzzled Bull, who saw dramatic transformations take place before her own eyes after she joined the Royal Ballet. “I was made aware of a project led by the education department to take pairs of dancers into hospitals and hospices to perform for the patients,” she explains. At the time, it merely felt like an opportunity to grab the limelight. “Here was a chance to do the repertoire I was dreaming of: the star roles.”Bull, now 56, has never forgotten the chat she had with an elderly female patient after one such performance in a hospice. “She talked about my costume and my headdress, what it felt like to wear it and what it felt like to dance.” At the time, Bull thought nothing of their conversation.“But as I left, the ward sister said: ‘Thank you so much for doing that. That’s the first time she’s spoken since she arrived here.’”Bull felt immediately that something fundamental had happened – not only to the patient, but to Bull herself. That was the moment, she says, that she realised just how powerful the arts could be. “It was the very beginning, for me, of thinking: this art that I have been passionate about since the age of seven has the potential to really make a difference.”Today, as vice-principal of King’s College London, Bull is the executive sponsor of the world’s largest-ever study of the impact of arts intervention on physical and mental health. The project, funded by a £2m grant from the Wellcome Foundation, will study three interventions: movement and music sessions for stroke patients, singing for women with postnatal depression, and dance for people with Parkinson’s disease.About 300 stroke patients will be recruited to see whether attending movement, music, song and spoken word workshops improves cognition, mobility and speech. Researchers will also measure the oxytocin and cortisol levels of 400 mothers to monitor the impact of singing on the mother’s body. And 135 Parkinson’s patients will be assessed to see if weekly ballet classes improve their mobility, stability and tremors. Of the Parkinson’s patients, she says. “It’s about the ability to control one’s own body, but it also has a wellbeing and mental health component.”It will form part of treatment pathways at Guy’s and St Thomas’, King’s College hospital and South London and Maudsley NHS foundation trusts, and community centres in Lambeth and Southwark. Carmine Pariante, professor of biological psychiatry at King’s, and Daisy Fancourt, associate professor of psychobiology and epidemiology at University College London, will lead the study. “We know these interventions can work – now we need to know whether they work for the NHS and in the NHS,” says Pariante.For Bull, who spent decades observing what was happening to people’s health when she danced for them, the research project represents a huge leap forward. “In my time in the company, we took part in lots and lots of these interventions. Sometimes in schools, sometimes in health settings. All the time I was getting this feeling: the art I do can make a difference. I could see people were altered, that they felt better about themselves, that they behaved differently. And I really wanted to understand why. But there were no researchers there.”One of the reasons she says she left her previous role as creative director of the Royal Opera House and came to King’s was so she could get closer to academics studying the changes she had witnessed as a dancer. Shortly after joining the university in 2012, she led “a mission”, she says, to find peer-reviewed, “proper research” around the globe about the impact of arts and culture on health and wellbeing, as well as other environmental, social and educational impacts.Each piece of research was given a 300-word layman’s summary by a team of academics and put on a free site, with a link to its original paper.It soon became obvious that the biggest sector of research by far was arts, health and wellbeing – and also that “there is a lot of research going on, but most of it is on a very small scale”, according to Bull.Some of the interventions detailed in the papers had even been robustly trialled, but never rolled out at scale: “The sector was crying out for the potential to test at the next level.” This was the impetus for the new, large study. “Through King’s health partners, we have the potential to take these three interventions and roll them out to bigger populations, and test whether they are clinically effective, economically effective and implementable,” she says.Throughout her career, she says she noticed that “when people engaged, not just in something that was good for them, but in something that they enjoyed, they were much more likely to change their behaviours.”She welcomes the move by the government to promote “social prescribing” as a recognition of the benefits of the arts in transforming patients’ lives.“I do think we’re seeing a shift. There is a move towards social prescribing, and arts interventions would be an element of that,” she says, citing the fact that these social and physical activities bring psychological and physical benefits to patients.Bull believes the project could have wider applications. “It’s about partnership. The world’s greatest challenges are not going to be solved by working in isolation. They are going to be solved by working imaginatively across institutions and disciplines and between partners like the English National Ballet and Parkinson’s researchers.”For Bull, it has been a tremendous journey. “I’m not a researcher myself, nor will I ever be. But I want to be in an environment where I can be closer to these questions.” She puts her faith in the research. “But from my own experience, I have had great joy and found great strength in dancing, singing and the arts. So I very much hope this is what we will find. And I wait with excitement to find out.”Family: Lives with her partner.Education: Royal Ballet School from the age of 11 until 18.Career: 2012-present: vice president and vice principal, King’s College London, and senior advisory fellow for culture 2001-2012: creative director, Royal Opera House 1981-2001: dancer, Royal Ballet.Awards: CBE 1999.

Instead she claimed Freeman had got the testosterone at the request of Shane Sutton, who at the time was the head coach of Team Sky and British Cycling. In his witness statement, Sutton denied knowledge of the delivery and denied the testosterone was intended for him.Freeman, who worked for Team Sky and British Cycling between 2009 and 2017 before resigning, is also expected to accept he made false statements and that he failed to keep proper medical records. Some of those were on a laptop containing, among other things, details of the contents of the mystery “Jiffy bag” delivered from British Cycling’s headquarters in Manchester to the Team Sky bus at the 2011 Critérium du Dauphiné. The lap-top was stolen in August 2014 and the contents had not been backed up.O’Rourke conceded that her client had “told a lot of lies” in previous statements to the GMC, which has brought the case against him, and UK Anti-Doping.Quoting Freeman, who was sitting alongside her at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing in Manchester, she added: “I couldn’t bring myself to tell the truth, even to my lawyers. I am here now and this is the truth.”Freeman faces losing his doctor’s licence if the tribunal finds against him in a case that was postponed in February because of his ill health. While Freeman now accepts many of the charges against him, O’Rourke denied his motive was to acquire testosterone for a rider to improve performance. “The GMC aren’t going to believe whatever he says, they are bent on saying it was doping,” she said.O’Rourke added the only GMC witness she required to cross-examine was Sutton, who was also the personal coach to the 2012 Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins. The GMC will call on an expert endocrinologist and will say that Sutton had no medical problem that needed Testogel and to prescribe it would have been “inappropriate”.Simon Jackson QC, for the GMC, also urged the panel to look at the history of what had been said by Freeman before the submission of his statement in September to highlight what it deems to be inconsistencies.The tribunal accepted Freeman could be shielded from the press while giving evidence – and also screened from Sutton, if he appears in front of the tribunal. O’Rourke also took exception to a proposed GMC amendment to the charges from suggesting Freeman’s motive was to supply the Testogel to an athlete to saying Freeman knew or ought to have known this was a possibility.But Jackson said the burden of proof had not changed and the amendment reflected updates from Freeman.Jackson also took exception to O’Rourke’s description of her client as a “jobbing GP” – pointing out Freeman had worked in senior jobs in football and cycling. “He is on the GMC register as a specialist in sports medicine before he started at British Cycling and Team Sky he had been at Bolton Wanderers as a doctor to the youth academy, and in that role he had a specific brief to deal with anti-doping.”A GMC investigation originally drew up 22 allegations against Freeman, including ordering testosterone, administering testosterone, making false statements and asking the supplier to support his assertions the drug was delivered in error. Freeman is now contesting only three of the charges.The tribunal is in camera making its decision on the GMC’s application to amend the allegation. It is due to reconvene on Tuesday 5 November and is scheduled to run until 20 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6a2bc40560b32d04f6224203e4097270cc54a89/0_141_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b37917a4959478c1bbd100479932a11","title":"lisa keightley appointed as new england women cricket coach","story":"Former Australia international Lisa Keightley has been named as the first full-time female head coach of England Women.The 48-year-old, who was the first woman to score a century at Lord’s, will take up her new post in January at the end of the Women’s Big Bash League, in which she coaches the Perth Scorchers. It is a return to England for Keightley, who will be a familiar face to several players having worked as head coach of the England Women’s academy between 2011 and 2015. “I’m massively excited,” Keightley said. “It’s a huge opportunity. It’s a team full of world-class players and to be given the chance to work with some of the players who I worked with a few years ago is really exciting. I can’t wait to get started and see where we can get to. “England are the current 50-over world champions and they made it to the final of the last ICC Women’s T20 World Cup. They’re a very competitive side and they wouldn’t be in big matches like that if they didn’t have a really strong group of players who can perform on the big stage. I’m really looking forward to getting under way and helping the team progress.” Clare Connor, the England and Wales Cricket Board’s managing director of women’s cricket, said Keightley was the stand-out candidate for the job. “She outlined clear plans as to how she believes she can take the team and this group of players forward,” Connor said. “Lisa will become the first full-time female head coach of the England Women’s team. I am excited about the progress our sport continues to make and I’m sure that Lisa’s appointment will rightly be seen as another huge step for women’s cricket.”Alastair Maiden will remain in interim charge until Keightley’s duties with the Scorchers are complete.

Now he’s preparing for his West End debut – in the lead role Sam Tutty was a fan of the Broadway hit Dear Evan Hansen before he had even seen it. “I listened to the entire soundtrack when it came out and loved it,” the 21-year-old remembers. “Then, when I was in my first year of drama school, we did a summer show and I sang Waving Through a Window.”Indeed, a quick YouTube search pulls up a video of Tutty putting his all into the show’s trademark number about its titular teen who is “on the outside, always looking in”. One commenter reckoned he was the “future Evan Hansen”. It was a prophetic thought, as Tutty is now playing the lead in the much-anticipated transfer of the show to London, having been through a glut of auditions, even flying to the US for the final round.“Good lord,” says Tutty when I tell him someone on a fan forum guessed the entire cast a week before it was announced. Director Michael Greif, who has been involved with the show since its original incarnation in Washington DC in 2015, laughs, before adding in heavy Brooklyn tones: “Yes, but you still sang the song illegally!”Tutty, smiley and thoughtful with side-slicked strawberry blond hair, describes his dressing room as “a bit big”. He’d better get used to it, since he’s about to become one of the West End’s shiniest new stars. Tickets for Dear Evan Hansen are swiftly selling out, the show having already been a smash on Broadway, where it has scooped Tonys and Grammys since opening in 2016.The story of Evan – who tells a white lie about classmate Connor Murphy that quickly builds to a full-scale deception – also launched the career of Ben Platt, recently seen in Ryan Murphy’s The Politician on Netflix. While it tackles difficult themes (anxiety, bullying, suicide) there’s a lightness of touch and, of course, lively songs. “It’s pretty sophisticated in the way it seduces you,” Greif says. “There’s a lot of humour – then it takes you some place else.”As Evan, Tutty has had to get into the mind of a character who struggles to communicate with the people around him, eventually writing motivational letters to himself beginning with the three words that give the show its title. “Evan’s brain is racing all the time,” says Greif. “A lot of his anxiety is based on the fact he’s constantly second-guessing. So I’ve been getting Sam to consider the worst possible option all the time.”As well as intensive rehearsals in New York alongside the show’s creators, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, Tutty drew on his own school days (he grew up in Sussex, later relocating to Hull) for the playground dynamics. “I certainly found myself in situations where things snowballed and got out of control. I think that’s such a relatable thing for everyone.”The actor has previously spoken about how he identified with Evan, who is raised by his mother (Tutty’s own father left at a similar age). The show’s class politics resonated too: Greif describes the two clans, the Hansens and the Murphys, as “struggling” and “very affluent” respectively. “I know people whose families were from a higher class,” says Tutty, “but they still went to the same school because their parents felt like it was a civic duty. And because this show is so wonderfully written, you don’t go, ‘Why are these people all at the same school?’”Evan might sound like a tough character to play, especially for a first-time West End performer, but Tutty has found it a joy. Among his highlights is Sincerely, Me – a moment of levity in the first act, memorable for its sarcastic lyrics about teenage drug use and rubbing one’s nipples and “moaning with delight”. Besides, he says, “there’s a beautiful scene where Connor says to Evan, ‘Now we can pretend we both have friends.’ Within that moment, Evan realises he does want friends, he isn’t just looking to hurt people.”As Tutty proudly shows off his Evan wardrobe of identikit polo shirts and the plaster cast – a heavy one he has to wear on his arm – Greif says: “What I’m really hoping is that we erase the line between people who see plays and people who see musicals. This is a show with all of the emotion and celebration musicals have, but it also has a sophisticated, credible plot. You don’t have to check your intelligence at the door.”• Dear Evan Hansen is at Noël Coward theatre, London, until 4 April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8402bb961cccd87a228d1918846d878eac9ed3f9/0_480_2140_1284/master/2140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1488d8bece814087164799bb43e31ad","title":"how smart tech can put us on track to sustainable travel","story":"People are willing to change their travel habits for the good of the environment. From travel apps and carbon calculators to free public transport, here’s how you can make a differenceIndustry experts believe that a nationwide transport revolution is required to mitigate the climate crisis, and that smart technology could transform the way we travel. Travel apps are making sustainable transport options more accessible to the growing number of people keen to change their travel plans to reduce their environmental impact.Tools include the calculator at EcoPassenger, which directly compares energy consumption and carbon emissions of planes, cars and trains for any journey. Meanwhile, Lime’s new electric bike and scooter sharing scheme is taking off in London and Milton Keynes, and Europe’s leading train and coach app, Trainline, is making greener travel more hassle-free for customers globally by investing in technology to help make train and coach travel across 45 countries more accessible. “Our long-term vision is to enable everyone to travel from A to B much faster and more efficiently, in a way that’s better for the environment,” says Clare Gilmartin, CEO of Trainline. “We use artificial intelligence and advanced mobile technology so that, via our app, customers can travel by train and coach seamlessly, with on-the-go access to real-time journey information, using digital tickets to skip queues and with access to clever features like BusyBot, which harnesses crowdsourced data to help people find a seat on a busy train. We believe smart tech has a crucial role to play in encouraging and enabling people to travel sustainably.”The government has invested £1.5bn in grants between 2015 and 2020 for electric plug-in vehicles and schemes to kickstart the rollout of charge-point infrastructure, while pledging that all new cars and vans should be zero-emission by 2040, according to its Road to Zero strategy. Childs insists this is not enough: “The only way we can make the scale of reductions we need fast enough is by having a revolution in transportation.”Lisbon has one of the world’s largest electric vehicle charging point networks, while Estonia and Luxembourg have introduced countrywide free public transport. “Free public transport is transformational, not only for the environment – it’s also socially progressive,” adds Childs. Trainline found that a quarter of young Brits would reduce time behind the wheel to be more sustainable, and Friends of the Earth is calling for the government to make bus travel free to under-30s to reduce the need for young people to buy cars and help people switch to public transport.By driving positive change through technology, travel apps help create a more sustainable and efficient transport infrastructure, enabling a smoother transition to lower carbon-impact travel, within the UK and beyond.Book travel in and across 45 countries today with Trainline, Europe’s leading train and coach app"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58c0f14c375f014dbb2e32b4cec28918b11daf77/227_320_4836_2902/master/4836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeeecb8be7305c2efcd9f68dd033bfb7","title":"rail adventures five scenic european journeys to savour","story":"With train travel often more sustainable than driving or flying, now’s the time to leave the car at home.

It was a huge engineering achievement and set the standard for mountain railways, for which it has been declared a world heritage site. Take a seat on the left side of the train by preference. The views are superb as you cross the 895-metre (2,900 ft) Semmering Pass, the highlight of the journey. You can extend your trip via Villach to reach Venice: travelling from central to southern Europe in one exhilarating journey.To get to Vienna: take the Eurostar and change at Brussels and Frankfurt.Typical journey time: Vienna to Klagenfurt, 3 hours 55 minutes direct.Leeds to Carlisle via SettleIt has been described as the line that should never have been built, being a technical challenge that was financially ruinous and costly in the lives of navvies. When it was threatened with closure in the 1980s, the Settle-Carlisle line was rediscovered by train lovers, day-trippers and hill walkers and given a second life. Leaving industrial West Yorkshire, climb into the Yorkshire Dales national park via the Ribblehead viaduct to reach the highest mainline station in England, Dent, at an altitude of 350 metres (1,150 ft). Great views of the austere Pennines are guaranteed.Getting to Leeds: there are plenty of high-speed mainline trains from London.Typical journey time: Leeds to Carlisle, 2 hours 40 minutes direct.Cologne to MainzFancy a river cruise through the Rhine Gorge – only, by train? There are railway lines on both banks of the river, giving splendid views of the gorge, which stretches for 40 miles between Koblenz and Bingen. The east bank line is more scenic, but not as well-serviced as the western side, which has a wider choice of trains – so take the west-bank mainline through Bonn. Or, if you don’t mind taking a slightly more circuitous route, you could go down one and back up the other. Either way, en route are innumerable magnificent castles – whether real, mock or ruined – and pretty villages with half-timbered houses.To get to Cologne: take the Eurostar from London St Pancras and change at Brussels.Typical journey time: Cologne to Mainz, 1 hour 40 minutes.Journey times and ticket prices vary according to which particular options you choose.Ticket to rideIt is easy to book the train for your next adventure.

Do not read on if you have not watched the final.It was the twice-baked Stilton souffles that started the decline. Failing to rise to the occasion, and collapsing in a soggy heap, was Steph’s fate – the soufflés did the same. Going into the final of The Great British Bake Off (Channel 4), she – the four-time star baker – was the one to beat. Watching the prize slip from her floured hands, crestfallen under her fringe, was heartbreaking to watch. Even Paul Hollywood couldn’t bear it. “It doesn’t matter, alright?” he said, comforting her after the only thing her showstopper stopped was her Bake Off-winning dreams. Of course it doesn’t matter. But it also sort of does: this is the Great British Bake Off, cultural institution, a pick-me-up for troubled times, comfort food for the nation.Except this hasn’t been my favourite Bake Off year – a splash of vinegar has been added to the recipe. It wasn’t thrillingly dramatic to watch Steph come undone, it was uncomfortable, and the natural endpoint of a show that has become overly technical and stressful. Joy has not been liberally sprinkled, at least not since the jolly goth Helena – she of the octopus custard pie – was thrown out in a mean double eviction in week five. The judges’ comments have become more withering, and the skits between presenters Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig more forced (please, no more jokes about the diminutive Toksvig hiding in a sack). The showstopper this week suddenly seemed well chosen: the bakers had to create food that, deceptively, looked like something else. I fear the show may be going the same way – all the pastel-coloured, crème pat-making elements are there on the outside, but inside there’s a hint of curdling.The three bakers left – David, Alice and Steph – did deserve their places. David is so trim, I suspect he never eats the cake he makes. Neither, by all appearances, does his partner Nik. Having got to know the bakers over the past nine weeks, there is something really touching about seeing snippets of their home lives. Steph’s mum hints at a tough time for her. There are videos of Alice baking as a child. Her parents, Jane and Henry, say they have always taught her the value of “good management”. It is advice more suited to an appraisal than child-rearing, but I am going to remember it.The first challenge is – thankfully, simply – a chocolate cake. David does a good mirror glaze but – has he learned nothing during his time in the tent? – his Armagnac flavour is too much. Alice’s looks a mess. “Maybe it will taste nice?” she says uncertainly. Steph’s black forest gateau is “a very nice cake”, even though Prue Leith says it is “very 70s”, as if this is a bad thing.There is a surreal moment when Paul and Prue pretend to freeze and fail to leave the tent before the start of the technical challenge. It is deeply weird, but also quite funny. The bakers have to make six stilton souffles their faces drop. Toksvig is astonished at Alice’s limited life experience: “You’ve never made a roux?” she asks, incredulous. Steph is struggling – she doesn’t know a bain-marie needs hot water and her souffles are a puddle. The tears start, and then don’t really stop: “I just feel a bit stupid,” she says. “It’s like eating a sauce,” says Prue.Then it is showstopper day but – disaster! – Alice’s parents may not make it, as their flight from Dublin has been cancelled. More tears: “I couldn’t imagine it without them.” (She doesn’t, however, mutter anything about “good management.”)They have to make a “picnic” of baked treats made to look like something else, using airbrushing and paintbrushes. David is making wedges of lemon pound cake that look like cheese, Alice is doing a carrot cake “pork pie” and Steph is making a lemon poppyseed cake in the shape of a chicken burger, but the cake has stuck to the tin. Her macarons are not going well, either. “I don’t know how I can get through it.” What little confidence she had before has now deserted her. Alice’s creation is “exceptional” but David’s cheeseboard collection is not only that but “stunning”, too. He is the worthy winner. There is always something redeeming about the triumph of the underdog – and his little bread rolls, made to look like peaches, were amazing.I hope the producers manage to find the warmth again. Nothing big, just a recipe tweak – and a plea, too, to drop the cringeworthy “Hollywood handshake”. I wouldn’t dump Bake Off in the bin just yet – this is no ruined baked alaska moment. Maybe, like poor Steph, it’s just having an off day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be2305f29d6cd26bce087fbafd2c6cef5c578fb0/0_236_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62bb2dc33242dafb8b42573bcb011a62","title":"army officer alexander vindman impeachment testimony republicans quandary","story":"Lt Col Vindman reportedly said omissions included references to Joe Biden and BurismaA decorated army officer and the top Ukraine expert on the national security council has reportedly told House impeachment investigators that the White House transcript of a call between the presidents of the US and Ukraine left out important words and phrases.The New York Times cited three sources familiar with Alexander Vindman’s testimony on Tuesday who said the omissions included Donald Trump making reference to recordings of the former vice-president Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelenskiy making reference to Burisma, the company for which Biden’s son Hunter worked.Lt Col Vindman tried to edit the White House reconstruction of the call to correct the omissions, but some of his edits were not incorporated into the transcript, according to the report.The arrival of Vindman tipped Republicans into a spiral of internal conflict over how far to go – and what lines were unacceptable to cross – in defending the US president.Vindman appeared on Capitol Hill wearing his US army dress uniform, which bore a combat infantry badge and a Purple Heart medal, bestowed when he was wounded by an improvised explosive device in Iraq.Like prior testimony in the month-old impeachment process, Vindman’s opening statement, published the night before, had the potential to be extraordinarily damaging for Trump.A top Ukraine expert, Vindman, 44, described his alarm at witnessing Trump and others attempting to force Ukraine into a charade designed to harm Trump’s political rival Joe Biden and sow doubts about Russian tampering in the 2016 US election.That alleged conduct is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, which could result in charges against Trump of abuse of power and other offenses.“I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the US government’s support of Ukraine,” Vindman testified.Top Democrats later said his testimony was “extremely disturbing” and called him “very credible”.Trump’s defenders zeroed in on the fact that Vindman was born in Ukraine, having left the Soviet Union in the 1970s with his family when he was three – a story celebrated in news reports at the time as a quintessential tale of American promise.After joining the army, serving in multiple overseas deployments, and earning a master’s degree from Harvard in Russian, Eastern Europe and Central Asian studies, Vindman worked for the White House.But that did not protect him from attack on Tuesday by Trump, who expressed outrage on learning that Vindman was one of the aides who listened to a July call Trump held with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.Vindman was the first White House official to provide direct testimony on the contents of the 25 July call, which to this point have not been disputed by any party in the impeachment inquiry, including the White House, which last month released a summary of the call.“Why are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call?” Trump tweeted. He then accused Vindman of being a “Never Trumper”, or a dyed-in-the-wool Trump critic, but the claim was quickly debunked in multiple reports.That did not stop Trump’s defenders in the media from attacking Vindman as disloyal.“Here we have a US national security official who is advising Ukraine, while working inside the White House, apparently against the president’s interest, and usually, they spoke in English,” said Fox News host Laura Ingraham. “Isn’t that kind of an interesting angle on this story?”Her guest, John Yoo, a former George W Bush administration lawyer infamous for drafting a framework for torture, agreed. “You know, some people might call that espionage,” Yoo said.But the backlash in the Republican ranks, rare where Trump is involved, was unusually harsh.“That guy’s a Purple Heart. I think it would be a mistake to attack his credibility,” John Thune, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, told Politico. “You can obviously take issue with the substance and there are different interpretations about all that stuff. But I wouldn’t go after him personally. He’s a patriot.”Congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the daughter of former vice-presidentDick Cheney, and a member of the House Republican leadership, echoed Thune in a press conference.“We need to show that we are better than that as a nation,” said Cheney. “We’re talking about decorated veterans who have served this nation, who put their lives on the line. And it is shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this nation, and we should not be involved in this process.”As news of Vindman’s testimony leaked, it emerged that he had kept his own set of notes about the 25 July call between Trump and Zelenskiy, in which Trump asked for a “favor” and repeatedly brought up Biden, a leading Democratic candidate in the 2020 election. Vindman’s remarks were “extremely, extremely, extremely disturbing”, the acting House oversight committee chair, Carolyn Maloney, later told NBC News.Pressure on Trump is mounting rapidly. House speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would vote Thursday on a resolution to move the proceedings out of closed-door depositions and into open hearings. On Tuesday afternoon, the text of the resolution to be voted on was made public, noting that the House intelligence committee would lead planning of the public hearings.The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a prominent Trump defender, has called the House proceedings a “sham”.But with each witness, Trump’s defense has weakened. He insists he was only interested in rooting out corruption in Ukraine, denied a political motive for seeking investigations of Biden, denied that military aid for Ukraine was withheld for inappropriate leverage, and denied that any of his conduct was untoward.The only defense left on Tuesday was to attack the messenger. But the attacks appear to have bounced off the medals on Vindman’s chest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03dfdd9c4f422ef04e885d7203eab23a24831e0d/47_349_4769_2862/master/4769.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4303173e722daef2061ee407904af82b","title":"paris urban shepherd photo essay","story":"Julie-Lou Dubreuilh has been a shepherd for three years in Paris and its suburbs, and founded the Clinamen collective in the city. The photographer Abdulmonam Eassa spotted her flock in the French capital and went to her village to meet herJulie-Lou Dubreuilh, 41, is of French origin and works as a shepherd in Paris and its suburbs. She joined a group of urban shepherds and then moved to the suburbs and founded the Clinamen collective.“We go to the border of Paris twice a month, to graze in the course. On a daily basis, the herd grazes an immense 400-hectare park in La Courneuve. And five days a month, they eat in the city on circuits of 9-15km, in an urban area north of Paris that extends from Aubervilliers to Garges-lès-Gonesse.”Dubreuil studied architectural engineering, as her father did, in her hometown of Bordeaux, but she did not finish her studies because of their difficult financial situation at the time. Dubreuil got a job as a field manager, building and renovating homes, and was the only woman in that line of work where she was living.“All our trips are under the control of the authorities. The goal is gradually to make room for the animal – whether wild or domestic – in the urban space.”She said she was not willing to continue with the field manager role after a few difficult experiences and had dreamed of finding something better.The idea of being a shepherd came to her mind while she was watching a herd of sheep. Dubreuilh said she felt like she was facing a closed door and the sheep were telling her to open it.Dubreuilh humbly describes her seven years of being a shepherd, saying: “It was the sheep who taught me how to be a shepherd.” Those willing to learn must keep their eyes open “for the signs the animals communicate to you”.She added: “Many women are very shy, and I tell people there are thousands of women who are working in every sector, but they do not appreciate our capabilities as women. As always. I thought to myself, ‘Paris would appear quite pretty with sheep’.“Once, I was sad when I passed by an area under a bridge in Paris where migrants had set up camp. Usually, the sight of sheep in the streets brings a smile to people I pass by, but it did not happen with them. I thought happiness could at least pass momentarily through their minds when they see the sheep, but unfortunately it didn’t happen. I was very sad after, I kept wondering what life on this Earth did to them.”Dubreuilh continued: “Generally, people are happy and especially children, because for most of them, it’s their first time in life to see real sheep. We occasionally pass by a group of snobbish people, who look down on us. However, I feel quite comfortable with my sheep in such fancy places – that is my little revenge against capitalism.”She comes to the city twice a month with her herd, and spends the rest of the time in her village in the countryside."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/203c6bdaa8ce6a76114b63644b319f3f618c2dbf/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f09d04d49813bf45e0e4909c8668d6d","title":"russia backed syria constitution talks begin in geneva","story":"150-strong committee meets to chart political settlement and negotiate end to civil warRussia will underscore its role in the political future of Syria as the 150-strong Syrian constitutional committee meets for the first time under UN auspices to chart a political settlement to end the eight-and-a-half-year civil war.The meeting – a key proposal from Moscow – in Geneva is being overseen by the UN special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, but has been fraught with difficulties, ranging from last-minute hiccups over the committee’s composition, wrangles over the opening ceremony and, crucially, fresh fighting in north-east Syria between the Syrian army and Turkish-backed troops.Foreign ministers from Russia, Iran and Turkey were due in Geneva on Tuesday night to meet negotiators, even though Pedersen had asked all countries to stay away and leave the talks as an exclusively “Syrian owned, Syrian led process”.The aim of the meeting is to agree a new constitution for Syria, but it is unclear if this will mean redrafting the existing constitution, written in 2012, or starting from scratch.No deadline has been set for the end of talks, but Pedersen has said all sides had promised to work expeditiously.Previous Syria peace talks in Geneva foundered on a Russian unwillingness to press the negotiating team of President Bashar al-Assad to engage, but the current process is a largely Russian construct, and the most senior Russian diplomat on Syria, Alexander Lavrentiev, has been preparing the ground.Donald Trump, by suddenly redeploying US troops out of north-east Syria, has reduced the little remaining leverage that Washington possessed at the talks.Russia first proposed a 150-strong committee in January 2018 at a meeting in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, and the idea was implicitly seen as Moscow’s alternative to the UN’s brokerage.The committee has 50 Syrian government delegates loyal to the Syrian president, 50 members of the Syrian opposition largely supported by Turkey and Saudi Arabia, and a 50 civilian representatives. Disputes between the regional powers over the composition of the civilian group, some still unresolved, held up the committee being announced until September.The weakened opposition team is a coalition of at least five different platforms and has nominated Hadi Bahra as co-chair for the committee. Bahra said his side had already prepared a draft constitution, adding that he believed the negotiations need not last longer than two to six months.A smaller tripartite 45-strong committee is due to undertake the detailed drafting of the constitution.Although seven Kurds are on the committee, the political wing of the mainly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces in north-east Syria has been excluded. The Kurdish Syrian autonomous administration objected to the exclusion on Monday.Istanbul regards the Kurdish YPD as the political wing of the “terrorist” PKK, and is driving their forces from the border with Turkey.Deserted by their former allies the US, the YPD has been forced to start Russian-brokered talks to form a military deal with Assad’s forces. Assad in the past has opposed a federated Syria with an semi-autonomous Kurdish province.Assad’s foreign minister, Walid al-Muallem, has already warned “the hostile Turkish incursion into north-east Syria seriously threatens the work of the constitutional committee”.There is intense pressure on the Syrian opposition to recognise the weakness of their position and scale back their demands. They have already complained the committee’s remit abandons previous vital commitments in UN resolutions to form a transitional governing body within six months, release detainees and provide information on missing persons.Pederson, like his predecessor, Staffan de Mistura, is searching for positives, pointing out that the committee – with terms of reference and core rules of procedure – marks the first political agreement between the overnment of Syria and the opposition.The committee also commits the government and the opposition and their nominees to sit together face-to-face in dialogue and negotiations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28dacc5d00d93a64ab25129c8b9358d2f3af5a85/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eed5174b5b30a6617af3be7fbc38e05e","title":"the women who broke the harvey weinstein story podcast","story":"When Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey began investigating Harvey Weinstein, they had no idea it would ignite a global reckoning on sexual harassment resulting in #MeToo.

However, those living at number 13 only got, on average, £260,716 when they sold up.Many developers for new builds have scrapped homes at No.13 from new housing estates, with only a £4,707 difference in price.A spokesman for Stone Real Estate said: With 13 supposedly an unlucky number, having a property tarnished with it has long been a reason for lower asking prices and has even seen some big housebuilders remove it completely from their new build developments.  Since 2016, transactions involving the number 13 have accounted for just 0.8 per cent of new build sales and just 1.1 per cent of existing property sales.While new build homes have done a better job of overcoming the stigma, the average sold price since 2016 for number 13 new builds is still two per cent lower than new build homes with other numbers.Around 10 per cent of people in the UK suffer from triskaidekaphobia, a fear of the number 13, which is thought to stretch back to biblical tradition where Judas was the thirteenth disciple.The superstition has continued across the world with many people avoiding seats numbered 13 on planes or coaches. Some airlines such as Ryanair have no row thirteen on their aircraft.Michael Stone, founder of Stone Real Estate, said: In this day and age, it\u0027s quite remarkable how ancient superstitions can still have such a detrimental impact on the price a property will sell for.For many, the aspiration to own their home will no doubt rise above any such feelings around the number 13 and the figures show that as a first-time buyer, it\u0027s probably the ideal number due to the lower cost of getting on the ladder.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Within three months of first going on sale in 2016, they’d become the number one wireless headphones in the world. Within a year, they became the number one headphones of any kind.Hopes are high for the new model.First of all, they’re not called AirPods 3, just because they’re the third iteration. Just as the iPhone 11 was accompanied by the iPhone 11 Pro, so the new headphones sit alongside the existing second-generation AirPods as the top-end part of the range.AirPods Pro have a completely new design, though they’re immediately recognisable as AirPods with the same gloss white finish and stem that points down towards your mouth. But that stem is noticeably shorter this time and has a more solid look to it.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Google celebrates its 21st birthday on September 27.

Although tales of AirPods falling out of ears were few – simply mislaying the tiny gadget was much more common – the new design feels comfortingly safe.The new AirPods are also water- and sweat-resistant. That doesn’t mean they can survive being submerged and you definitely shouldn’t swim in them. The Ingress Protection rating is IPX4 which means “Protected against water sprayed from all directions – limited ingress permitted”. In other words, great for working out or suitable for wearing in the rain.One big new part of the design is the silicone ear tip, meant to be the first way to create strong audio by ensuring there’s a decent seal to keep the outside world out and the music in.Typically, Apple has included its own way of ensuring the perfect fit. Three sets of silicone ear tips are included in the box. The medium ear tip is in place. Once you’ve put the AirPods Pro into your ears, the Ear Tip Fit Test on the iPhone awaits: music is played and the inward-facing microphone can tell if there’s a decent seal or not.If it decides there isn’t, the test advises you to adjust the AirPod or try a new ear tip. Apple has devised a clever system that keeps the silicone tips solidly in place while still making them easy to swap.The tight seal means the audio quality is already better than on previous AirPods but the big new feature on AirPods Pro is also audio-related: active noise cancellation.I’ve been trying this feature more or less continuously and I might as well tell you now, it’s fantastic.As with other active noise cancellation features, it works by using a microphone that listens to the world outside and creating a noise which is reversed in phase to cancel out the external noise.Some other in-ear headphones have this, such as the upcoming Huawei Freebuds 3 and the widely-and-justly applauded Sony WF-1000XM3.Apple’s noise cancellation is very skilfully done, and highly effective. Turning on noise cancellation in a crowded room is almost like watching a movie dream sequence where the voices of people around you smoothly but swiftly fade away.In some headphones, noise cancellation can affect the audio quality of the music you’re playing. I haven’t found that to be the case here.With regular AirPods, and these too, removing one bud from your ear pauses the music, and putting it back starts it up again. It’s the natural way to respond if someone comes to speak to you.That feature is here, too, but there’s also another way to hear the outside world. It’s called Transparency Mode and it means the music still plays but you can hear your voice and that of the person you’re talking to. In other words, it overcomes the noise-isolating seal to make your voice sound as it would if you weren’t wearing headphones.AirPods Pro will scan your ears to tell you if they fit correctlyBattery life on AirPods Pro is the same as on the previous version, that is five hours. Unless you have either noise-cancellation or Transparency turned on, which reduces the charge to four hours 30 minutes. There’s another 19 hours of charge in the case, again as before.Oh, and by the way, although this is a Pro model, it doesn’t mean there’s a USB-C connector on the charging case. Like previous AirPods and like the current iPhone 11 Pro, the AirPods Pro use a Lightning connector.What is different from previous AirPods is the cable that’s supplied - here it’s a Lightning to USB-C cable, not USB-A as previously.Because of the silicone ear tips, the mechanism for changing tracks used on previous AirPods – a vigorous tap on the AirPod stem – isn’t quite so comfortable.So, the stem on the AirPod Pro has a flat capacitive touch panel, called a force sensor which, when you press and hold it, switches between Noise-Cancelling and Transparency mode.\u0026nbsp I found the easiest way to activate this was to squeeze the AirPod stem from both sides.A shorter touch is used to pause tracks or answer calls, repeated touches change to next or previous songs. It’s a different interaction but easy to get used to.Although the new AirPods Pro buds are slightly heavier than before, they don’t feel it and the bigger case is still highly pocketable and light.The audio quality isn’t the only element with AirPods Pro, though it’s obviously the most important. When you pair any pair of wireless headphones with an iPhone, the set-up and usage is important. To pair the AirPods Pro you simply open the case next to your iPhone and it’s done. It makes using AirPods a seamless experience.AirPods Pro are more expensive than regular AirPods which cost £159, or £199 if you opt for the model with a wireless-chargeable case. So, there’s a £50 premium for AirPods Pro which cost £249. This is a higher price than rival noise-cancelling in-ears from Sony and Huawei.Is it worth the money? I’d say yes, just for the jaw-droppingly good audio you get with noise-cancelling turned on. Add in the smooth user experience, the excellent, comfortable fit and the cute design, and AirPods Pro become a compelling prospect.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And it smells pretty bad. An 18 per cent fall in pre-tax profits and a 3 per cent fall in revenues.

So has Ewen Stevenson. He’s the bank’s current finance director, but has only been with it since January having been hired from RBS. So he’d be a compromise, a sort of internalexternal hire. Coming from RBS, he’d know a thing or two about turbulence and restructuring.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspInevitably, people have been looking at JP Morgan, a bank that turns everyone connected with HSBC green with envy given how it has\u0026nbspzoomed past\u0026nbspand now seems to be on a completely different (and much faster) road.

It’s the clearest example of how rushed the show has become in recent years, as its unpredictability gives way to conventional plot. 273 72. Season four, episode three: Breaker of ChainsJaime appears to rape Cersei next to Joffrey’s corpse. The scene is confused, unpleasant and different from the books in confusing and unhelpful ways. The Sand Snakes are just unbearably naff and this is one of their worst.At Craster’s Keep, much rape and murder of children. Unpleasant. The opposite of the rushed plot of the later seasons, this is basically a leisurely chat up the M1. 673 68. Season eight, episode four: The Last of the StarksGiven a chance to return to real intrigue after the Battle of Winterfell, Benioff and Weiss showed they had lost their grip, with an incoherent episode that betrayed several key characters for the sake of obvious plot grinding. A Starbucks cup left on a feasting table told us everything we needed to know about a series that has given up.773 67. Season two, episode eight: Prince of WinterfellThere is some good stuff with Arya and Jaqen H’ghar, but it’s mainly placeholder as they set up the Battle of Blackwater. Jon Snow and Ygritte’s goodbye at the climax of season three ought to have been much sadder. 973 65. Season five, episode two: The House of Black and WhiteLots of setting up. Jaime and Bronn plan to go to Dorne, Arya arrives in Braavos. 1073 64. Season seven, episode six: Beyond the WallThis ought to have been one of the great battles: ice zombies plus dragons plus Jon Snow’s expedition. It looked spectacular, but everyone worried about teleporting ravens and speed of sound dragons. Some absolutely horrible banter between Grey Worm and Missandei.Pyat Pree kills the 13 in Qarth. Tywin talks to Arya about legacy.Melisandre is a very, very old woman. Lots of Tyrion talking in King’s Landing but not much else. The Hound meets Ian McShane. That’s about it in an episode full of preparations.A classic season opener that flits from place to place. 1773 57. Season two, episode four: Garden of BonesLots of grimness. Rat and bucket torture at Harrenhal. Robb Stark meets Talisa. Joffrey is cruel to Ros and Daisy. 1873 56. Season five, episode one: The Wars to ComeMance Rayder refuses to bend the knee, is burned at the stake by Stannis before Jon shoots him with an arrow. A pretty good death actually. 1973 55. Season five, episode five: Kill the BoySeason five is perhaps the weakest, and this is one of the weakest episodes in it, despite some good Bolton action and the Stone Men’s fateful attack on Tyrion and Jorah Mormont as they sailed through Valyria. In the season two opener we meet Stannis at Dragonstone, and then Joffrey orders a tremendous infanticide. It was vaguely controversial at the time. Feels like a lifetime ago. ‘Power is power,’ Cersei tells Littlefinger, which was good.Jon Snow coming back to life really shouldn’t have felt flat. Yet it did. Understandable given that it had to build an entire medieval universe, but 12 major characters are introduced here. That’s too many major characters. 2373 51. Season six, epsidoe four: Book of the StrangerJon and Sansa reunite, which is cool, Daenerys burns some more enemies, which is hot, good High Sparrow monologue to Margaery. Theme of climbing. Thormund makes his way up the Wall Littlefinger gives his most famous monologue, as he explains to Varys that chaos is ‘a ladder’. 2573 49. Season five, episode two: Sons of the HarpyMid-season doldrums, particularly acute in five, as Jaime and Bronn arrive in Dorne.The same, basically, except for Tyrion meeting Daenerys. Everyone gives each other presents. Sluggish early-season number, although we meet Olenna and Margaery shows how skilful she will be at manipulating court. Until the later series, eight episodes are a bit hamstrung by setting up denouements to follow. This is true in season one, as the machinery creaks to set up the beheading they didn’t think could happen. 2973 45. Season three, episode seven: The Bear and the Maiden FairEven re-looking at what happened in this episode I still can’t really remember it, except for the fight with the bear. Oh yes, Mackenzie Crook! Forgot he was in this programme. 3073 44. Season two, episode five: The Ghost of HarrenhalTwo good moments: Renly is killed by the shadow, and Arya meets Jaqen H’ghar. 3173 43. Season eight, episode two: \u0027A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\u0027Another slow scene setter for the epic Battle of Winterfell, full of night-before antics including the knighting of Brienne by Jamie, and the slightly disturbing sight of Arya and Gendry preparing to go at it hammer and tongs.The demise of top lad Roose Bolton, as well as Balon Greyjoy, both sent to their ends by their families. Melisandre finally works her anti-death magic on Jon Snow. 3373 41. Season four, episode five: First of His NameOne of the good things about season four was that it was the only moment where, even briefly, it looked as though a kind of temporary stability had been achieved. Tommen is king, Sansa has escaped King’s Landing, Jon Snow and co get revenge on the mutineers at Craster’s Keep. The White Walkers attacking the Night’s Watch at the Fist of the First Men is a good laugh, but other than that there is a lot to get through, after the events of Blackwater in the previous episode, and the season two finale anticipates some of the rushed feeling that will occur later on. 3573 39. Season one, episode seven: You Win or You DieOur first real glimpse of what Cersei will become, as she outmanoeuvres Ned Stark after Robert Baratheon’s death in a hunting accident. A superb Arya moment, as she wipes out the rest of House Frey, but mainly this is set-up for a season that packs a lot in.3773 37. Season one, episode four: Cripples, Bastards and Broken ThingsNed working as policeman in Kings Landing to find out what happened to Jon Arryn. 3873 36. Season five, episode nine: Dance of DragonsOne of the most upsetting deaths in Game of Thrones, as Stannis Baratheon burns his friendly daughter Shireen alive to appease Melisandre. Theon jumping off the boat after Euron overruns the Greyjoy fleet. Nice reunion between Arya and Hot Pie. Tyrion talks Daenerys down from incinerating King’s Landing.A slower than expected opener for the final season, albeit with some touching reunions at Winterfell, especially Bran and Jamie seeing each other again.  4173 33. Season six, episode six: Blood of My BloodMidseasoner. Cersei sends Jaime to retake Riverrun, while Arya is finally trained as an assassin. Can’t really remember it, to be honest. 4273 32. Season one, episode five: The Wolf and the LionJaime and Ned have a brawl in the streets of King’s Landing in an episode that focuses on skulduggery rather than magic. If you ask me skulduggery always trumps magic. 4373 31. Season three, episode three: Walk of PunishmentThe first moment where a character’s trajectory was really reversed. We’d disliked Jaime since the start, but when his hand was chopped off he began to win us back. The Blackfish schooling Edmure at shooting fire arrows was another highlight. The opening of the fourth series introduced the charismatic, enigmatic Viper of Dorne, one of the few good things other than wine to come out of Dorne. Also notable for an excellent scene with Arya and the Hound clearing out an Inn.Introduces Margaery Tyrell and Brienne of Tarth, two of the best characters, and also sees Theon decide to betray Robb Stark. What is family? Who can you trust? Built around Sansa and Tyrion’s unwelcome wedding, while in the north there is a display of how important Sam will be as he draws on reserves of bravery to dragonglass a white walker. Littlefinger dumping Lysa out of the Eyrie is probably the most dramatic moment here, one of his decisive power-stealing moments as he saves Sansa. Can you remember a time before Game of Thrones? Re-watch ‘Winter is Coming’, marvel at the baby Starks, think on how many characters have died, reflect on your own mortality. You are much, much older than when Game of Thrones began. Your life is running between your fingers. Another dramatic death which is hard to remember now, as the miserable Viserys was put out of his grump with molten gold. Well, that was that. The grand finale provoked much gnashing of teeth and hot air, not all of it from Drogon. In truth, things were tied up as best they could, given the way the the different pieces had been arranged, although some of the criticism was valid. The king-choosing and first council scenes were amazingly lame. A number of questions were skirted over. Still, what a spectacle. 5173 23. Season two, episode six: Old Gods and the NewTheon takes Winterfell. Theon, you utter bastard. I hope you are punished for this.A key Littlefinger episode, as he continues to manipulate Sansa, while Jon Snow executes Janos and, in King’s Landing, Cersei’s machinations are matched by Margaery’s. 5373 21. Season four, episode two: The Lion and the RoseJoffrey, scratching at his throat, going purple, dying. Top stuff. 5473 20. Season four, episode six: The Laws of Gods and MenAn excellent mid-season episode, built around Tyrion’s trial but with lots of other things to admire that hint at the underlying economies in the Game of Thrones universe. Drogon barbecues some livestock, while the Iron Bank of Braavos refuses to bail out Davos and Stannis. The full depravity of Ramsay Bolton is laid bare as he taunts Theon with a fake escape, while Commander Mormont is murdered at Craster’s Keep. But really it’s all about Daenerys, as she and her pets flame Astapor to the ground.5673 18. Season seven, episode seven: The Dragon and the WolfIt turns out Jon Snow is actually the true heir to the Seven Kingdoms, the remaining Stark children finally team up to kill Littlefinger, admittedly in overwrought style, and the White Walkers use their new lizard hairdryer to destroy the wall. There is far too much going on, especially the odd scene where Jon shows Cersei the wight, but nevertheless it sends you reaching for the popcorn and cheering along, which is more or less where we are at with the whole series by now. 5773 17. Season three, episode five: Kissed by FireMost notable for Ygritte and Jon’s much-parodied love grotto scene, but also for the Hound’s duel with Bendric Dondarrion, which revealed his terror of fire. Nursing his stump in the baths, Jaime tells Brienne the truth about his assassination of the Mad King. Mid-seasoner. The denouement of the fifth series is the most sympathetic we ever see Cersei, as she completes her walk of atonement through the streets of King’s Landing, her hair cut and her clothes stripped. Strategically, humiliating Cersei proves not to be the masterstroke the High Sparrow thought it would be. 5973 15. Season seven, episode four: The Spoils of WarSpoils aplenty. Arya returns to Winterfell and sees Sansa, then fights a brief duel with Brienne that shows just how much she’s learnt. It’s nothing on one of the great shots of the whole series, however: Daenerys riding Drogon above a Dothraki horde in full charge before incinerating the Lannister lines. 6073 14. Season one, episode 10: Fire and BloodWe were promised dragons, and here they are, mewing atop the naked Daenerys. And one thing we know about baby dragons is they must grow up. This is Game of Thrones’ version of Chekhov’s rule about guns. You’ll keep watching until they torch something. As the big battles go, the showdown between the Night’s Watch and wildlings and the wights at Hardhome doesn’t quite match some of the others, but it is still dead cool, especially when Jon realises his sword works against the snowmen. If that wasn’t enough, Sansa also learnt that her family might be alive. 6273 12. Season four, episode nine: The Watchers on the WallThe big set-piece between the Night’s Watch and the wildlings. Not quite up to Blackwater’s standards, despite its battle specialist Neil Marshall being summonsed back to direct.  There is too much crammed into this episode, which could have been spread over several hours, but it’s wonderful stuff all the same. Jon meets Daenerys for the first time, Sam cures Jorah of greyscale, Cersei obliterates the Tyrells. Best of all is Diana Rigg, at a table in her tower, bowing out from what is perhaps Thrones’ best overall performance. One of the most isive episodes, as Dany’s frustrations spilled over into a holocaust in King’s Landing. Whatever you thought of the pacing, or the plot’s fidelity to the characters, it was quite a spectacle, and killed off several key figures in dramatic style. Poor old Hodor. The death nobody wanted, as a wonderful character, played so sympathetically by Kristian Nairn, is finally given his due. 6673 8. Season four, episode eight: The Mountain and the ViperOther things happen: Littlefinger takes over the Vale, and the Boltons move into Winterfell, but the episode is mainly memorable for the central duel, as Oberyn seeks justice from the man who murdered so many of his relatives, and for one image above all, of the Mountain’s armoured fingers crushing Oberyn’s skull like a grapefruit. Poor old Ned Stark. The death they said could never happen! Clearly they had not watched enough Sean Bean films. After two scene-setting episodes, The Long Night finally delivers on the promise of season eight, with 90 minutes of marvellous blood and fire at Winterfell. The Night King’s hordes meet the assembled ranks of Westeros, wildlings, Dothraki and Unsullied. The defenders lose and lose and lose until they finally win, although not before a few spectacular deaths. If it lacks some of the strategic nuance of other battles, it compensates with stunning action sequences and CGI, especially on the dragons, who dogfight high above the plain.6973 5. Season six, episode 10: The Winds of WinterWinter has come. It opens with peak Cersei, as she eliminates all her remaining enemies in one enormous blaze. Arya kills Walder Frey. The Jon Theory is confirmed. Tommen walks out of the window. 7073 4. Season three, episode nine: Rains of CastemereThe Lannisters send their regards. Some would have this number one, and one could easily make the case. The Red Wedding was the scene that broke Game of Thrones out of its fandom and into broader popular culture, the point where it was no longer avoidable. Fury, anguish, love, surprise, pity, hate: it’s all here. The look Roose Bolton gives Catelyn Stark when she reveals the chainmail he is wearing to dinner might be my single favourite moment of the whole programme. 7173 3. Season six, episode nine: Battle of the BastardsAnyone who has seen Mel Gibson’s Mayan drama Apocalypto knows that running in a straight line away from arrows rarely works. So it proved for Rickon, setting up one of the great battles not only on TV but on any kind of film. Where in previous seasons battles had occasionally felt hampered by budget, most egregiously when Tyrion was knocked out and missed the whole thing, this was the full belt and braces. It was brilliantly directed, with aerial shots, as well as face-in-the-mud close-ups to convey the full grinding horror of the battle, and the grim relief of victory. The fourth season is the best all-round, I think, the high-point of character development before it started to be forced by the machinations of the plot in the later series. Brienne’s bloody brawl with the Hound leaves him bleeding and broken, as Arya heads off to Braavos. Tywin finally gets his comeuppance, a crossbow bolt on the loo, administered by his son, Tyrion, who then flees. And Stannis’s cavalry arrives to save Jon and defeat Mance Rayder and the wildlings in a pincer movement, having been persuaded by Davos. This is purely a personal view, but if Ned Stark’s death was the moment you sat up and paid attention, Blackwater was the where you started cheering at the TV. The scale, the splendour, the depth of character brought to bear on grand events: they all felt new, somehow. This might have been the last moment where we were equally rooting for both sides, except for one side to be consumed in an eerie green glow. Wildfire doesn’t care who your favourite character is. There has to be a loser. ‘Eastwatch’ throws away one of the most important pieces of information in the whole show, Jon’s true parentage, as well as lots of good reunions. It’s the clearest example of how rushed the show has become in recent years, as its unpredictability gives way to conventional plot. 273 72. Season four, episode three: Breaker of ChainsJaime appears to rape Cersei next to Joffrey’s corpse. The scene is confused, unpleasant and different from the books in confusing and unhelpful ways. The Sand Snakes are just unbearably naff and this is one of their worst.At Craster’s Keep, much rape and murder of children. Unpleasant. The opposite of the rushed plot of the later seasons, this is basically a leisurely chat up the M1. 673 68. Season eight, episode four: The Last of the StarksGiven a chance to return to real intrigue after the Battle of Winterfell, Benioff and Weiss showed they had lost their grip, with an incoherent episode that betrayed several key characters for the sake of obvious plot grinding. A Starbucks cup left on a feasting table told us everything we needed to know about a series that has given up.773 67. Season two, episode eight: Prince of WinterfellThere is some good stuff with Arya and Jaqen H’ghar, but it’s mainly placeholder as they set up the Battle of Blackwater. Jon Snow and Ygritte’s goodbye at the climax of season three ought to have been much sadder. 973 65. Season five, episode two: The House of Black and WhiteLots of setting up. Jaime and Bronn plan to go to Dorne, Arya arrives in Braavos. 1073 64. Season seven, episode six: Beyond the WallThis ought to have been one of the great battles: ice zombies plus dragons plus Jon Snow’s expedition. It looked spectacular, but everyone worried about teleporting ravens and speed of sound dragons. Some absolutely horrible banter between Grey Worm and Missandei.Pyat Pree kills the 13 in Qarth. Tywin talks to Arya about legacy.Melisandre is a very, very old woman. Lots of Tyrion talking in King’s Landing but not much else. The Hound meets Ian McShane. That’s about it in an episode full of preparations.A classic season opener that flits from place to place. 1773 57. Season two, episode four: Garden of BonesLots of grimness. Rat and bucket torture at Harrenhal. Robb Stark meets Talisa. Joffrey is cruel to Ros and Daisy. 1873 56. Season five, episode one: The Wars to ComeMance Rayder refuses to bend the knee, is burned at the stake by Stannis before Jon shoots him with an arrow. A pretty good death actually. 1973 55. Season five, episode five: Kill the BoySeason five is perhaps the weakest, and this is one of the weakest episodes in it, despite some good Bolton action and the Stone Men’s fateful attack on Tyrion and Jorah Mormont as they sailed through Valyria. In the season two opener we meet Stannis at Dragonstone, and then Joffrey orders a tremendous infanticide. It was vaguely controversial at the time. Feels like a lifetime ago. ‘Power is power,’ Cersei tells Littlefinger, which was good.Jon Snow coming back to life really shouldn’t have felt flat. Yet it did. Understandable given that it had to build an entire medieval universe, but 12 major characters are introduced here. That’s too many major characters. 2373 51. Season six, epsidoe four: Book of the StrangerJon and Sansa reunite, which is cool, Daenerys burns some more enemies, which is hot, good High Sparrow monologue to Margaery. Theme of climbing. Thormund makes his way up the Wall Littlefinger gives his most famous monologue, as he explains to Varys that chaos is ‘a ladder’. 2573 49. Season five, episode two: Sons of the HarpyMid-season doldrums, particularly acute in five, as Jaime and Bronn arrive in Dorne.The same, basically, except for Tyrion meeting Daenerys. Everyone gives each other presents. Sluggish early-season number, although we meet Olenna and Margaery shows how skilful she will be at manipulating court. Until the later series, eight episodes are a bit hamstrung by setting up denouements to follow. This is true in season one, as the machinery creaks to set up the beheading they didn’t think could happen. 2973 45. Season three, episode seven: The Bear and the Maiden FairEven re-looking at what happened in this episode I still can’t really remember it, except for the fight with the bear. Oh yes, Mackenzie Crook! Forgot he was in this programme. 3073 44. Season two, episode five: The Ghost of HarrenhalTwo good moments: Renly is killed by the shadow, and Arya meets Jaqen H’ghar. 3173 43. Season eight, episode two: \u0027A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\u0027Another slow scene setter for the epic Battle of Winterfell, full of night-before antics including the knighting of Brienne by Jamie, and the slightly disturbing sight of Arya and Gendry preparing to go at it hammer and tongs.The demise of top lad Roose Bolton, as well as Balon Greyjoy, both sent to their ends by their families. Melisandre finally works her anti-death magic on Jon Snow. 3373 41. Season four, episode five: First of His NameOne of the good things about season four was that it was the only moment where, even briefly, it looked as though a kind of temporary stability had been achieved. Tommen is king, Sansa has escaped King’s Landing, Jon Snow and co get revenge on the mutineers at Craster’s Keep. The White Walkers attacking the Night’s Watch at the Fist of the First Men is a good laugh, but other than that there is a lot to get through, after the events of Blackwater in the previous episode, and the season two finale anticipates some of the rushed feeling that will occur later on. 3573 39.

HBO had begun teasing the prequel, making cast announcements and revealing plot elements.A description of the prequel previously released by HBO reads: “Taking place thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones, the series chronicles the world’s descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour.“From the horrifying secrets of Westeros’s history to the true origin of the White Walkers, the mysteries of the East to the Starks of legend, only one thing is for sure: It’s not the story we think we know.”The Independent\u0026nbsphas contacted HBO for comment.Game of Thrones\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed4045 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.4145 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.4245 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.4345 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.4445 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.4545 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.“On advertising, it is a hundred-fold difference between what the industry spends on advertising unhealthy food, than I’ve got available to counter it with public information.”Dr Alison Tedstone, Public Health England’s chief nutritionist, said 110 retailer own brands and manufacturer brands decreased their sugar content by more than 2 per cent.However, she said 62 had increased the sugar in their products, while 154 made no change.Dental surgeons urge schools to become sugar-freeShe said: “In chapter two of the childhood obesity plan, it said the government will consider restrictions on advertising and restrictions on promotions of food. When you look at our data, you can see part of the problem is more of things being sold that are high sugar.“And therefore things that potentially affect the volume of sales are the most important.”England’s former chief medical officer\u0026nbspDame Sally Davies said she would support calls to ban the broadcasting of adverts for foods with high fat and sugar content.She told the committee: “Some (companies) are reducing (sugar content) but through marketing, more is being bought.\u0026nbspUnless the industry knows we are going to take action at the fiscal level, they are not going to move.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best – thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant.1120 10. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour – she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. “It was some years later before I really knew what she’d been going through,” her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland’s struggles with mental health issues and addiction – but you’d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It’s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”.Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long – but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it’s hard to complain. If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that “Colin goes to America” abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes’s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity.We’ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell. But there is far too much to enjoy in this ensemble romcom to write it off – namely Emma Thompson’s extraordinary, rightly revered performance as the wronged wife of Alan Rickman.There are three simple rules to keep a gremlin from wreaking havoc: don’t expose it to the light, don’t get it wet, and never feed it after midnight. Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing.Who’s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens’s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets? In his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, Michael Caine vowed to act “like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company”, whatever ridiculous antics were happening around him. His tactic worked.Though this beautiful, wordless animation is not widely known outside the UK – it was first broadcast on the then fledgling Channel 4 in 1982 and then annually ever since – it is well worth 26 minutes of anyone’s time. Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England’s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of “Walking in the Air.This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa’s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he’s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren’t for Ferrell’s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical.After revelling for a while in every child’s ill-thought-out fantasy – “I made my family disappear,” says Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him – Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you’ve ever seen.Admittedly, for about 120 of this film’s 130-minute running time, it’s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining. But it’s also warm, funny, timeless, life-affirming, and a deserved classic.When Tim Allen’s Scott Calvin accidentally kills Santa Claus (a nice, light-hearted beginning to a family film) he is expected to take his place. He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best – thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant.1120 10. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour – she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. “It was some years later before I really knew what she’d been going through,” her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland’s struggles with mental health issues and addiction – but you’d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It’s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”.Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long – but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it’s hard to complain. If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that “Colin goes to America” abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes’s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity.We’ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell. But there is far too much to enjoy in this ensemble romcom to write it off – namely Emma Thompson’s extraordinary, rightly revered performance as the wronged wife of Alan Rickman.There are three simple rules to keep a gremlin from wreaking havoc: don’t expose it to the light, don’t get it wet, and never feed it after midnight. Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing.Who’s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens’s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets? In his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, Michael Caine vowed to act “like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company”, whatever ridiculous antics were happening around him. His tactic worked.Though this beautiful, wordless animation is not widely known outside the UK – it was first broadcast on the then fledgling Channel 4 in 1982 and then annually ever since – it is well worth 26 minutes of anyone’s time. Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England’s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of “Walking in the Air.This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa’s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he’s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren’t for Ferrell’s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical.After revelling for a while in every child’s ill-thought-out fantasy – “I made my family disappear,” says Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him – Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you’ve ever seen.Admittedly, for about 120 of this film’s 130-minute running time, it’s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining. But it’s also warm, funny, timeless, life-affirming, and a deserved classic.Along with her three starring roles in the film, Hudgens has apparently signed on to produce, as well.\u0026nbspThe Princess Switch: Switched Again\u0026nbspis the latest Christmas film Hudgens has signed on for.

I was rightA no-deal Brexit is a life and death situation for meMore than 400,000 people sign letter demanding fresh Brexit referendumNo vote was taken at Tuesday morning’s meeting, where Mr Corbyn told colleagues that Labour was now able to back an election, as its condition that a no-deal Brexit must be off the table had been met.Flanked by frontbench colleagues as he announced the decision to the media, the Labour leader appeared to acknowledge that there had been ision within his party over the issue.“The Labour Party loves a debate, but they also love the end of the debate,” said Mr Corbyn. “This is the end of the debate and we are going out there to win.”One shadow cabinet source made clear there had been ided opinions in the meeting, telling The Independent: “Shadow cabinet is a place where there is always discussion, but collective responsibility reigns and people are united in going for an election.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailMr Corbyn and his inner circle, including advisers Seumas Milne and Karie Murphy, have long backed a general election ahead of any referendum on Brexit, arguing that Labour should take office and negotiate its own “credible” EU withdrawal deal before putting it to the people.But he faced growing pressure from senior colleagues, including deputy leader Tom Watson, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry to prioritise a Final Say vote ahead of a general election. In recent weeks, even close Corbyn ally John McDonnell indicated he was ready to consider the referendum-first option.In a key change of stance, Mr Corbyn resisted repeated efforts by the prime minister to trigger an election under fixed-term parliaments legislation, arguing that it should not go ahead so long as no-deal Brexit remained a risk.He stuck by this position as late as the shadow cabinet meeting on Monday, when a Halloween crash-out was taken off the table by the EU’s offer to delay Brexit to 31 January.But last\u0026nbspweekend’s decision by Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party to back a one-line bill for a December poll shifted the political calculations.Knowing that their support could deliver the election Mr Johnson wanted, Labour risked being isolated as the one major party holding out against a vote for the public, vulnerable to inevitable taunts from Tories that it was frightened of their verdict.Mr Corbyn told Tuesday’s meeting that Labour’s condition had now been met and the party would “launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen”.There was immediate dissent from within Labour ranks, with veteran MP Barry Sheerman even predicting frontbench resignations.Mr Sheerman said it was “sheer madness to hold a general election in December and on Boris Johnson’s agenda”.And he added: “A clear majority of our shadow cabinet were against a December election yesterday but Jeremy Corbyn has been persuaded to override them after interventions from Seumas Milne and Karie Murphy.”Paul Farrelly told the Commons that he would vote against an early election, as he did not believe no-deal Brexit had been taken off the table.Although supporting his party’s decision, mayor of London Sadiq Khan suggested a new referendum was still the most important next step in the Brexit process.“But if there is to be a general election first, then those whose future is most affected must be given a say – including 16- and 17-year-olds and EU citizens living in the UK,” he added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

All four were stripped of their ranks and titles.The dismissals on Tuesday followed those of six palace officials last week, including a veterinarian, a police lieutenant general in the Royal Household Bureau and a nurse certified to serve as a royal page in the regent’s bedroom.They appear to have been prompted by the dismissal of the king’s 34-year-old consort\u0026nbspSineenat Wongvajirapakdi for “disloyalty” just three months after she was appointed to the position.Created with Sketch.Coronation of Thailand King Maha Vajiralongkorn: In pictures Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Ms Wongvajirapakdi, a trained nurse and pilot who served in the royal bodyguard, was accused of being “ungrateful” and attempting to rise to the level of the queen.Experts suggested the king’s decision to take a consort for the first time since the 1920s – and then sacking her – was a demonstration of power.Thai king strips royal consort of her titles for ‘disloyalty’“By appointing an official consort and acknowledging royal polygamy for the first time in a century,\u0026nbspVajiralongkorn\u0026nbspwas sending a political signal,” historian Andrew MacGregor Marshall\u0026nbsptold The Independent.“He intends to reign as an absolute monarch like the Thai kings of the past. And by suddenly stripping his consort of her status just three months later, he is also signalling his power.“He wants Thais to recognise that he has the power to elevate people and crush people based on his whims, and nobody can stand in his way.”King\u0026nbspVajiralongkorn\u0026nbspassumed the throne following the death of his father in 2016.Additional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the voters will not forget this treachery.EX-POLICING minister Sir Mike Penning’s discovery that he could easily obtain lethal knives online using  data is shocking.As he said, this wasn’t so much a loophole in the law but a “giant chasm”.Home Secretary Priti Patel must stem the flood of such weapons, while Amazon should face severe penaltiesit has failed to police its online adverts.Knives are fuelling a spate of murders of our young people. We must do everything possible to protect the next generation.THE England rugby team’s magnicent victory over the All Blacks was simply stunning.Their grit, ambition and fair play should set an example to our politicians.We wish Wales well in their vital clash today against the mighty Springboks.What better way to unite the nation than to see an all-UK World Cup final on Saturday SPEAKING of good news, no matter how gloomy you are feeling about the Brexit stalemate and the dismal weather, you can always look forward to Thursday.Let’s hope that whoever gets the job understands better than Mr Bercow that the Speaker should work for the country.Not try to run it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has already put himself out for hire for £, in recent days.Bercow whines he is “entitled to make a living”, and after ten shouty years on the globally screened Parliament Channel he has achieved lucrative star status.As cartoon TV hero Homer Simpson has proved, audiences love grotesques.Once free from high office, Bercow can quickly fill his boots with fees worth tens of thousands a time.But could there be another motive for his decision to go now rather than after he has completely screwed Brexit Had he stayed on, it seems he risked being “tried” on incendiary allegations of bullying and bringing Parliament into disrepute — an offence which might have cost him an automatic peerage and a seat in the House of Lords.Once out, he is “beyond the jurisdiction of Parliament”.Bercow has been haunted for years by allegations of volcanic temper tantrums and humiliation of staff, including some of the Commons’ most senior officials. He denies all the claims.Official probes have been shamelessly stymied by Labour because of Bercow’s “Bollocks to Brexit” stance.Labour grandee Dame Margaret Beckett blurted out her party’s motives, insisting Bercow must stay because Brexit “trumps bad behaviour”.The hypocrisy stinks. Labour claims to be the workers’ party. Here it is standing up for the bosses’ class.Parliament has also been criticised for failing victims of bullying. But kicking these charges into touch seems to have worked.Bercow’s decision to go now has persuaded former Black Rod David Leakey and the Speaker’s ex-Private Secretary, Angus Sinclair, to abandon claims of humiliation and abuse.In  Mr Sinclair, hardened by  years before the mast, told BBC Newsnight that Bercow mimicked him and was “prone to over-the-top anger”.Mr Leakey, an ex-Army Lieutenant-General, spoke of “the red mist descending” as Bercow “banged the table, yelled and was highly insulting to me personally”.He warns the Sundaythat a Bercow peerage would bring the House of Lords into disrepute at a time when politicians’ reputations are already at an all-time low.“Whatever Bercow’s merits as Speaker, I believe he should be treated in the same way as any other successful but disreputable citizen of the country,” says Leakey.“He is disreputable because, as a high-profile public figure, he has set an appalling example to the country, not least in publicly demeaning MPs in the chamber and on television.“As a senior figure in any other organisation, his behaviour would likely have resulted in investigation, censure or even dismissal.“He should not be rewarded with ‘baubles’ or a peerage.”Having watched this snarling, purple-faced Mr Punch discredit the constitution, stain the reputation of Parliament and demean the most distinguished post in British politics, it is impossible to disagree.There is now a chance for MPs to clean out this soiled stable and restore Parliament’s reputation.Decent Labour MP and popular Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle is front-runner for the job. But none of the candidates could be worse, even preachy Labour veteran Harriet Harman.To quote the former Black Rod, it should not be rewarded by any party with an unelected place on the overstuffed red benches of the House of Lords.BREXIT-cancelling Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson thinks we are all stupid.Her plot with the SNP to stage a snap election on Monday, December , has flashing red lights all over it.It would be a vehicle for oddball amendments including votes at  – just the impressionable age when fantasy politics appeals most.She pretends she is trying to stop Boris “crashing out” with No Deal.Yet Boris wants a deal.

Harry and Meghan went to Africa, with ITV, and made that trip all about their own anxieties and issues as well, without being half as engaging or sympathetic as Scarlett Moffatt.If anything, I think The British Tribe Next Door will also live longer in my memory than the royal version, not least because C seems to have got more than it bargained for with the Himba, who clearly aren’t big on marital fidelity.Some of the men are already looking to pick off Scarlett from the back of the Moffatt herd and episode one ended with this tantalising offer, from one of the women to her mum.“Betty, let us swap husbands tonight.” .So my interest in this show is now over.DAVID ATTENBOROUGH’S Seven Worlds, One Planet lived up to the usual visually stunning expectations for nearly an hour on Sunday night on BBC.A couple of cute baby animals won their struggle for le, two gender-fluid gastropods had it off at the bottom of the Antarctic Ocean and a bull elephant seal on South Georgia discovered: “cm of blubber is protection against the cold, but not from a four-ton opponent” – a bit like Tess Holliday did when Piers Morgan went for her on Twitter.The environmental message was also conveyed, in no uncertain terms, as the seas warmed, glaciers melted and an albatross chick almost got blown to buggery.Then,  minutes into the show, we were suddenly back on South Georgia, with Rolf the seasick cameraman, who was in front of the lens this time and so overcome by the fate of the penguins, and the future of the planet, he began sobbing like Rylan Clark-Neal just after Nicole Scherzinger had put him through to live shows.All the most pointless, virtue-signalling extinction rebels in the country were probably joining in with this gesture as well, even though it’s a moot point as to how close we are exactly to environmental Armageddon.What you can say with a little more certainty, though, is that the moment it starts trying to turn a David Attenborough documentary into an X Factor sob story it’s probably the beginning of the end for the BBC.THE Last Leg, Adam Hills: “Out of ­interest, what would we all dothis ­fabulous industry we’re in fell through for us and we had to go and find a job ”Have you ever considered comedy X Factor: Celebrity, Jenny Ryan: “It’s time for me to share what I’ve got with the world.”Jonathan Ross: “He’s the host of the very funny Mash Report.

The woman, believed to be in her s, was cycling through Liwonde National Park when the elephant charged her and trampled her underfoot.She was rushed to Mangochi hospital in the back of a truck before the two British Army Medics arrived offering to help poorly equipped medical staff.There they found her in a critical state with severe wounds including internal bleeding.After they stabilised her, she was later moved to Zomba hospital where she underwent surgery.Officials said African Parks have paid for the operation and continue to pay all of her medical bills while she recovers.British troops have been working with African Parks, and the Department of National Parks and Wildle for the last three years on counter poaching operations.Our Boys and Girls are passing on elite soldiering skills to the Rangers charged with protecting endangered wildle.Since they arrived there, no “high value” species have been poached in the park.The Army currently has over  personnel deployed in Malawi on Counter Poaching Operations, which are funded by Dfid.His commanding officer Lt Col Ed Launders, at the time, praised him saying: “I will always feel honoured to have served alongside Guardsman Mathew Talbot.“He was a determined and big-hearted Coldstreamer who devoted his le to serving his country.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In post-Brexit Britain, the key swing voter is “Workington Man” — a typically white man over  who didn’t go to university and voted to Leave.Until recently he was dyed-in-the-wool Labour. Corbyn’s neglect of the working class means he might, for the first time, vote Tory.To win him round, the Conservatives must promise more than the economic freedoms and tax giveaways they are known for.They need to offer protection from a modern world in which liberalising economic policies, globalisation and immigration have undermined work, wages and community.Nearly three in four voters think it has become harder for people like them to make a decent living, so any manesto worth its salt will put ending low pay and insecure work at its heart.For the half of school leavers who lag behind without degrees, the Conservatives should ert funding from low quality university degrees towards technical education.The Tories also need to reassess their long-held devotion to tax cuts. While the cost of living is a problem, the level of taxation doesn’t seem to be.Two thirds of people want investment in the NHS, schools and social care rather than income tax cuts. This may be because households are squeezed more by rent, commuting and childcare than taxes.But people simply don’t believe politicians any more when they offer tax cuts. Instead, the Brexit idend should be focused on improving AEs and classrooms.Building local nurseries, bringing empty and foreign-owned homes into use, and boosting family budgets will win votes.Most of all, the Conservatives need to restore a greater sense of belonging.Think of your own town — the high street is probably in disrepair, libraries and buses have gone, pubs and post offices are closing. Crime is everyone’s concern. The social fabric is fraying and people feel it.New funding for high streets and towns is a start, but why not help communities take over post offices, pubs and football clubs when they go out of business, as we do for schools, or introduce a national civic service for school leavers Labour’s abiding strength is the basic sense that their politics is about looking out for others.But Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour cares more about ending control of immigration and re-running the  referendum than protecting working people.This is the only way he can reach into Labour’s heartlands to win seats like Wigan, Dewsbury and Workington, places that seek security and community over freedom and inidualism.Workington has never ed a Conservative MP in a general election.

Let’s hope history doesn’t repeat itself.For the past three years, our useless political class has pulled every trick to try to stop Brexit. PM Boris Johnson, desperate to end the gridlock, has now shamed these democracy-blockers into holding a general election. It’s a risky move.The electoral system is skewed against the Conservatives. Butopinion polls are right — andBoris can inspire ­voters with his optimism and brio — Brexit really might be unblocked by Christmas. At last!Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, after weeks of political constipation, took a dose of prune juice yesterday and, amazingly, reached a decision. Did you see his face afterwards  Pure relief. He hadn’t been that happy for months.Finally he had seen off the shroud-waving, do-nothing, block-everything Blairite Remainers in his parliamentary party — among them his ­deputy, Tom Watson.They had wanted to keep commie Corbyn swinging in the wind for a few more months. They were still ­moaning last night that he had blown this anti-Brexit ­Parliament’s last chance of securing a second referendum.Corbyn’s repeated refusals to go to the country were making him look like a politician who was scared of the people. Reaction on the doorsteps to his indecision was terrible. No wonder he finally caved.Butthe Labour leader ­yesterday seemed liberated, there were plenty on his ­Commons benches who were aghast at the idea of an ­election in December.“It’ll be too dark!” they wailed. “It’ll be too cold! People will be too busy preparing for Christmas! The students won’t be at university any more!”Too dark and too cold  Does that mean we should only ever have general elections in high summer It was even put about that Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill had advised Boris against calling a mid- December election because church halls would have been booked for school nativity plays.Now I’m as soft as any ­doting dad about kiddies dressing up to play Joseph and Mary but sorry, a general ­election to free our country from this Brexit impasse really might be more important.Why were some MPs so ­miserable yesterday  Most obviously, it was because lots of them think they’ll lose their seats. Anyone with a majority of fewer than , will ­probably be feeling twitchy, particularlyhe or she spent the last three years resisting the ­public’s will on Brexit.Money was another factor. Fighting an election is ­expensive for MPs. They not only lose their Westminster income once ­Parliament is dissolvedbut they also have to dig into their pockets for expenses and ­election costs.All those leaflets, all that petrol and shoe leather, all those late-night takeaways with volunteers — the sums soon add up. A Tory MP once told me that an election campaign cost him £,.But Parliament needs rebooting. At the  election, both Labour and the Conservatives promised to respect the Leave vote — and they duly won most of the seats.But Labour broke that ­promise, as the antics of ­Corbyn, Keir Starmer, Hilary Benn and Co showed. Leave voters in Labour seats are less likely to be fooled a second time.The one unknown in the election will be Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. Could it yet lose the election for Boris by taking votes away from the pro-Brexit Tories  What an own goal that would be.Ben Bradshaw, arch- Remainer Labour MP for Exeter, called yesterday’s ­election moves “outrageous”. We were at a “critical juncture for our country”. He plainly thought that only MPs should have a say.Keep the unwashed voters where they belong, eh, Ben  Barry Sheerman, another Remainer Labour MP, professed himself “puzzled and deeply disappointed” by Corbyn’s support for an election.Sheerman feared “the elderly” would not be able to get to polling stations on a December day. Mr Sheerman himself is . If we all took his patronising attitude, we might ask how the old dearie manages to totter down to Westminster from his Huddersfield constituency every week.At such an advanced age, how does Barry remember to tie his laces, let alone make his terrible speeches in the Commons  But no one does ask that, thank goodness, because we do not treat older people like ­simpletons.On Monday Labour MP Seema Malhotra fretted about students losing their right to vote in a December election because they might have ended their college terms by then and have moved back home.  She called this “voter ­suppression”.Oh come off it. She and her Remainer mates were the only ones trying to “suppress” voters — by trying to prevent a ­clearout of this rotten House of Commons.Former Labour MP John Mann shouted: “It’d solve you — you’d lose your seat.” And not just Soubry. Lots of these anti-democrats are now at the mercy of the real bosses of British politics — the voters.I think we’ll just about ­manage to get to the polling station, don’t you Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That commitment is absolute.”Jeremy Corbyns left his house today in a green tie to mark the release of the report into the Grenfell fire.Its likely that he and Boris will speak in a debate on the fire today in the House of Commons.And Corbyn said:“I pay tribute to the heroic actions of firefighters in our country every day, including on the night of the Grenfell Tower fire. It wasnt firefighters who diluted building regulations or put flammable cladding on Grenfell Tower.“Those who lost their lives that night and their families will continue to suffer injustice, until these real failures are addressed.“Thousands of people are still at risk because of the government’s failure to remove similar cladding from other tower blocks. “Given the huge strain on our fire service after years of Tory cuts, the next Labour Government will increase resources going to the fire service and recruit additional firefighters.”Labours Richard Burgon is shaking the money buckets in front of Labour supporters already.Both parties will be taking a hard look at their coffers to see how best to splash the cash to fight a huge campaign.Can you support East Leeds Labour members’ campaign to get me re-elected by making a small donation here  👉 https:t.co bTtldxcn pic hLQuVhUHmdash Richard Burgon MPOctober , We havent heard much from Boris since the result of his much-wanted election vote last night.But luckily, Parliament is still sitting and weve got PMQs coming up this lunchtime.Hell be sure to kick off his campaign by pushing his messages on Brexit, as well as delivering on the NHS, police and schools.mdash Simon Hoare MPOctober , Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the Tory lead of between % and % is much lower than the  to -point advantage Theresa May had two years ago. Can history repeat itself, with Jeremy Corbyn again surprising his critics  Here’s how Labour could win the election... Promote Labour’s positive agenda Labour goes into the campaign with a radical set of policies that poll well with the public. These include re-nationalising the railways, a Green New Deal, a national education service and free social care. The party needs to frame these policies as a post-Brexit settlement that will transform the country in the same way the  Labour government changed Britain after the war. It needs a punchy slogan that shows it is doing something transformational, not just commenting on the legacy of the Tories’ rule.   Expose Tory weakness on BrexitLabour’s position of wanting to renegotiate a deal and then put it to a referendum lacks the clarity of Boris Johnson ’s “get Brexit done”.But the Prime Minister goes into the contest having broken his “do or die” vow to leave by October . This means he could be vulnerable to Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party which could help deny the Tories a majority in some marginal seats. Labour needs to hammer home that Johnson’s proposed deal is bad for jobs, threatens workers’ rights and could see the NHS opened up to private US health firms.   Stay united Divided parties do not win elections. Labour has too often been engaged in internal power struggles rather than taking the fight to the Tories. Corbyn could help mend isions by halting immediately the trigger ballots of Labour MPs and reaching out to deputy leader Tom Watson. In turn, Labour MPs need to rally behind the leader and his ambitious policy .  Labour’s army of activists With four parties in play in England – and five in Scotland and Wales – the outcome could come down to the results in a few marginal seats. Labour is defending  seats with majorities of fewer than , votes. The Tories are defending  seats with majorities under ,. This is where Labour’s army of activists could prove decisive. Labour has the largest membership of any party in Europe – , – which, when coupled with Momentum, means it has the edge when it comes to knocking on doors. The first step must be to get young voters, who are more likely to back Labour, to register to vote.   Play to Corbyn’s strengths Corbyn is a natural campaigner and the TV debates could be crucial. He must come across as calm and statesmanlike to show up Johnson’s shallow showmanship. Labour also needs to show it has a strong team, with voters electing not just Corbyn but a shadow Cabinet including John McDonnell, Keir Starmer, Tom Watson, Angela Rayner and Emily Thornberry.  Donapost let it be a Brexit election For most voters Brexit is not the defining issue. For low-income households the biggest concerns are living standards, jobs and the state of their local area. An estimated . million people on low incomes are swing voters. If Labour can show its policies will improve their lives it will stop disgruntled Leave voters in key seats from switching to the Tories.   Hold the Tories to account for their record Johnson has tried to blunt Labour’s strongest attack lines by pledging a national minimum wage hike and extra money for the police and the NHS. Labour needs to dismantle these claims and show it is the only party committed to restoring our public services. They should also remind voters how Tory cuts have hit the elderly, families and communities. Voters could punish the Tories for  years of austerity, stagnant wages, the housing crisis and public sector cuts.  Broadcasting rules matter During an election the broadcasters are obliged to give the main parties equal coverage. This makes it easier for Labour to get its message across. For instance,Labour spends two days campaigning on the NHS the main TV stations cannot ignore it. Allies of Corbyn are convinced this, and their slick social media operation, helped win seats in .

With the help of other drivers on the dual-carriageway, he managed to pull the car across two lanes and onto a grass verge before it eventually came to a stop.And Lauren told Surrey Live Benaposs heroics likely saved their lives.The freak one-off seizure happened as the pair travelled down a main road in Essex in December last year. Ben said: We were about five minutes away from home, I asked a question about a song and she didnapost answer, then she didnapost answer about three times. Then I waved in front of her face. The car hit the barrier and was shaking as we were scraping it. Then when mum completely passed out I got the steering wheel and went across the lanes onto the grass. I was  out of  scared.    Lauren was unconscious for around half an hour in total and can only remember the moments before the seizure, but has been able to piece together what happened with the help of Ben, witnesses and paramedics. The mum, who now lives in Deepcut, Surrey with her son, added: Where I worked at a primary school at the time, Ben went to the same school. It was about a -minute drive from Colchester to the school in Harwich. We were just driving home from school one day, we were about  minutes into the journey, so we were really close to home, and then I suddenly had a seizure.    Sometimes they canapost explain it and it will suddenly happen for no reason, or for stress oryouaposre on certain types of medication sometimes evenyou just have a cold, your body doesnapost handle it as well as it normally does and your body canapost cope with it. It was just a freak one-off. I didnapost feel like I had a seizure, either, I just felt like I had blinked for a split-second. It was really weird. It was really scary. We were in the slow lane on a busy A-road, but we were still able to go mph. I remember going mph and seeing a sign that our turning was two miles away.

He told me he thought he needed to get on the grass as there were no cars there. I woke up and tried to start the car because, to me, it felt like a split second, so I thought I was still driving.

The large Price family have been living on a developed part of Olive Tree Park in Cheadle, Staffordshire for more than ten years.In that time David and Johanna, their three sons, their spouses and six grandchildren have had to make do with one toilet between them, Stoke Sentinel reported .Now, following a decade long tussle with the local council, the Price family have been given permission to extend the current amenity building. The new, larger building will contain a shower, toilet and a day room.    The application has been rubber stamped despite opposition from parish councillors. In his report to Staffordshire Moorlands District Council, planning officer Benjamin Hurst said: “The applicants are travellers that have a nomadic way of le, particularly in respect of their work and employment. The familyaposs ‘gypsy status’ for planning purposes has been previously accepted by the council. The existing caravan site that provides their accommodation was granted a planning permission last year. Mr Hurst went on to describe the small building currently on site. It measures just . metres by five metres, has a small kitchenette, a single toilet and a shower to service the three pitch caravan site. “The building would be extended so that in addition to the existing kitchenette there would be an additional toilet and shower taking site total to two toilets and two showers and one separate ‘day room’, he continued. “The day room would be available to all site occupants and, in particular, provide the children with space to study or be active when they can not be outside. “The caravan site provides a settled base for the travelling families toto in relation to their nomadic way of le. When the families cease using the site it is a condition of the planning permission that the utility building shall be removed. If the building were extended permission for a new larger building could be subject to a very similar condition that requires it to be removed when it is no longer needed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lying bride fleeced fiance 30","story":"NewsBride-to-be fleeced fiance and his  mates out of £, stag do cashRachel Doran had secretly been spending the money on herself and online gambling sitesShareCommentsByLucy Thornton:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsChris Mahone was ripped off by Rachel Doran \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The unsuspecting stag party discovered their flight tickets from Leeds Bradford airport were all fake. With rising panic the stags called ahead to the Ibiza Rocks hotel on the party isle and found that no bookings had been made. Nuclear process worker Chris, , realised with horror that while they had been planning their wedding, his fiance had secretly been spending the £, stag do cash on herself.    When he rang from the airport to ask her what had happened to the cash, Doran told him she was pregnant. But her internet history later revealed she had searched the words fake ultrasound picture maker. Doran, , fled the home they shared in Cleator Moor, Cumbria, when Chris told her the wedding was off and he never wanted to see her again.Doran avoided prison at Carlisle crown court on Tuesday after she admitted stealing from the stag party and forging Jet flight documents.   The court was told that Doran and Mr Mahone were childhood friends who had met at school, later starting a relationship. Their wedding date was set for December  and the groom had planned a three day stag party for September. Doran was made the treasurer for the stag do and helped organise it along with two of Mr Mahoneaposs best friends. She collected £ from each of the stags and was supposed to bank it to pay for their flights and hotels. Instead she frittered it away on herself and online gambling sites.

They persuaded the bus company there had been a mistake and a driver came out to take them to Leeds Bradford.

He rang the Ibiza Rocks Hotel and discovered that no bookings had been made. It became clear the Jet booking confirmation form was a fake document and it was then that Mr Mahone tried to ring Miss Doran on her mobile phone but she did not answer initially. Later in the day Miss Doran phoned him wanting to talk and he told her to leave him alone as he wanted nothing to do with her. She texted him later and told him she was pregnant.

Megan Argyle was diagnosed at  with the rare condition known as uterus didelphys - which caused her to have two cervixaposs, two wombs with an oy in each and one vagina. The mum-of-one - who miraculously fell pregnant in  - was told there is a  per cent chance of miscarryingshe tried for children and was later diagnosed with endometriosis after suffering with excruciating pains in her lower abdomen. Megan from Hull, Yorks, says she is happier without her reproductive organs as she can finally aposbe a mum againapos. She said: A double hysterectomy was the best decision I have ever made, I needed to get my quality of le back so I can be the best mum to my daughter Rubie, five.    I feel incredibly lucky to have her after the doctors warned me at  that I must try for a baby before Iaposm  and the chance of miscarriage was very high. I was only  with my whole le ahead of me, I had never thought about children before, but it seemed like a now or never decision as the endometriosis was getting worse and can cause further fertility problems. I suffered one miscarriage before giving birth to my miracle baby Rubie at  but it has been so hard for me to enjoy activities with her because of my crippling endometriosis. Despite four ablations - a surgically procedure that destroys the lining of the uterus and reduce menstrual flow whilst burning endometriosis away - it continued to grow back leaving Megan in constant pain. She was desperate for a hysterectomy and requested one aged  years old, but medics were reluctant as they wanted to try contraceptive methods instead.    She tried all contraceptive pills and a coil for each cervix - one of which became embedded and was surgically removed. She adds: Nothing was helping, my heavy periods continued, and the pain never stopped. My quality of le was getting worse and worse Iaposve lost count of how many times I was signed off work. I would change up to three sanitary pads per hour and I was in constant agony to the point where I have to curl into a ball.I have also been known to sit on the floor in shops as I physically couldnapost walk any more.  I was put into an induced menopause, but I continued to bleed so the doctor agreed a hysterectomy is the best option for me. Although Megan had both uterusaposs removed on October  - her oies were not removed so she can have children through the surrogacy in the future. She adds: When I was , I ripped the septum which is a iding wall of tissue in the vagina when I was having sex with my then boyfriend. The blood was gushing out and I knew something wasnapost right, I went to the hospital and they discovered I have two cervixaposs and two uterusaposs.

success at Somerset Park came on the back of a devastating late collapse at home to bottom side Partick the week previously.And Kerr says the belief that victory over the Championship’s second-placed team has given Dundee is bigger than just three points.He told the Tele: “It was important to get past the Partick game straight away.“There was pressure on Friday night with where Ayr are in the league.“When you go to places like Ayr, with the conditions there and it being such an important game, to come away with a result is big.“It wasn’t the best of games and a good battle but to come away with three points and a good resilient performance is massive for us.”The Wasps may be at the wrong end of the table but have already shown they are a match for anybody in the ision, including a - win over leaders Dundee United just three weeks ago.They also ran Dundee close at Dens Park, missing a penalty to allow the Dark Blues to run out - victors.“Alloa showed they can play when they were up here and I saw the Friday night game against Dundee United and they played really well that night,” Kerr added.“I don’t knowUnited were off-colour that night but Alloa certainly played well.“Against us they missed a penalty and had chances so we have to be on our game.“We’re under no illusions how tough it is going to be but we need to show the same application we have shown recently, apart from the latter stages of the Partick game.“We need to show resilience, calmness on the ball and patience.“I think we are getting to that.“Being a team coming together at the start of the season we knew it would take a bit of time.“There is still a long way to go to where we want to be but we are taking strides towards that.”A part of that was winning their first three points on the road.Before the trip to Somerset Park, Dundee had just two points to show from their first four away trips.They’ve put that to bed – now they want their first back-to-back victories of the Championship season, according to Kerr.He added: “Getting our first away win in the league is a good wee hurdle to get over.“The longer those things go, the more its talked about which can be a distraction from what is actually important which is going on the park and performing.“Getting two in a row now is the aim.“Whether it’s a home game where everyone expects a win or an away game where you are going to have to dig deep, we go into it with only one thought and that is to come away with the three points. We have to have that mentality.“It’s also good to have a run of games close to one anotherthings are going well, especially after a win it’s good to bounce back with another game.”Set-pieces have been a problem area for the Dark Blues this season. Ayr’s goal from Luke McCowan came after Kerr was beaten in the air from a free-kick.The full-back, though, is honest enough to hold his hands up and says he’s doing all he can to improve that part of his game.“That’s something I need to get better at. I always look at myself and what I can improve on and that’s something I need to look at personally.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5db2ad05abd6b8.82495880.jpg ","title":"downfield golf course submit plans for driving range","story":"Management at a city golf course have remained tight-lipped over claims of illegal tree-felling even after submitting plans for a new driving range nearby.Officers at Scottish Forestry are continuing to probe activity at Downfield Golf Course after trees were cut down on land earmarked for a new housing development.Earlier this year the club submitted a planning application in partnership with developer Kirkwood Homes to build  homes on the land beside Dalmahoy Drive.It has been suggested by both the club and the housebuilder that the project is essential to guarantee the long-term future of the course.However, the trees have been felled before planning permission was even approved – leading to local residents accusing developers of a “done deal”.Scottish legislation requires that anyone looking to cut down trees needs to get a felling permission from the government, eventhe plants are not protected.A felling permission for the golf club was granted in  but has since expired.In addition, the land on which the trees have been cut down is designated as a “locally important nature conservation site” by the council.Despite this, the local authority has insisted that the land is not bound by any protective measures.Both Dundee City Council and Kirkwood have denied being behind the tree-felling.And despite repeated requests for comment the club is yet to respond.The Tele visited the club’s offices last week and were told the course manager, John Watson, was on holiday until this week.And despite the club’s ongoing silence, a new planning application has been submitted to city planners proposing a new driving range.Designs for the new driving range have been drawn up with the proposed housing in mind.A .m-high embankment is proposed for the furthest end of the field to protect the most vulnerable homes from wayward golf balls."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/19595097-940x555.jpg ","title":"dundee united 2 0 dunfermline clark comes back to haunt pars as utd stay top","story":"Nicky Clark turned in a man-of-the-match display against his former team Dunfermline to help Dundee United to a vital - win and cement their place at the top of the table.The former Pars hitman teed up Lawrence Shankland for the opener on nine minutes before curling in a tremendous free-kick on  minutes to win the Tangerines all three points and keep top spot in the Championship outright.United manager Robbie Neilson made three changes from the - defeat at Queen of the South with Jamie Robson, Peter Pawlett and Clark coming in for Paul Watson, Sam Stanton and Louis Appere.Unbeaten in their last four, Dunfermline only showed one dference to their starting XI with Andy Ryan coming in for Kevin Nisbet for the Tannadice clash.And it was United who started strongest as they took the lead on nine minutes.Liam Smith#s initial delivery from the right caused Cammy Gill in the Pars goal to flap at the ball and when Clark launched it back into the box, Shankland made no mistake from six yards out to net his th United goal of the season.Two minutes later Dunfermline threatened to net a quick equaliser but Benjamin Siegrist in the home goal was a match for Ryan#s header. On  minutes, the Pars had another chance to draw level but Kyle Turner blasted over from  yards.However, it was former Par Clark who came back to haunt his old side three minutes later as the Terrors doubled their lead.After Ian Harkes was fouled on the edge of the box, Clark smashed home his first of the season with a curling right-footed free-kick from  yards out leaving Gill rooted to the spot.Paul McMullan nearly made it - on  minutes, sliding onto Smith#s low delivery at the front post, but Dunfermline managed to clear the danger.Three minutes after the restart Calum Butcher rled a full volley just over the bar from  yards after the ball broke kindly for the Englishman.Having only just ed from injury there was concern over Robson on  minutes when he went down in his own box but after receiving treatment he was OK to continue.On  minutes the Fers had their best chance of the match as Josh Edwards slid in former Terror Ryan Dow but Siegrist got down well to deny the attacker from close in.The home side bounced back, though, as Clark was denied a double by a well-timed Lee Ashcroft block in the box following Pawlett#s cutback.Second-half sub Nisbet threatened to claw one back for Stevie Crawford#s men but his volley into the ground bounced over on  minutes.On  minutes Dunfermline came even closer, this time Nisbet feeding Ryan who cracked a curling effort off the crossbar.United were able to close out the final moments, despite heavy pressure from the visitors, to snap a two-game losing streak and tighten their grip on top spot.With Ayr United losing to Dundee on Friday night and Inverness falling to Morton, the Terrors move three points clear at the Championship summit.Dundee United : SiegristSmith, Robson, Reynolds , Brown Butcher , Harkes McMullan, Pawlett , ClarkShankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Stanton, Watson.Dunfermline : GillComrie, Edwards, Martin , Ashcroft Paton, Cochrane , Turner , Dow Kiltie, Ryan.Subs not used: Scully , Beadling, Morrison, Coley.Ref: Steven Reid.Att: ,."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.47950191-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.47950191-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.47950191-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.47950191-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dundee united record 3 7m loss in last year","story":"Dundee United have posted a loss of more than £. million in the last year.An annual report for shareholders details a deficit of £,,, compared to £, for the previous year, as reported by the BBC.The  figure was reduced by £.m of sell-on fees.Salary costs, including pensions and social security contributions, also came in at £,,, % of an annual turnover of £,,.American owner Mark Ogren has allayed any fears by vowing to continue his financial backing.#The signicant loss emphasises the level of financial investment made by Mark Ogren to the club,# said a Dundee United board statement in advance of Tuesday#s AGM.#[It also] includes the costs associated with undertaking the restructuring that was required, including a complete overhaul of the first-team playing squad and coaching staff, and restructuring the academy.#"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d970e153c3919.99006593-e1570180930942.jpg ","title":"lawrence shankland ups and downs are part of the game utd must embrace","story":"Talisman Lawrence Shankland insists he knows what he signed up for playing for Dundee United in the Championship and is pleased to see they’re dealing with the ision’s ups and downs.United bounced back from two poor away defeats at Alloa and Queen of the South with a - win over Dunfermline at Tannadice on Saturday, with Shankland opening the scoring with his th goal of the season.The result left the Tangerines three points clear at the top of the table but, summer signing from Ayr United, Shanks knows there are more twists and turns to come.“There’s many ups and downs, probably more than other leagues,” the -year-old said.“You experience it quite a lot, you’re on a high and then there’s a bad result around the corner.“That’s just the way the league is and it’s the same for everybody. We just need to make sure that,we do get a bad result or two, we bounce back in the right way.“We did that on Saturday with a positive result and positive performance.“I knew what I was coming to, I knew I was coming to a big club in this ision especially.“I knew the objectives of the club and for myself as well.“I’m a striker soI go out there and score goals people will take to you.

That’s what we looked to do on Saturday because we knew we had a tough week ahead. It was good to go and get the victory to start the week positively.“It’ll definitely be a tough test. Thistle were always a well-drilled side, even before McCall went there, and they’ll be the same again.“They might even be better but it’s a tough fixture because they’re a good side with good players.“It’s another test like Saturday was which we need to take in our stride and, hopefully, go and get a good result. Obviously the home form is a positive because you need to win as many home games as you can but we’re not going to get carried away and feel like we need to beat everybody.“We just need to turn up and do our jobs week-in, week-out and make sure that we’re performing at our best when we’re at home. vw, px\"  “If we do that, we’ll get results.“We had two disappointing results in the last two games away from home and it’s something that happens in this league.“You see teams dropping points all over the place so it is like that.“If we keep our home form good, though, and win most of our games then we can maybe afford to drop a couple away.“Obviously, we’ll look to go up to Inverness on a real grass pitch as well, which helps, and put on a performance there. But we have a big test tonight first.”Nicky Clark got the second goal against Dunfermline on Saturday after teeing up Shankland, leading the hitman to praise his colleague.“It was good to get back on the scoresheet with a tap in and I was delighted to see Clarky get his first goal and get off the mark as well.“Earlier in the season we had glimpses of playing with each other but he got injured. It’s good to see him back in the starting line-up and he topped it off with a great goal.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.47950191-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.47950191-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.47950191-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.47950191-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"win 100 with the teles fantastic strictly come dancing competition every friday","story":"Every Friday whilst Strictly Come Dancing is gracing our TVs the Tele is giving you the chance to cash in!Every Friday, each copy of the Eveningwill have the name of one of the dancers taking part on the show printed on the front page along with a Unique Reference Number.If your dancer is voted off on Sunday then you are in with a chance to win £!TO ENTER:Simply enter your dancer#s name and Unique Reference Number in the boxes below along with your contact details…that’s it!Good luck!Entry to this competition is by registering online only.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

Her partner Rebecca Taylor read music as an organ scholar at Lincoln College, Oxford before attending the Royal Academy of Music where she was a Junior Fellow and completed the MA in Piano Accompaniment.The audience were introduced to the pair with an intense piece by Mozart about burning letters and it certainly woke us up. We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness. It was aAs a light and fun ending we were given #I can be a sexy lady#, a piece about poor mezzos and how they always play boys and not much  in operas.

A fabulous five goal haul and a carpet burn saw them run out - winners.Match three versus Browns from Vilamoura was always going to be a tough test and thanks to a fantastic rearguard action from Sneddon and MacDonald, allied to goals from Litster and Johnston, Jerry Hatricks came out - victors.Knowing that victory in the penultimate match against the Lagos Tigers would all but see them through it was left to Kilcolm to make his mark. A fantastic solo effort in a - win capped a great team performance. Tom would have run around with the customary shirt over the head celebration, however he found the snug fit just too much to pull over his head.By the time the final game took place the team had both done enough and run out of steam. Victory was secured and Captain Anderson#s coat was no longer on that shoogly peg.Ex Liverpool legends John Aldridge and Alan Kennedy were on hand to present the trophy. Thanks were extended at the after match banquet to the organisers, Lagos Strollers Walking Football Club for an excellent tournament and to all the players for their sporting attitude throughout the matches.Remember Lochgilphead walking football takes place every Tuesday at the sports centre, .-.pm.

further improvements are required across much of the local authorityambitious savings plans and satisfaction ratings are to be met.Audit Scotland carried out a major review into Scottish Borders Council between January and May.As well as interviewing councillors and senior officers, auditors sat in on meetings, reviewed documents and files, and held meetings with trade union representatives.While the resulting -page report card highlights an improving picture since the previous audit in , bosses have been told to communicate better and form better relationships with partners, such as NHS Borders.The report also highlights required improvements in some departments and the need for elected councillors to be better equipped for the tough decisions they face.Graham Sharp, chair of the Accounts Commission, told us: ldquoThe continued progress Scottish Borders Council has made to transform services is encouraging.\"Now it must focus on several critical areas including tackling underperforming services, ensuring councillors have the right training to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities and getting to grips with both staff and community engagement.Across the  performance indicators used in the Best Value Assurance Report, Scottish Borders Council was found to be below average in more than half.While education and social work are doing well, other aspects of the local authority arent quite making the grade.A lack of investment in creating employment and boosting tourism was criticised, as was the low amount of contracts awarded to local companies and the fall in the number of bills settled within  days.The deteriorating condition of local authority buildings was also highlighted.Problems since the outsourcing of IT services to multinational firm CGI - a -year contract worth pound million - were also raised by auditors.While the report identies the delays and issues which plagued customer access of the councils online services, auditors said it was too soon to gauge the impact of iPads taking over more traditional teaching methods in Borders schools from this year.And the methodology of farming out senior staff, such as the Executive Director for Commercial Activity spending four days of his week as managing director of the failed SB Cares, and the Executive Director for Strategic Partnerships seconded to the South of Scotland Enterprise Agency three days each week, was also questioned.The report stated: \"While this is a positive and innovative approach aimed at realising the councils wider ambitions, it must continue to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to deliver local services.\"But, perhaps, coming in for the most criticism was the current culture of secrecy and the need for better communication and engagement with staff, councillors and the public.The report stated: \"The council should be more effective in evaluating, managing and reporting its performance, bringing greater clarity on where and how its services need to improve.\"It also needs to get better at the reporting of performance - both in terms of information considered by members and in reporting to the public.\"Budgeting at the local authority, though, was applauded by auditors.And, during extremely dficult economic times, the managing to maintain its usable reserves in case of emergencies was also identied.Although Audit Scotland identied further development was needed for the ambitious Fit for  mid-term savings plan, which aims to trim pound. million from budgets by , the report is complimentary of cost cutting to date.The report stated: \"The council has a good record of achieving savings and has reflected the impact of demographic change on demands for services and pay increases for staff, in its financial plans.\"However, in common with all other councils, the financial outlook remains a signicant challenge.\"Council chief executive Tracey Logan welcomed the detailed analysis of her local authority.And she admitted many of the problems in the Audit Scotland report are already being tackled.She told us: \"We will take on board Audit Scotlandrsquos feedback and recommendations, many of which we had already identied ourselves and are taking action on, and continue to drive forward transformational change across all our services through our Fit for

Council will be asked rethink its controversial playparks proposals, following two petitions that were signed by over a thousand concerned residents.In May , the council agreed plans to consult on the possible closure of  small playparks it says are underused and falling into disrepair.Instead, the council plans to spend poundm over the next decade on six large playparks, three skateparks and four fitness shelters.However, following a backlash from residents in Hawick and Kelso, two petitions have been handed into the local authority objecting to the plans.Nine Kelso playparks are at risk of closure: High Croft Meadow Court Orchard Park Rosewood Gardens Springwood Rise Spylaw Park Sydenham Court Woodside Gardens and the Kelso petition has attracted  signatures.Ten playparks are at risk in Hawick: Bowden Road Burnfoot School Hawick Green Hislop Gardens Leaburn Drive Mayfield Millers Knowe Waverley Walk Wellington Court and Wilson Drive and the Hawick petition has attracted  signatures.Those petitions were presented to the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee today, October , so it could hear from the lead petitioners and decide how to respond.Appearing before the committee, Kirsty Wichary, lead petitioner for Kelso, told councillors: ldquoWhat do we want our towns to look like in the future  Financial constraints aside, do we not look to have a beautul Borders, with outdoor spaces for all to enjoy ldquoHow did we get to this point, where there is no money for these parks  Investing in new technology for education is to be applauded, butparents had a choice, which would they choose ldquoTechnology isnrsquot helping our children to lead healthy, well-rounded lives. The stress of being a youngster in the st century is enormous.ldquoWe should be investing in more play areas and green spaces instead of taking them away.ldquoThe thought of removing these playparks seems a very backwards step, a step towards a cultural desert and a future for our youngsters with more weight problems, more mental health issues and future generations unable to communicate effectively, even within their own peer groups.ldquoDo you really want to be remembered as the council who handed out iPads but took away the parks Hawickrsquos lead petitioner, Greg Dalgliesh, owner of the townrsquos Think Fitness  Less gym in Hawick, was unable to attend the meeting due to a family bereavement, soHawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer presented his petition on his behalf.He told the committee: ldquo mainly local residents, parents and family members in Hawick have chosen to exercise their right to object to a proposal that would see  playparks across the Scottish Borders, including  in Hawick, the largest town in the Borders, effectively close as a result of a disinvestment of financial support from this council.ldquoThe vast majority of these people and the many who support this action through other means are stakeholders in Scottish Borders Council. They live here, they are required to pay their council tax and, consequently, they have a right to determine how that money should be spent.ldquoI quote from the petition: lsquowe believe in this instance lsquobigger and better facilitiesrsquo should not be justication to remove the smaller playparks that are situated in the ious housing estates in Hawick and the Borders.ldquolsquoIt is very clear from the comments associated with this petition and via social media these smaller parks are still well used and have been described as a safe place to play and exercise on the doorstep of many homes.ldquo lsquoNot everyone can access the likes of Wilton Lodge Park on a regular basis, and children with additional needs also find these areas too busy and noisyrsquo.Councillors discussed a number of possible actions including sending the playpark proposals back out to the public for further consultation and gauging the opinion of community councils in affected areas.In the end, councillors voted to support sending a motion to the next full council meeting, scheduled for Thursdayasking it to reconsider giving authority to officers to determine which playparks can be closed.That motion was proposed by Tweeddale East councillor Heather Anderson and seconded by Selkirkshire councillor Elaine Thornton-Nicol.A counter motion, proposed by East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton and seconded by Jedburghrsquos Scott Hamilton, was also put forward, but it lost out to Ms Anderson and Ms Thornton-Nicolrsquos suggestionby five votes to three.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Wichary said: ldquoIrsquom very happy that itrsquos going to have to go back to the council to be reconsidered.ldquoIrsquom assuming, hopefully, that our petitions in both Kelso and Hawick have given them a lot of food for thought and that we wonrsquot see the closure of all the parks that were mentioned.ldquoItrsquos very clear that there are cost implications, but Irsquom quite confident that there will be some sort of compromise made.Mr McAteer added: ldquoI am delighted that the majority of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee have supported the Hawick petition designed to stop the council closing a number of our playparks.ldquoTheir decision will now resulted in this matter being referred to a full meeting of Scottish Borders council where elected members

And a reminder that Im not getting any younger as I try to grow old gracefully.JCCs, now a septuagenarian, style has remained a constant.His image of the suit, shagpile black hair and sunglasses remain intact. His social realism poetic constructs seem relevant today as they did during his inception, extrapolated initially from the often nihilism and tales of social decay that earmarked punk mark one.Poetry is often a barometer of an epoch or epochs. Combining observation and the written word. JCC has become a master of mind imagery, social commentary, surrealism, and semantics and above all story telling. We get it because it resonates with us.It is us or we know someone who it references. Sometimes dystopian, often hilarious and never dull. Add the heavy Salfordian brogue the chemistry set is complete.The performance was slightly peculiar to what I was expecting.Maybe my expectations were misguided or unrealistic. There were some long periods of stand-up comedy that laboured at times.It was only when \"Johnny\" ed to his natural home of poetry recital that he got back on track. Though his joke about Billy Bragg being in crisis because he hadnt released an album in two weeks, I found amusing.But when he got back to the poetry it was a reminder why most people were here.Most poems were from the back catalogue and instantly recognisable. A greatest hit set list.JCC proceeded with Hire Car and the sharply expletive named Get Back on Drugs You Fat F***.Well it was an adult show after all.Common language for common poetry. And it never did Billy Connelly any harm. The poem insinuating it was easier to lose weight being on drugs.Beasley Street, arguably his most well-known poem received one of the best reactions of the night. Imbued with the description of a rock bottom street, a dreg of society and where everything that could go wrong did in this street. A caricature of a threadbare existentialism. Mainly bought on by social and economic deprivation.And then a natural supersession in the form of an epilogue Beasley Street Bouled recital, as the street had now changed into middle class suburbia.Next up Ive Fallen in Love with My We. A reference to marriage, the vows and marital bliss. Tongue in cheek of course.The \"bloody song\" Evidently Chickentown, was greeted with widespread applause. More nihilistic scorn and deprecation of a town, that is in a state of dys.Funny how we tend to laugh at the misfortune of others. But we do.Twat was another poem that represented consistency in tonights performance. A crowd pleaser for all times. Twat being the ultimate character assassination and castout. Bringing sporadic fits of laughter within the audience.The closing recital I Wanna Be Yours, famously adopted by The Arctic Monkeys for one of their songs, represented a slight U-turn in the writing of JCC. More linked to a character who wishes to show an undying love for someone . The positives of the human condition. Did I detect some optimism!The MacArts performance had poetry that mixes modernity with the historical. Comedic in value.When we laugh, we are laughing at ourselves. With him, not at him.

There are many people walking around freely drinking during these times.ldquoThis makes it dficult to identy those young people who are underage drinking when there are such crowds.Another wrote: ldquoIntoxication in these areas is unpleasant to witness. In all cases we are entitled not to be subject to the loudness and antisocial behaviour this leads to.On the other hand, some respondents voiced their concerns about bringing in alcohol bylaws: ldquoI think itrsquos a complex situation which deserves time and thought. Irsquom not entirely sure that reacting in a retrospective way is the best approach.ldquoI feel there are many behaviours and traditions entrenched in Scottish and Borders society around drinking habits.ldquoI feel personally that there are alternatives for many people socially that do not centre around drinking or going to the pub, such as the cinema, concerts, sports, dining out, etc., but not everyone has the imagination or willingness to explore these as valid ways to enjoy yourself.Another objector wrote: ldquoDrinking in public places doesnrsquot cause a problem in itself. Issues arise when certain iniduals drink alcohol to excess in any setting.ldquoThe problem, in my view, wonrsquot be solved by a blanket ban on alcohol in public spaces. There are already laws to prevent antisocial behaviour but they need enforced.Police Scotland also provided a detailed response to the consultation. It reads: ldquoAlcohol bylaws are used within the three other local council areas within Lothian and Borders, namely East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian.ldquoBy having such bylaws in force it assists Police Scotland in reducing anti-social behaviour and violence both of which are known to have an association with drinking in public.ldquoCurrently the Scottish Borders area is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.NHS Borders, Borders Alcohol and Drug Partnership and Scottish Borders Children and Young Peoplersquos Leadership Group provided a joint response, which reads: ldquoAlcohol consumption can take place in our communitiesrsquo private space as well as within licensed premises.ldquoNot allowing people to drink in a public place will help to reduce the normalisation of alcohol being an ordinary commodity and builds communities and environments that supports a culture change and reduces exposure for our children and young people.ldquoPublic drinking can adversely affect the quality of le for residents and our communities.ldquoAlcohol Focus Scotland report that one in two Scots experience harm from anotherrsquos drinking and often this harm is experienced in public spaces .ldquoIn this study % had experienced harm to others in public places and this was mostlyexperienced by the younger age group .ldquoAlcohol bylaws can be used as an additional tool to reduce the nuisance and disorder normally associated with public drinking.ldquoLicensed premises are well regulated within the Scottish Borders and provide the opportunity to consume alcohol in a safe environment.ldquoThe Scottish Borders is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.Councillors will now be asked whether to conduct further consultation on two options: a blanket ban on public drinking to cover the whole of the Borders, or the introduction of an alcohol ban in certain areas of the Borders. Police Scotland has indicated it would prefer the first option, to ease the enforcement of the ban.Furthermore, councillors are asked to consider undertaking a pilot scheme in specic towns, which could then be used to gather further feedback from the public."},{"url":null,"title":"golden-granny-hilde-aims-fashion-success","story":"AN archery gold medal winning grandmother at the British Transplant Games is setting her sights on fashion.Hilde Paxton from Clovenfords, who had a liver transplant shortly after her th birthday, struck the bulls-eye at Newport earlier this year.And the -year-old is already preparing to defend her title next year by raising vital funds for her Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team.Hilde is hosting a fashion show on Saturday, November  in Galashiels.She told us: \"Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team has around  members from all over the east of Scotland who take part in the Transplant Games.\"An important part of being a member is helping to raise the funds required for sending members to the British Transplant Games.\"The Colours Fashion Team will take to the Focus Centre boardwalk on the Saturday for an evening of glamour and casual wear.Included in the pound ticket price is a complimentary glass of Prosecco on arrival.As well as the fashion show, there will also be a grand raffle and a licensed bar.Tickets for Hildes fashion show, which starts at .pm for pm, are available from the Salmon Inn and Focus Centre, Galashiels, the Bridge Inn and The Gt Shop, Peebles, or The Hub in Innerleithen."},{"url":null,"title":"top-up-tap-plans-galashiels","story":"GALASHIELS is set to become the first town in the Borders to receive an official top-up tap.Scottish Water has already installed the water stations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Ayr, Oban and Fort William as part of its Your Water, Your Le initiative.As well as providing healthy drinking water, the refill taps will also reduce the number of plastic bottles which are currently in circulation.Scottish Water now want to install the top-up tap in Market Place -

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council. It is felt at the moment that the draft in its entirety is not acceptable until this letter is lodged and any concerns we have are taken on board.ldquoNot everybody understood everything that was involved in the draft plan but time was needed to make sure not only all the community councillors were more familiar with the draft plan but we had heard from HBCP and Haddington residents.ldquoIt was felt in the past that at community council meetings not enough time had been dedicated to it, hence the reason why Tuesday night happened.When the controversial proposals were revealed, the local authority confirmed it was ldquoexploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.The new lsquoedge of centrersquo car park, dubbed a park and stride or a park and ride, would encourage people to walk or be bussed from Whittingehame Drive back into the town centre.No location has been confirmed for any new car park, although there have been concerns raised as to how it would impact upon community events such as Nungate Gala and the townrsquos fireworks.The long-stay car park at the townrsquos Tesco store, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could also become a short-stay car park.Joanna Gibson, HBCP chairwoman, outlined the grouprsquos feelings about the proposed scheme before non-community councillors were asked to leave the meeting ndash a decision that, according to East Lothian Council, was entirely down to the community council.A number of businesses feared they would not be able to operate through a y construction period. There were also worries that businesses would be forced to close and, with none moving in, it would result in a poorer High Street.Mrs Gibson said: ldquoWe do not think that this design has enough merit to counter the huge disruption of even phase one of the plan.ldquoThere were at least three plans at the initial consultations, why were none of the others considered  Perhaps within these plans we might have found a non-disruptive way to actually improve the town centre.ldquoThe shared space for events we believe will rarely be used as there does not seem to be any motivation or intentions, to our knowledge, to appoint someone to manage this.ldquoWe already have excellent event space outside the Corn Exchange offering indoor and outdoor event space and at Whittingehame Drive, and round the River Tyne where very successful community events are held.ldquoWe believe that parking is an important factor in retaining businesswe are to compete with the [proposed] new retail park [at Gateside] and survive and prosper.ldquoThis has also been the conclusion of many high street and town centre survival papers and studies worldwide.A council spokesman said: ldquoWe are continuing to develop proposals to improve the attractiveness, ality and accessibility of the town in support of the community and local businesses. This includes improved pedestrian and cycle access, as well as exploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.ldquoOur priorities are to protect and enhance the local environment while supporting the local economy.

The young who voted overwhelmingly to remain did so because they are internationally-minded, have come into contact with European students at college, have travelled more and are far more open-minded than their seniors. Older Remainers have a historical perspective which says to them that after the th century wars we want Europe to be together. Middle-aged folk simply think it is daft to be a small economic unit in the face of America and China to name but two.Marching for a second referendum is great and I hope it succeeds. but it looks like we are coming up to an election and it needs to be a Brexit versus Revoke election, a substitute for a referendum. It does not want to be an obfuscated Labour election, talking about nationalisation and the like, nor does it need to be a Tory give-away to the well-off election. It needs to be an election about leaving the EU or remaining in the EU.John Cruickshank, Whiting Bay, Isle of Arran.The SNP and the Greens will stand on manestos committed to seeking Indyref, and the SNP is expected tothe most MPs from Scotland. What happensin Scotland those parties with manestos opposed to Indyref poll more votes in total than the total of those parties in favour of Indyref  Should that, rather than the number of MPs ed for particular parties, be taken as the true expression of the sovereign will of the Scottish people, thus removing any justication for Indyref, and of course vice versathere are more votes in total for those parties seeking Indyref Alan Fitzpatrick, Dunlop.DAVID Williamsonbelieves that the Scottish Tory MPs are acting dutully in supporting Brexit. I think his view is questionable on ious grounds. First, the referendum on EU membership was advisory only, not binding. The Government was not obliged to shape its policy on the referendum result and on any showing the idea of initiating as massive a constitutional change as departure from the EU on the strength of a wafer-thin majority vote was absurd. In a parallel universe, a sensible government would have responded to the referendum result by conducting a serious and academically respectable investigation into the ious forms a ldquoBrexit might take and the likely results of each of them, and putting the findings before the electorate, before even initiating the process of leaving the EU. It is nobodyrsquos duty to support a misguided and mishandled policy that can only lead to disaster.Secondly, it is surely a first principle of parliamentary democracy that members are elected to serve their constituencies. Every one of our Tory MPs is going directly against the majority of the voters they represent in their sheep-like obedience to their party line: hardly an example of democracy in action.However, this issue is really academic, since none of the MPs in question is likely to remain in office beyond the forthcoming election.Derrick McClure, Aberdeen AB.YET another extension and delay to the farcical Brexit saga, this time to January , . The rest of the world must be looking on in astonishment at the ineptitude of our ldquodemocratic institutions and conclude that we are a complete basket case.This whole mess could have been settled once and for all by the end of this monththe EU had just acted as requested to by the PM and refused to change the October deadline.This would have resulted in Parliament having to vote the new deal through, leave without a deal or rescind Article , thus remaining in the EU. Unless a complete zealot one way or the other Irsquom sure the majority of the electorate, especially the business community , are so fed up with the whole process that they just want it finalised without further dithering by our so-called politicians, who as a group surely must be the worst privileged bunch to have occupied the green benches.As it is, on and on it goes and as the end of January approaches yet another extension could be requested and granted. And so the spiral of uncertainty continues.James Martin, Bearsden.AS the damage likely to be inflicted by leaving the EU becomes daily clearerit is even more horrying to re-read Saturdayrsquos front page headline, ldquoGive us a break: Public is fed up with Brexit delays . It seems that boredom and apathy among the electorate may yet do what no amount of rational discussion could and encourage Parliament to vote through any awful deal in order to end the uncertainty.This desire for a conclusion is obviously in the interests of the tax-avoiding billionaires, racists and delusional believers in the lies about the EU peddled by much of the press during the referendum campaign. It also accords with the views of the apathetic group who, unbelievably, did not vote in the referendum. What is lesscomprehensible is that a single Remain voter could feel this way. The damage already sustained from the vote is obvious, and is nothing compared to the social and economic damage likely to follow leaving the EU whatever deal is or is not reached.Most horrying of all is the attitude expressed by Lord Haugheyand by many otherbusiness leaders. They seem to prepared to accept any deal, however bad, whereas they claim they cannot cope with uncertainty. As the future is never certain, it is curious that they think leaving the EU will somehow make it more predictable. One has to suspect that for some, at least, in the business community, slackening of workplace, consumer and environmental protection outside the EU may actually be what they want.Lord Haughey goes further, and repeats the dreadful mantra about leaving the EU being a democratic decision which must be honoured. Even he must realise this is a nonsense a decision based on a gerrymandered electorate, illegal expenditure, lies and undeliverable promises must not be allowed to dictate our future.Dr RM Morris, Ellon.WITH the prospect of a General Election in the offing, political parties are beginning their campaigns. We now know what will be the centrepiece of the SNPrsquos campaign. Both the partyrsquos leader and deputy leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford and Kirsty Blackman, announced in television interviews in recent days that the choice before Scots would be to vote for Scotland ldquoin Brexit Britain or ldquoan independent Scotland remaining in the EU. To say that this is an untruth is to put it very mildly. The EU Commission and other EU representatives have made it very clear that Scotland, as part of the UK, will leave the EU as part of the UK.The SNP leadership knows this very well. Its claim that an independent Scotland would remain in the EU is an appeal to many Scots, like myself, who deplore the fact that the UK is leaving the EU. The SNP expects to make gains in any election, based on their appeal to anti-Brexit Scots. However, Scots need to be aware that SNP literature and word of mouth propaganda that claim that Scotland could ldquoremain in the EU is thoroughly dishonest. A separate Scotland could apply to join the EU ndash that is another matter. But Scotland is not a member state of the EU: it is a part of a member state, the UK. If that member state leaves, all of it leaves, including all of its constituent parts. A Scotland that had left the UK could not ldquoremain in the EU. That is not merely my view it is the view of the EUrsquos leadership.Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh EH.BREXIT chaos reigns, a major contributory factor being that next to no recognition has been given by the Conservative Government and its Brexiter supporters to the fact that in the referendum Leave won a majority of votes over Remain amounting to a tiny . per cent of the votes cast.In that context a hard Brexit with the alternative of No Deal should have been absolutely unthinkable. Boris Johnsonrsquos isive strategy has resulted in the citizens of the UK being unable to come together to heal the schisms not only within but between our nations.Who would have thought that it would be the Conservative and ldquoUnionist Party which would do such potentially irreparable damage to the unity of our country  The legs on which the Union stands are shaking, even showing signs of crumbling, and that party must accept a signicant element of the responsibility. In spite of all the talk of how important the Union is to the likes of Theresa May, polls have shown it means little in any meaningful sense to a dwindling number of the English.I campaigned for a No vote in  only to see the result being thrown away by so-called Unionists in the party of that name.

It would be up to John Bercow, the Speaker, to decide on whether to allow any amendment to be debated and voted on.Ahead of the debate, there has to be discussion of how to timetable the bill as all its stages are set to be processed today.Some Labour whips are said to be pushing for their party to vote against the Governmentrsquos proposed timetable motion, hoping that Mr Johnson would pull the bill at that point.:Nicola Sturgeon calls out Laura Kuenssberg over Scottish independence rally tweetIt is also unclear how the Government would proceedan amendment to, say, allow EU citizens the vote was successfully included in the bill.

But the one that may be most instructive, as the parties line up with their manestos, and we attempt to get some settled verdict on Brexit and its economic consequences, is the th anniversary of the final day of the Wall Street Crash, which marked the start of the Great Depression.Despite the attention devoted to this period, which affected every developed nation for more than a decade, and made the austerity programmes of the past few years look like Viv Nicholson singing Big Spender in a luxury car showroom, no one agrees, even now, on the lessons to be learnt from it.Reckless speculation, easy credit, an asset price bubble, government intervention, protectionism and failures of the banking system were the main components, but even so some economists argue that the Wall Street Crash wasnrsquot the real cause of the Depression .If all of that seems vaguely familiar, itrsquos because it happened again notably  years ago, on Black Monday, when the Dow Jones had its largest-ever one-day drop and . trillion dollars was wiped off the world economy. If that seems too distant, itrsquos just  years ago this month that Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual, and the bail-out of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Those were the US government-backed outfits which were supposed to provide security for the mortgage market ndash and were themselves set up in the s under the New Deal designed to end the Depression.And where are we after the Great Recession the  crash sparked  Practically nothing seems to have changed. The nationalised banks are back in private ownership, continuing to pay enormous bonuses and generally behaving as they did before. The UKrsquos national debt, . per cent of GDP in , is now . per cent of GDP, or about pound. trillion. About  per cent of bonds issued globally ndash  trillion worth ndash actually guarantee a loss, something that may remind you of the creative packaging of subprimedebt that kicked off the last crisis. A decade on, interest rates and growth are still on the floor, deflation looms, and monetary policy is broken.The response of the political parties to this state of affairs ishellip to promise to spend money like water. Unsurprisingly, Jeremy Corbynrsquos plans are the worst: Labourrsquos proposed nationalisations have been costed at pound billion just to set up, even before the companies concerned start losing money, as state-run firms tend to while there will be lots more money for all the usual suspects, such as the NHS, schools, and public sector workers.But even the parties that donrsquot advocate the full Venezuela treatment have absurdly expensive plans. The SNPrsquos fiscal estimates, so critical when it comes to Brexit or Westminster, go sharply into starry-eyed optimism when it suits them. The Tories, who correctly insisted that austerity was necessary, are now finding money all over the placefor plans of dubious value, like HS, or Borisrsquos peculiar enthusiasm for very expensive bridges.The battle of economic ideas that used to ide the parties has been displaced by political issues such as Brexit or Scottish independence. These, of course, have economic elements, but they are intrinsically unknowable and cheerfully ignored, skewed, inflated or played down by all sides, because their commitment is partisan, rather than an assessment of economic reality.We hear endlessly of the likely catastrophic impact of a no-deal Brexit, for example, but very little about Germanyrsquos current industrial crisis, the continuing fissures in the Eurozone, or the fact that both Italy and Francersquos real economy debt puts them on the verge of bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the Tories are already promising to spend hypothetical benefits of trade deals that donrsquot yet exist.Alas, any election will be dominated by political issues, such as the competence of the leaders, accusations of obstruction, claims to represent ldquothe people and, God help us, Brexit and independence. All the parties, on current form, will offer the Moon on a stick, with no regard to the cost. Every party, even the incumbents, will also go heavily for the first of the campaign priorities James Carville devised for Bill Clinton: ldquoChange, versus more of the same. Itrsquos a shame that the second message Carville realised you had to push to win an election credibly ndash ldquoItrsquos the economy, stupid ndash wonrsquot get a look in."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10606509.jpg?type=article-full","title":"new-poll-reveals-support-snp-scottish-independence","story":"Our latest survey of readerrsquos views found that more than half, . per cent, intend to vote for Nicola Sturgeonrsquos party at the General Election on December , followed by .% for the Conservatives and .% for the Liberal Democrats.Just .% of our readers questioned in the pollintend to vote for Labour, who have suffered a bruisingtime in Scotland in recent years.However, % of people who responded to the poll said they had changed their political allegiance since the last General Election, although they did not specy to which party.:Iain Macwhirter: Rude awakening ahead in the nightmare before ChristmasThe poll of more than , readers also found that they back staying in the EU and want to see an independent Scotland.If there was a second referendum on leaving the EU, % said they would back remain compared to .% who would leave with just .% undecided.This is a considerable move from the % Leave % Remain vote in  across the UK, and higher than the % Remain to % Leave vote in Scotland.In a second Scottish Independence referendum, almost % back Yes to Scotland becoming a fully-fledged country compared to a No vote of %, with fewer than  % undecided.This is a considerable turnaround for the % No vote, % Yes vote at the referendum in .:Nicola Sturgeon calls out Laura Kuenssberg over Scottish independence rally tweetTrust in politicians at Westminster is hard to find among our readers ndash with almost % saying they did not trust MPs.

For it is very clear that the uncertainties around both Brexit and the potential for a second independence referendum, are factors acting as a drag on Scotland’s economic performance. But that doesn’t tell the whole story.Last week the respected Fraser of Allander Institute issued an economic commentary looking at Scottish performance in the context of the United Kingdom as a whole. They pointed to evidence of the negative impact of political uncertainty: business investment in the UK having now been negative in five of the past six quarters, and both consumer confidence and risk-appetite amongst businesses being weak.A deal with the EU will, according to Fraser of Allander, help lt some of the fog of uncertainty that has hung over the Scottish and UK economies in recent times, and deliver a short-term economic boost. The impact of Brexit in the longer term will depend upon the exact terms of the future relationship with the EU.: Fraser of Allander report paints mixed picture for Scottish business: Extra income from Scots tax rises ‘wiped out by slow wage growth’If we burrow deeper into the economic commentary’s findings, we learn that there are specically Scottish concerns which cannot be attributed solely to Brexit. Scotland’s annual growth rate is now just . per cent, compared to that of the UK as a whole at . per cent. Since , the Scottish economy has grown at four per cent compared to five per cent in the UK and seven per cent in the EU. And, while some of the recent weakness in the Scottish economy can be pinned on Brexit uncertainty, the actual trend in activity since early  is broadly in line with the period between  and . So even before the EU referendum, the Scottish economy was underperforming the UK average, and that trend is simply continuing.Tens of thousands without jobsThe employment figures tell a similar story. In the three months to August, Scottish unemployment jumped . per cent, and employment fell by . per cent. This means that Scottish unemployment is higher than the UK average, and the employment rate at . per cent substantially below that of the UK at . per cent. That represents tens of thousands of adults of working age who could be making an economic contribution and paying taxes, but are not currently doing so.Whilst it may be very convenient for SNP ministers to blame all of Scotland’s economic woes on Brexit, the facts simply do not fit this narrative. There is something  going on here, above and beyond our departure from the EU.When we look at business confidence in Scotland, political uncertainty is being caused not just by doubts about the future post-Brexit, but concerns about the prospect of a second independence referendum. With no certainty as to what currency we might use post-independence, how we would fill the fiscal gap of £. billion, or what our trading relationship would be with our largest export market in the rest of the UK, it is no wonder that Nicola Sturgeon’s relentless drive for indyref is having a negative impact both on business and on consumer confidence.Financial executives filled with horrorDespite all this there are key strengths to the Scottish economy. There was a palpable sense of positivity and optimism at the Scottish Financial Enterprise annual dinner last week, with businesses across the sector showcasing dynamism, innovation and investment in skills. This is a sector where Scotland’s reputation has always been strong, and there is no sign of that changing anytime soon.For many of those I spoke to at that dinner, whilst Brexit uncertainty is a concern, it is issues closer to home that they regard as more of a threat. The prospect of an independent Scotland running a dferent currency from the UK is one which fills financial industry executives with horror, and would inevitably lead to a substantial exodus of capital, and with it thousands of well-paid jobs.The SNP’s tax regime, ensuring that anyone earning above £, pays higher taxes than the rest of the UK, is also an ongoing concern. For young ambitious, talented, highly mobile iniduals, levels of taxation are a factor in determining where they accept job offers, andwe continue to see a growing ergence between Scottish tax rates and those where in the UK then the impact on Scottish business is bound to be negative.Fraser of Allander concludes in its report that there is need for a more open discussion of the underlying growth dynamics of the Scottish economy. That is a debate that the Scottish Conservatives are up for. Our Scottish Future Growth Council has already published a suite of proposals on how to improve productivity in our economy, and will shortly be producing its second report on shting our economic performance into a higher gear. Bringing in serious measures to tackle our economic underperformance, rather than simply blaming the Brexit bogeyman, is what is going to make a real dference in the future.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"when a focus group heard this fact about brexit there was horrified silence alex cole hamilton msp","story":"The public are being duped over Brexit by both the Tories and the SNP, writes Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP.Somewhere, in a windowless room of a national opinion polling organisation, the answers offered by a recent focus group uncovered a worrying reality.When asked a series of questions about Boris Johnson’s new Brexit ‘deal’ the carefully selected cross-section of the UK public demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding as to what is actually going on. The research discovered that almost universally, those asked thought that the ‘deal’ being examined at Westminster represented not just the terms of our withdrawal from the European Union but the entirety our future trading and political relationship with the bloc.When told that this was just the beginning and that Brexit itself would trigger years of detailed, high-stakes negotiations and trade talks– the response was a “horried silence”.It demonstrates the mistaken, yet widely held belief that “getting Brexit done” will conclude with the passage of a withdrawal agreement. Yet in reality, the wrangling, the double-dealing and the persistent threat of crashing out without a deal after the transition period are set to go on and on and on.: Brexit: Boris Johnson is learning same lessons as Theresa May – Ian Swanson: Brexit: England seems to be declaring independence from UK – Angus RobertsonPart of the cause of this confusion is that very few political parties are being straight with the public right now, either about what is going on in the Brexit endgame, or how they feel about it.Take the Prime Minister. In , Theresa May proposed what was, effectively, the same withdrawal agreement as the one on the table right now. She was derided for it by both Boris Johnson and the Brexiteer wing of the Conservative Party. DoublethinkNow he is at the helm, Johnson has discovered the unassailable boundaries of Brexit and has reheated the same solution to the Irish border problem. Northern Ireland will be both simultaneously inside and outside of the EU customs union, depending on your point of view – “Schrödinger’s Ulster” as the commentator Alex Massie recently put it.Scottish Tories have rushed to embrace this policy and with it the doublethink of their new leader. When Theresa May first proposed special treatment for Northern Ireland in its relationship with the EU, Ruth Davidson and David Mundell threatened to resign their positions in response to the threat they believed it represented to the Union.But a poll of Tory members earlier this year suggested that delivering Brexit was more important to them than preventing Scottish independence. The self-proclaimed s of the Union are now pedalling a policy that dramatically heightens the risk of another Scottish border poll and all that comes with it.The mask is beginning to slip for the SNP as well. For three years, Nicola Sturgeon has sought to court Remain voters who voted No in . She’s been desperate to point to independence as a leboat back to the EU . But the First Minister’s ‘stop Brexit’ credentials are starting to ring rather hollow.It emerged last week that her party spent considerably more money chasing , votes in the Shetland by-election than they did campaigning for . million votes in the EU referendum. And people have forgotten that it took them nearly two years to join the campaign for a referendum on the final terms of Brexit. Now that a second referendum might just make it into the Withdrawal Billthey have gone strangely quiet on that front. Instead they appeared to have opted for a swashbuckling push for a snap General Election out of what appears to be a narrow self-interest.No wonder people find politics infuriating right now. They just want political parties to be straight with them about the seismic choices we face as a nation. That starts by reminding them in no uncertain terms that the best deal we could ever hope to strike with the EU is the one we currently enjoy as a full and active member and that the best way to “get Brexit done” is to do away with Brexit completely.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"general election 2019 right to hold independence referendum to dominate scots election push","story":"Nationalist demands for a second referendum on independence will be at the heart of the coming election campaign.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford insisted that Scotland’s right to “determine its own future” will drive the party’s election push as MSPs last night backed a December election.The UK government has so far refused to grant the section  order that would give Holyrood the power to hold a second referendum on leaving the UK.But with polls suggesting the SNP are poised to build on the  seats – out of  – they hold in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will argue this strengthens the case for another vote on independence.Mr Blackford told MPs in the Commons yesterday that the SNP welcomes the opportunity of an election.“We will reflect on everything that’s happened since  when  Scottish ­Conservatives were temporarily elected to this house,” he said.“Because every step of the way they voted against Scotland’s interests, they have given no consideration to the fact that every single local authority area in Scotland voted to Remain.”Mr Blackford said that during the  independence referendum, Scots were told that a vote to remain in the UK would secure the country’s place in Europe.He said: “Remember that we were told this was going to be a union of equals, that Scotland was going to be respected. What has happened “Scotland in the EU referendum voted by  per cent to remain inEurope.“Our government, our parliament has sought to give voice to that.“We’ve published document after document, Scotland’s place in Europe, where we have sought a compromise with the UK government.“And at every step of the way, whether it was the previous PM or this one, we’ve been ignored. I’ve repeatedly made the point and I make no apology for making it here again today, we on these benches are simply not prepared to sit back and allow Scotland to be taken out of the European Union against its will.“So on that basis, Mr Speaker, I welcome the opportunity of an election because, make no mistake, the election that’s coming is going to be the right of Scotland to determine its own future.”Ms Sturgeon is seeking to hold a second referendum on independence next year and legislation is currently going through the Scottish Parliament that would allow this to happen. But power over the con­stitution in the UK is reserved to Westminster and Prime Minister Boris Johnson, like his predecessor Theresa May, has insisted he will not grant this.The Labour leadership has hinted that it could be ready to back a second referendum on independence in exchange for SNP support to help prop up a Labour administration in a hung Parliament, although Jeremy Corbyn insisted this may not happen in the early years of a government headed by him.Ms Sturgeon this month warned the Labour leader not to even bother “picking up the phone” seeking her co-operation to form a government unless he was ready to grant a section  order.Together with the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, Labour will use the campaign to highlight their opposition to independence. Polls have suggested the Tories, who took  seats in Scotland in the  general election, could lose most of those seats this time round.With Brexit still unpopular in Scotland the SNP will be hoping to make gains when voters go to the polls.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"pro indy artists desire to please pathetic says leading scots composer","story":"Scotland#s leading classical composer has accused #dozens of cultural figures of harbouring #a pathetic desire to please those in control# by issuing their own declaration for Scottish independence.Sir James MacMillan condemned the likes of crime author Val McDermid, writer Liz Lochhead, actor Brian Cox, rapper Darren McGarvey and musician Pat Kane for \u2028losing a “thirst to speak truth to power”.He said the group of artists and creatives were instead guilty of “a meek and mild compliance” and asked why an artistic desire to shock the establishment had “become the desire to bend over for them”.Writing in the American social, cultural and political magazine National Review, Sir James, , claimed that the SNP administration at Holyrood was “keen for culture to be the tool of politics and is working hard to achieve widespread, general compliance.”He insisted that the best thing for Scottish culture would be for the Scottish Government “to get out of our faces.”The Ayrshire-born composer suggested that those who backed the declaration had “forgotten that nationalist movements throughout history have sought control over culture and heritage”.He added: “It’s odd – people in the arts, who often pride themselves on being free thinkers and anti-establishment, have, in Scotland, become something .“Gone is the thirst to speak truth to power. In its place is a meek and mild compliance, a pathetic desire to please those in control. Art should not bend the knee to governments or ruling castes. “Since when did the artistic desire to shock the establishment become the desire to bend over for them ”Actress Elaine C Smith, singer Karine Polwart, poet Michael Pedersen, author Andrew O’Hagan and playwright Stephen Greenhorn were among the other cultural figures to back the independence blueprint, published days before the SNP’s autumn conference in Aberdeen earlier this month.The declaration stated: “It is our belief that the best option now open to the Scottish people is for Scotland to become an independent country. “The alternative is to accept that its fate would remain in the hands of others and that the Scottish people would relinquish their right to decide their own destiny.”Pat Kane, frontman with the band Hue and Cry, said: “Of course artists should keep their distance from existing governments.

Now, how about a bit of investment in tidal and hydrogen generation. The Sullom Voe four dual-fuel gas turbine generators could be updated and expanded to eight. That should easily supply power for immediate use and cut our carbon footprint in half.Let us see how the Green loonies ponder this one I have just crunched a few figures! The cost of the interconnector would pay for four Shetland power stations. Now one gas-fired would leave acool £, million for research and education. Rock on Viking Energy and goodbye.In Ian Tinkler’s mind the phrase “Green loonies” is meaningful. Can anyone  explain who his loonies are, or do they only exist in his imagination   If the phrase is only meaningful to Ian it is dficulty to see how “sanity is taking over at last”.Very appropriate for the idiots who wasted £ million SCT funds and now want to throw £ million more at windfarm Shetland. Characterising those behind Viking Energy as silly, mad or idiotic is simplistic, inaccurate and unhelpful.Some, but certainly not all, of the backersand approvers were incorrectly motivated by honestly held environmental concerns.Tom Morton’s name springs to mind.Ian Tinkler’s phrase, “Green loonies”, does nothing, however, to capture the aice that motivated some of the others who, vocally or secretly, also backed the scheme.Neither does Ian’s phrase address the  “development-at-all-costs” notion that the council must always be on a mission to find and back the next big thing.Their job should instead be to see things are fairly considered.Ian may be right to argue the inter-connector is unaffordable, that Shetland needs an intermediary gas-fired power station # possibly en-route to a publicly owned eco-grid # but he’s foolish to garble so important a message.An independent commission may be needed to look at how Shetland’s future energy needs can best be met.The council could have a role in calling for one.And Ian Tinkler can retain his self-stimulating role in calling others silly names at random for his own pleasure.As for “snowflake”, well bless his cotton socks.Would he could stick to his point.In all seriousness, I wince when I read the word ‘ loonies’ in these columns.

I could go on but the Big Girls Blouses of the PR brigade may be offended. That would be tough on Girly Swots.!!! Sorry for the windup folks, I do not suffer pretentious fools all that well.Side comment : I believe when Sullom Voe, was being planned, an arrangement was negotiated where SV could supply gas, via pipeline, to the power station here in Lerwick, at very little cost, thus the cost of power to the people of Shetland, becoming one,not the only, cheapest source of energy for the consumer. However, the get out clause, the Hydro-Board, asked BP could the guarantee % supply  No surprise, BP said # No. #. That being said, we, Shaetlanders# were denied a cheaper cost of energy and a cost of living. I believe. Could this arrangement still be in the pipeline as an alternative to Viking Energyin providing a cheap source of energy Well Ian, that was almost an apology laced with get # out clauses.!!Making references to the so called PR brigade and Big Girls’ Blouses does nothing to assuage people who deliver their opinions in reasonable, measured tones.To attack with great relish says a great deal more about the attacker than the attacked. One can very readily understand why so much intolerance in the world makes it an unsafe place.Being proud of such a weakness merely serves to compound the problem.With patience and a large slice of contrite thinking, things could repair and meaningful exchanges COULD take place.Roll on.Since May . The  MWe plant has four  MW General Electric Frame  gas turbines . It may be more cost-effective to modernise and expand this plant at Sullom than build a gas pipe to Lerwick. Unless I am mistaken a connecting power line is cheaper and less environmentally damaging than a pipeline. If Shetland ever gets its renewable act together this plant would act as the backup power station until a non-fosil fuel plant was established. A tidal generation would be the obvious solution with hydrogen back up and storage used for transport and energy storage.Thank you Ian, for your comments. directly coming from Sullom Voe Haydn makes a worthwhile point.

I suspect the staff periodically consider such issues and wouldn’t be troubled by the prospect of being considered “Big Girls Blouses”or indeed “pretentious fools” were they to cut less slack.It is also possible to become desensitised, even to such annoyances as the distracting sound of a dentist’s excessive drill.The profit motive aside, I can’t see the subsea cable being preferable to Shetland becoming self sufficient through sustainable renewables..."},{"url":null,"title":"electrical engineer electrician at scale aq ","story":"• Experience working within aquaculture is desirable but not essential as training will be given.• Full driving licence is essential.• ScaleAQ offer a competitive salary, private healthcare and training development opportunities.ScaleAQ is the result of  years of experience and consists of Steinsvik, Aqualine and AquaOptima.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government.

She said: “Traditional is my more natural method of singing, so it was abig challenge to go for this competition. #Kirsteen Grant, the conductor of Glasgow Islay Choir, has been a massive help to me.#It hasn#t sunk in yet that I have won. I#ve had a million things going on, but I#m sure over the next few days, once I#ve had some proper sleep, I can start to savour it.”Claire, husband Donald, and their three youngest children were all making the move north.“I won my first Gold at home and the second one in what I#d consider my second home. It#s all lovely timing,” added Claire, who topped off her successful mòd by being part of a winning quartet in a further competition on Friday.Meanwhile, a good luck message in Gaelic from favourite team Partick Thistle helped inspire men#s Gold Medal winner Ruairidh Alasdair MacLennan.Ruairidh Alasdair — a -year-old BBC sports reporter from Glasgow, who has family connections to South Uist — is a long-time season ticket holder at Firhill.He said the fact the mòd was in his home city had prompted him to take part this year following a -year gap.“I#m surprised and delighted to have won — particularly in my home city as well,” he said.“I hadn#t competed since I won the boys# silver medal in . And you know how it is — the more time goes on the less likely you are to go back to it.#But we worked hard at it, and it has gone much better than I expected.#He added: “I#m very fortunate to have had two such dedicated tutors help me along — not just to help me win the competition but even to get me singing at all.“My mother, Ishabel T Macdonald, has been involved in the traditional music scene for many years, and over the years she mentored a number of other medallists. I was fortunate to be taught by my mother, and also Kenna Campbell. I can only put on record my thanks to them.” We would like to apologise for an error in the caption which appeared on the front page of this week#s edition # Friday th October. The caption wrongly stated that Isabelle Bain and Crisdean MacKenzie were the winners of the Royal National Mòd Gold Medals when the winners were Claire Macaulay and Ruairidh Alasdair MacLennan as detailed above.Isabelle Bain won the ladies# Traditional Gold Medal, while Crisdean MacKenzie won the men#s Traditional Gold Medal.

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

The UUP was split during the referendum but officially campaigned to Remain.However, with Sinn Feins seven MPs not taking their seats at Westminster and the Stormont Assembly not sitting, the DUPs  MPs have been the dominant voice for Northern Ireland, with independent Lady Sylvia Hermon the only other representative for the region in the House of Commons.Brexit has brought the constitutional status of Northern Ireland back to the fore, with disagreement over the future of the border having already sunk two proposed withdrawal deals.Fears have been voiced over dissident republican violence in the event of a hard border, while PM Boris Johnsons most recent proposal of an effective trade border down the Irish Sea sparked outrage among unionists and accusations of betrayal from loyalists.

Gender equality in wages is much more prevalent in the public sector than in the private sector.\"However, as public sector wage increases have been limited to % over recent years, full-time female wages have been hit.\"This means that the positive gender pay gap in full-time earnings may be short-lived,\" he said."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Therefore, John decided that any money raised would go to the same charity.Between both the coffee morning and John’s sponsored silence over pound, was raised and a few late donations have been filtering in.Speaking to the Derry News at the weekend John said of the challenge: “I didn’t speak until I came out of the school at  o’clock. It was tough enough. My wee girls were saying, ‘try not to break it’, but it was hard because I’m used to rambling on.“The principal was taunting away at me, saying ‘John, ye haven’t seen the caretaker ’ and I would shake my head, then he’d go, ‘do ye know where he is ’ and I would just shake my head again.“And someone of the kids, the primary  pupils, would say ‘gone speak to me’, so they were doing a bit of taunting too. But they couldn’t break me.”John has his sights set on another charity fundraiser after Christmas when he plans on walking from Derry to Buncrana and back again - he says Macmillan will most likely be the beneficiary again.Sadly, a number of John’s close family have had cancer and he appreciates the emotional, physical and financial support the charity offers.“They’re known as the ‘little angels’ and they do a great job. If you have somebody belonging to you suffering with cancer then they put them at ease.“The work they do is amazing,you ever have any issues you’re able to phone them and they come straight away.“I’m happy to see this money go to them because it will go towards helping more families in Derry.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Department of Education has however told this paper that a petition signed by parents and pupils at the school will be taken into account by the Permanent Secretary. Parents were “devastated’ when first informed of proposals to close the Coshquin school after a letter was sent out asking them to attend a meeting with Education Authority officials back in April. Parents and schoolchildren from Groarty P.S. then hand delivered letters to education chief, Derek Baker, when he visited Derry imploring him to reconsider. googletag.cmd.push Due to uncertainty surrounding the future of the school, a number of parents have taken the dficult decision to transfer their children to another school. One such parent, Diana McLaughlin, whose son and daughter attended the school, said: We actually ended up leaving the school. The uncertainty was a bit too much for us. I didnt need the hardship of worrying about finding an appropriate school later so I moved my son to St.Patricks where we have other children in the family there. Her son, Haiden, misses Groarty IPS terribly and found the transition to a new school very dficult but is now settling in well. Mrs McLaughlin added: With transfer tests looming, we really wanted to get them settled before all that work kicked off. She paid tribute to the hard-working staff at Groarty IPS who had a great relationship with the children and persevered in trying circumstances. Over the weekend, a spokesperson for the Department of Education stated said the Department’s formal consultation period does not close until the th November. “Whilst the Education Authority’s consultation process closed in June, no decision willbe taken on the future of the school until closure of this statutory stage of the process. “The Department has received a petition from parents and pupils and this will be considered along with the Case for Change before a decision is taken by the Permanent Secretary in the continued absence of a Minister.” History The school has a capacity for  pupils and it was anticipated that by transforming from a controlled primary school to a controlled integrated primary school in  that numbers were going to swell. Since then however pupil numbers each year have fluctuated between  and  – that may be less for the   school year given recent departures. The school has been a part of the local community for over  years. It attained Integrated status in  and is the only school with Integrated status on the West Bank of the city. The Education Authority’s consultation document made reference to the other integrated school in the city, Oakgrove Integrated P.S., which operates “near to or over capacity” and therefore couldn’t accommodate pupils from Groarty P.S. It does however highlight other schools closest to Groarty P.S., such as Irish Medium School Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige and Catholic Maintained Schools St Eithne’s and Holy Family P.S., which the EA says have many unfilled places. The EA argues that the school’s enrolment falls “well short” of the Sustainable Schools Policy criteria for primary schools, set at  pupils for a rural school and  pupils for an urban school. And says in addition there are more than two year groups within a classroom as the school operates as a three teacher school. The EA has a duty to encourage, facilitate and promote shared education. And Groarty CIPS has over the past number of years engaged in Shared Education with Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige. Both schools previously made a joint submission under the Shared Education Campuses Programme for a shared campus. However, in consideration of the numbers of Groarty CIPS and the proposed campus, the Education Authority did not endorse Groarty CIPS’s submission as it would “not provide for a sustainable education campus.” At the time staff, parents and pupils of the two schools staged a protest march.

Specic to the introduction of this equipment, we will be creating three jobs within the team, to include two regional sales managers and a production manager.“This project is running in tandem with our ambitious expansion to a new poundm facility on the outskirts of Strabane that will house our company’s entire business operations and incorporate the introduction of the new production line for the Structured Insulated Panels .”Chair of the Local Action Group of the Derry and Strabane Rural Partnership, Councillor Jim McKeever, said: “Our Rural Business Investment Scheme has exceeded all expectations and has played a vital role in our local economy and made a signicant impact on our rural community.“We were inundated with applications throughout each of the six rounds of funding, and we worked meticulously with applicants to guide them through each stage of the application process, ensuring they had their business plan developed, match funding secured, planning permission granted for any building works, and the necessary quotations in place for equipment or services.“This attention to detail has allowed our scheme to allocate all of our budget, as well as exceed our targets in terms of numbers of businesses supported and actual job creation.”The Northern Ireland Rural Development Programme - is funded by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the European Union .

It may have taken longer than expected for Junior to get off the mark at his new club, his first goal coming against Longford in the EA Sports League Cup at the start of April, but since then he has been one of the stars in this new look Candystripes team. Junior has provided some memorable moments along the way, his hat trick at Turners Cross amongst them, not to mention scoring the most spectacular disallowed goal in Brandywell history when his unbelievable overhead kick against Finn Harps was disallowed for high feet. Still, there was little,any, talk about Junior winning the Golden Boot going into the last game of the season until an early double against Harps on Friday night left him tied with Dundalks Patrick Hoban. There was a  alarm during the games on Friday night with word coming through from Oriel Park that Hoban had sneaked back into the lead after scoring against St. Patricks Athletic, but that was quickly deemed an own goal by goalkeeper Brendan Clarke. Within minutes of that news coming through, Junior took the ball out of the sky from Jamie McDonaghs pass and fired in his third to go clear in the scoring charts, and with Hoban being substituted, the privilege was his. It was a fitting end to a memorabkle night for the forward. Before the game I wasnt really thinking about the top scorer,” he admitted. “It was about winning the game, getting into Europe and thats be a massive achievement for us. But obviously when I got two goals at the start of the game, I thought I could get another one and who knows what could happen  Thats what happened so Im very happy about that.At first I heard hehad scored one and the boys were trying to get me a goal but I thought its just not going to be. As long as we won and got into Europe I was happy but its a massive bonus and Im just happy. Its crazy.” googletag.cmd.push UnknownJunior was vehnturing into the unknown somewhat when he first arrived at Derry, but he quickly adapted, with his managers faith in him helping settle a player who was not only new to the league but to the city. I literally came here and bought into the idea the gaffer had,” he continued.“His plan was to finish in the European spots and thankfully weve achieved that. For me personally, I thought I probably started the season a bit slow. Obviously it was a new team, a new league and playing out wide was dferent. But I adapted and the boys made it easy for me.“I learned when to make runs and movements when certain players had the ball and they made it so easy for me to adapt and get used to the tempo and the way football is played here.“Thats what we set out to do. Inidually I thought I could get a few goals and help the team out and its been great but to finish top scorer is amazing.Not many players have the experience of scoring a hat trick in front of a packed Brandywell, but Junior, who hita treble at Cork City eralier in the season, will remember that feeling for a long time. It felt great, especially at home as my last one was at Cork and the atmosphere wasnt the same,” he explained. “At home it was brilliant, it was electric, Im so happy.Everyone is so happy and buzzing. Its just amazing. We set out to finish on a high and thankfully we done that. It was a tough game but we worked hard for each other and Im delighted.”Junior has played in a number of dferent postions over the course of the -game season, but he has never complained, becoming a real team player for the Candystripes. Im used to playing up front but Ive enjoyed playing on the wing because football here is played properly,” he stated. “Football is on the floor and it just made it easier for me to settle in and adapt my game. I did the defensive stuff as well. Ive enjoyed it and its been brilliant. Ive really enjoyed it. The boys made it easy for me. Its been amazing.“Coming here, I didnt really know what to expect but its been a good season overall. Its been amazing and Im just happy.  Big decisionEvery Derry City fan will be waiting anxiously to discoverJunior will come back to the Brandywell next season, but it all depends on a number of factors, one of which is Colchester United. I havent really thought about whats next, Junior admitted. “Ive just been focused on the games and getting into Europe so I havent really thought much about the future. Anything can happen. I dont know whats going to happen but Im just so delighted with the win.Off the pitch its been good. Ive always said that everyone in the city has been brilliant with me. Going out, everyone has been friendly and its just been a friendly environment and I havent had any trouble since Ive been here. Its been great.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A thumping th minute point from Emmett McGuckin put Adrian Cush’s side three points ahead and they were full value for it. Glen, led by skipper Danny Tallon and young gun Alex Doherty, staged a late comeback but the closing stages saw Sunday’s decider, in front of over , fans, end in controversy as the Watties went in search of an equaliser. Shane Heavron squandered a stoppage time free for an insurance point but as the clock ticked towards the end of the allotted extra four minutes, Connor Carville built from a short kick-out. Referee John Joe Cleary seemed to allow Glen one last attack. A final roll of the dice. Connlan Bradley advanced and when Danny Tallon was awarded a free outside the ‘’ he elected to work the ball short. Yet, still play continued. As Glen patiently worked the ball into a scoreable position, the final whistle sounded. As Magherafelt’s celebrations ignited, Ciaran McFaul’s kick seemed to go over the bar but it didn’t count. Glen’s protests fell on deaf ears as a sea of red and white engulfed Celtic Park. While Glen can feel aggrieved at not being given a few additional seconds, they played second fiddle to a cool, calm and collected Magherafelt side for almost  minutes of this decider. The zip that tore Slaughtneil to shreds was absent and once Magherafelt got to grips with the game, it appeared that Glen would need to find the net to land the silver in their first ever final. For the first time in the campaign, Jude Donnelly’s side settled first. After securing possession from the throw-in, they played keep ball for a full three minutes before Emmett Bradley passed to Danny Tallon for the opening score. Ethan and Jack Doherty interchanged before Paddy McLarnon fouled and Paul Gunning doubled the lead. It was the start Glen needed to play the game on their own terms but Magherafelt didn’t flinch.  Wins over Coleraine and their second-half grind against Banagher left them battle-hardened.  From the resultant kick-out Shane Heavron caught brilliantly but when he passed to his brother Danny over the top they looked like carving out an opening. The advantage wasn’t given by referee Cleary, play was called back and Shane fired over from the free. When the industrious John Young got inside Jack Doherty and was fouled, Heavron’s second free levelled the game.  In the th minute, Emmett McGuckin fed Shane Heavron but his low shot lacked conviction and Oisin Hegarty’s foot presented a goal, with Alex Doherty kicking over the first of his four points at the end of a counter-attack. When Paul Gunning hoovered up the break from the kick-out, Doherty booted over another score and Glen were - to - ahead. It was then that Magherafelt began to turn the screw in the game. They hemmed Glen into their own half. The Heavrons were off target and Antone McElhone hit the post but when goalkeeper Mullan-Young fluffed a kick-out, Glen were on the defensive and Cahir McCabe’s push on Shane Heavron handed the Rossa dead-ball specialist the chance to level matters after  minutes. An Emmett Bradley catch led to a Tallon point on the run and Glen were ahead. They could’ve opened a four point lead when Gunning and Emmett Bradley combined. Ethan Doherty was in on goal but the angle favoured Odhraacuten Lynch who stood up until the last minute to make the save. Seconds later, Emmett McGuckin swivelled his hips to buy space before kicking an equaliser. From the kick-out, McGuckin flicked to Danny Heavron, who passed to Antone McElhone for a point. With Glen ‘keeper Callum Mullan-Young struggling with his kick-outs, with a lack of movement outfield and midfield trio of McFaul, Dougan and Bradley unable to won the aerial battle, Glen’s grip on the cup began to slip. Heavron cut out a miscued kick-out to set-up John Young for a point. A further miskick saw Conor Kearns in on goal but Carville’s tackle saved Glen’s bacon. A second turnover of the half from Fergal Duffin began a breakaway, with Danny Heavron setting up his brother Shane for his only effort from play and Magherafelt were - to - ahead at the break. Glen needed an impetus and when Ciaran McFaul grabbed the throw-in, he gave Glen an early spark and Danny Tallon swung a long-range point. The story of the half was Magherafelt’s ability to hold Glen at arm’sand with Odhraacuten Lynch’s assured kicking, they had control of the game.  While Glen ran into Magherafelt’s perfectly laid trap and forced passes that weren’t on, their opponents were squeaky clean in possession. It was all about precision. Magherafelt’s decision to start Conor McCluskey on Jack Doherty was a masterstroke. He constantly forced Glen on the back foot. He added a point but once again Alex Doherty, this time with a crisp left footed effort, fired over to put three in it again. But Magherafelt’s game was a more polished version of their  version. Shane Heavron’s pass put Emmett McGuckin in and when he slotted between the posts there were four points between the sides yet again, with  minutes gone. McCluskey’s pressure couldn’t prevent Jack Doherty from squeezing over the bar, however, Glen were going to need a goal. But it was Magherafelt that carved open the chance. Lynch’s kick-out was perfectly flighted. Jared Monaghan was involved, Darren O’Neill and Paddy McLarnon ferried the ball forward before Conor Kearns was cut down by Ciaran McFaul and a penalty was awarded. After a delay, Shane Heavron took the kick but Mullan-Young got down to save. The Glen ‘keeper reacted by pushing Heavron to pick up a booking but later intercepted when the Magherafelt wing back had a half-chance on goal. At the other end, Odhraacuten Lynch was flawless under the dropping ball. Tallon, Alex Doherty and Emmett Bradley floated points over in the closing stages as Magherafelt began to retreat. A replay was looking a distinct possibility with Glen’s waves of late attacks but they will carry the controversial conclusion into the winter months. What    But finals are all about the winners and Magherafelt’s greater control took John McLaughlin to join the reserve, U and U titles already at Rossa Park and an U final to look forward to on Wednesday.

MAN OF THE MATCH: Odhraacuten Lynch – Danny Tallon and Alex Doherty were the shining lights for Glen, with Emmett McGuckin among many Magherafelt contenders. However, in the pressure cooker environment, Odhraacuten Lynch’s kicking was fantastic throughout, he got his angles perfect to deny Ethan Doherty and was ice cool under the dropping ball. TURNING POINT: Lynch save – Glen had just edged into a - to - lead after  minutes when Ethan Doherty had his goal-bound shot saved by Odhraacuten Lynch. Emmett McGuckin replied with a peach of a score and in the  minutes that followed the Rossa press shut down Glen’s kick-outs, helping them to a four point interval lead. SCORE OF THE GAME: Emmett McGuckin – Within seconds of Lynch’s save, Rossa went on their trademark swt counter-attack and after a deft dummy, McGuckin fired over the bar to level the sides. It was the start of Magherafelt’s period of control and they never looked back.

Wins over Coleraine and their second-half grind against Banagher left them battle-hardened.  From the resultant kick-out Shane Heavron caught brilliantly but when he passed to his brother Danny over the top they looked like carving out an opening. The advantage wasn’t given by referee Cleary, play was called back and Shane fired over from the free. When the industrious John Young got inside Jack Doherty and was fouled, Heavron’s second free levelled the game.  In the th minute, Emmett McGuckin fed Shane Heavron but his low shot lacked conviction and Oisin Hegarty’s foot presented a goal, with Alex Doherty kicking over the first of his four points at the end of a counter-attack. When Paul Gunning hoovered up the break from the kick-out, Doherty booted over another score and Glen were - to - ahead. It was then that Magherafelt began to turn the screw in the game. They hemmed Glen into their own half. The Heavrons were off target and Antone McElhone hit the post but when goalkeeper Mullan-Young fluffed a kick-out, Glen were on the defensive and Cahir McCabe’s push on Shane Heavron handed the Rossa dead-ball specialist the chance to level matters after  minutes. An Emmett Bradley catch led to a Tallon point on the run and Glen were ahead. They could’ve opened a four point lead when Gunning and Emmett Bradley combined. Ethan Doherty was in on goal but the angle favoured Odhraacuten Lynch who stood up until the last minute to make the save. Seconds later, Emmett McGuckin swivelled his hips to buy space before kicking an equaliser. From the kick-out, McGuckin flicked to Danny Heavron, who passed to Antone McElhone for a point. With Glen ‘keeper Callum Mullan-Young struggling with his kick-outs, with a lack of movement outfield and midfield trio of McFaul, Dougan and Bradley unable to won the aerial battle, Glen’s grip on the cup began to slip. Heavron cut out a miscued kick-out to set-up John Young for a point. A further miskick saw Conor Kearns in on goal but Carville’s tackle saved Glen’s bacon. A second turnover of the half from Fergal Duffin began a breakaway, with Danny Heavron setting up his brother Shane for his only effort from play and Magherafelt were - to - ahead at the break. Glen needed an impetus and when Ciaran McFaul grabbed the throw-in, he gave Glen an early spark and Danny Tallon swung a long-range point. The story of the half was Magherafelt’s ability to hold Glen at arm’sand with Odhraacuten Lynch’s assured kicking, they had control of the game.  While Glen ran into Magherafelt’s perfectly laid trap and forced passes that weren’t on, their opponents were squeaky clean in possession. It was all about precision. Magherafelt’s decision to start Conor McCluskey on Jack Doherty was a masterstroke. He constantly forced Glen on the back foot. He added a point but once again Alex Doherty, this time with a crisp left footed effort, fired over to put three in it again. But Magherafelt’s game was a more polished version of their  version. Shane Heavron’s pass put Emmett McGuckin in and when he slotted between the posts there were four points between the sides yet again, with  minutes gone. McCluskey’s pressure couldn’t prevent Jack Doherty from squeezing over the bar, however, Glen were going to need a goal. But it was Magherafelt that carved open the chance. Lynch’s kick-out was perfectly flighted. Jared Monaghan was involved, Darren O’Neill and Paddy McLarnon ferried the ball forward before Conor Kearns was cut down by Ciaran McFaul and a penalty was awarded. After a delay, Shane Heavron took the kick but Mullan-Young got down to save. The Glen ‘keeper reacted by pushing Heavron to pick up a booking but later intercepted when the Magherafelt wing back had a half-chance on goal. At the other end, Odhraacuten Lynch was flawless under the dropping ball. Tallon, Alex Doherty and Emmett Bradley floated points over in the closing stages as Magherafelt began to retreat. A replay was looking a distinct possibility with Glen’s waves of late attacks but they will carry the controversial conclusion into the winter months. What    But finals are all about the winners and Magherafelt’s greater control took John McLaughlin to join the reserve, U and U titles already at Rossa Park and an U final to look forward to on Wednesday.

MAN OF THE MATCH: Odhraacuten Lynch – Danny Tallon and Alex Doherty were the shining lights for Glen, with Emmett McGuckin among many Magherafelt contenders. However, in the pressure cooker environment, Odhraacuten Lynch’s kicking was fantastic throughout, he got his angles perfect to deny Ethan Doherty and was ice cool under the dropping ball. TURNING POINT: Lynch save – Glen had just edged into a - to - lead after  minutes when Ethan Doherty had his goal-bound shot saved by Odhraacuten Lynch. Emmett McGuckin replied with a peach of a score and in the  minutes that followed the Rossa press shut down Glen’s kick-outs, helping them to a four point interval lead. SCORE OF THE GAME: Emmett McGuckin – Within seconds of Lynch’s save, Rossa went on their trademark swt counter-attack and after a deft dummy, McGuckin fired over the bar to level the sides. It was the start of Magherafelt’s period of control and they never looked back.

They issued some pointers on how to keep your animals safe: Microchipping The ISPCA strongly recommend that all dog owners have their pet’s microchipped in case they are taken or go missing over Halloween. This is a legal requirement for all dogs and puppies once they are  weeks old and failure to do so is an offence under the Animal Health  Welfare Act  . Dog owners need to be in possession of a microchipping certicate also so it is important your contact details are kept up-to-date. It is the pet owner’s responsibility to inform the database operator of any change of contact details so once your dog has been microchipped, check the database to ensure your details are correct. googletag.cmd.push If your pet becomes lost, having them microchipped is the best way to ensure they will be reunited with you as it’s the first thing a veterinary practice, rescue centre or dog warden do is to scan your pet for a microchip. Lost animals puts a lot of extra pressure on animal rescue centres, dog pounds and veterinary practices but it also causes more upset for pets and their owners so don’t delay and get your dog microchipped today – it’s the law!. While microchipping is recommended for all cat owners as well as dogs, there are no current plans to make microchipping compulsory for cats. Help your pets during Halloween Pet owners can help train their dogs and cats to become accustomed to the sounds of Halloween fireworks by playing similar sounds at low volumes. As dficult as it may be, try not to react to your pet showing signs of fear as it may be the best way you can help them. Licking objects such as toys filled with treats may help ease your pet’s stress. If they are up for it, playing with them may also be a welcome distraction, but don’t force ityour pet is too upset to play. Walk your dog in the morning and earlier evening away from any fireworks. If you are concerned that your pet is unmanageably terried of the noise of fireworks, you should consult your vet to discuss ways for managing your pet’s stress. Outdoor pets including small mammals or birds should also be brought indoors into a secure garage or shed where they can be secure from any loud noise or fireworks. You can also cover hutches or cages with blankets to act as sound-proofing. Horses, ponies and donkeys should also be microchipped, and those that live in areas with a considerable amount of Halloween-related noise should be securely stabled to prevent them from escaping or hurting themselves. Keep sweets and decorations out of reach Dogs and cats should be kept away from sweets and Halloween decorations. Chocolate and raisins are highly toxic to pets, as are any sweets containing the sugar substitute xylitol. Ingesting foil or plastic wrappers can also lead to digestive problems and may require surgery. If your pet does ingest something toxic, contact your vet immediately. Beware of costumes Not all pets will tolerate wearing costumes and it may cause them undue stress. Only dress up your pet for Halloweenyou know they enjoy it. Halloween themed bandanas can be less restrictive soyou do choose to put your pet in a costume, make sure it does not limit the animal’s movement, vision, ability to breathe or behave normally. Also ensure any costume doesn’t have any small, chewable pieces or toxic paints or dyes. People wearing Halloween costumes can be equally as scary to pets. Masks or other costume accessories may trigger their territorial instincts. While people might enjoy being spooked during the Halloween festivities, it’s not fun for pets. If your pet is scared, ensure they are in a separate room and safe place. Look out for wildle Hedgehogs go into hibernation this time of year and will sleep in woodpiles or heavy scrub and leaves. It is important you check under all woodpiles before lighting any bonfires to ensure there is no wildle hibernating. Some outdoor decorations such a fake spider webs or string lights can snare wild animals, so be careful about hanging them and remove them after the festivities. Report animal cruelty Unfortunately, stray animals can fall victim to abuse or cruel Halloween pranks. If you witness animal cruelty, contact your local Garda station immediately and the ISPCA National Animal Cruelty Helpline on  orreport online. ISPCA Public Relations Manager Carmel Murray said:“While we all enjoy the festivities of Halloween, many pets and wildle will find this time of year terrying. It is important that they have a secure place to hide indoorsthey are frightened by the noises of fireworks and trick-or-treaters calling to the door. Leaving the lights low, and playing the radio or television can help drown out some of the sounds as it can be a stressful time for them. It is also important our pets are kept safe in a secure room where they cannot dart out an open door. If your pet manages to escape, it is important they are wearing an ID tag plus they should be microchipped, which is a legal requirement for all dogs and puppies once they are  weeks old. Pets that have been found will be scanned for a microchip which holds the pet owners contact details so it is important this information is kept up to date. Carmel added: Halloween can also be a dangerous time for our wildle so it is important to check under wood, scrub and leaves for hibernating hedgehogs before lighting any bonfires. Sadly stray animals can fall victim to abuse or cruel Halloween pranks soyou witness any animal cruelty, contact your local Garda station immediately and report it to the ISPCA National Animal Cruelty Helpline on   .”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Gerard McElwee at McElwee Custom Motorcycles is one local business to have completed the Programme with Derry City and Strabane District Council after leaving full time employment to turn his lelong passion for motorcycles into a career.Celebrating the success of the Go For It Programme in the Council area, the Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, said: “The Go For It Programme continues to be a fantastic success in the area. “ I am delighted that so many entrepreneurs have established the business of their dreams with the incredible support and expert advice on offer at Enterprise North West and Strabane Enterprise Agency.“Council have steered  local entrepreneurs like Gerard from McElwee Custom Motorcycles through the business start-up process, helping them to turn their ideas into a reality. “Budding entrepreneurs can avail of expert advice to develop a comprehensive business plan, covering everything from accounts to marketing and long-term business growth.“New business start-ups, like McElwee Custom Motorcycles play a vital role in our local economy and as such, continue to be a priority for the Council. “I would encourage anyone who has a business idea to get in touch and utilise the expert advice that the Go For It Programme offers.”Strabane-based McElwee Custom Motorcycles is a specialist motorcycle workshop that focuses on custom builds and classic motorcycle restorations whilst also offering a full range of regular services including engine repairs, tyre fitting, maintenance and diagnostics. A specialist motorcycle mechanic by trade, Gerard McElwee has spent years mastering his trade, building his skillset with the goal of opening his own workshop in his home town. Gerard said: “Since I can remember I have always been fascinated with bikes, I got my first bike when I was  and started tinkering and learning from then. “Looking back it was clear that any future career would involve motorcycles, it is my true passion.“I worked in England, for Norton Motorcycles and it was there I developed my craft but I always knew I wanted to come home and open my own workshop. “I had the contacts within the local biking community, but lacked the business know- how to get the business off the ground. “The Go For it Programme was fantastic, they helped me turn my passion for restoring motorcycles into a robust and viable business. “Their guidance was really practical and they helped me to really reinforce my business idea into something which wasn’t available in the local area. “My business advisor at Strabane Enterprise Agency helped me to put together a business plan which outlined a clear growth strategy including financial forecasts, sales targets and marketing plans as well as insurance and legislative details. Since completing the Go For It Programme, Gerard has also availed of further support through the council’s Business Boost Programme, which aims to provide specialist support to small businesses within the Council area to grow their business. “Through Business Boost I was able to put my Go For It business plan into action to help strengthen and grow my business. “I held an evening for local motorcyclists in my workshop, showcasing what I could offer, making sure thatever they needed a repair, I would be the first to spring to mind. It proved really successful, and from then my workshop has been full.”“The Go For It Programme has opened many doors for me, including Derry City and Strabane District Councils pound, Business Start Up Challenge, where I was a runner up and was awarded pound,. “I was also named North West Business Person of the Year at the recent North West Business Awards. “These opportunities would have passed me byit hadn’t been for the Go For It Programme.”If you have a business idea you’d like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business contact the Go For It Programme on    or visit: www.goforitni. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sean Bell started the ball rolling for the Downpatrick side with a great opening point.

She insists that she intends to deliver the authentic voice of moderate, progressive Irish nationalism in a place where it needs to be heard.And she has vowed to be a hard working Peer, lobbying and building alliances with other peers and parties across the chamber that will bring benefit to people in Northern Ireland.And while the former MP regrets no longer being a member of the SDLP, she said her political views have not altered and will reflect the partyrsquos central social democratic messages focused on the needs of people and the principles of equality, fairness and social justice for all in the House of Lords.With her new title now confirmed, Baroness Ritchie described Downpatrick as a ldquohistoric place on the island of Ireland, where St Patrick began and ended his ministry.ldquoThe town is a place of immense heritage and has a longstanding history. It is uniquely associated on the island with the patron saint and is also associated with the Normans and the Vikings, she continued.ldquoDownpatrick is also place of inclusion and a shared society. The area was one of the first to share power at local government level and in the days of the old Urban Council, it had responsibility for allocating housing and did so very much on the basis of need.The Baroness said the Downpatrick area was very much at the vanguard of political inclusion in terms of ensuring that people belonged, explaining that she plans to use her new title to promote the town.Her House of Lords induction takes place on November  with her formal introduction taking place the following day when she will be introduced by her two sponsors on the floor of the chamber.Baroness Ritchiersquos sponsors will be former Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Lord Paul Murphy and Baroness Angela Smith, who is the shadow leader of the Lords.She is also former NIO minister who was responsible for the the health, economy and environment portfolios during her time at Stormont.Lord Murphy was also Minister of State and led the British Government in the talks process that led to the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie continued: ldquoI have picked my two sponsors on the basis that while I am going into the House of Lords as non-aligned and independent, my two sponsors understand the mechanics of the Good Friday Agreement and understand inclusion and power-sharing.ldquoMy maiden speech will hopefully take place sometime before the end of the year, although that could be subject to changea general election is called.Looking to the future, the Baroness said she has been using the past few weeks to get briefed on key issues which are important to her, including Brexit and its impact on the agri-food economy and local economy.ldquoTo me, there is no such thing as a good Brexit. The best deal for me is one where we will remain in the EU. What we have been presented with is one that is a bita curatersquos egg in many ways. There will ne no hard border which means no economic border and no veto in terms of the Assembly. Having said that, I am going to have to examine the Brexit deal in greater depth, she continued.ldquoThere are other issues that I want to focus on including the contaminated bloods issue, tourism VAT and what can be done to help our economy and ensure that we can grow and develop. The vaginal mess issue is something I have been associated with as is the importance of the Co Down fishing industry.Baroness Ritchie said while she does not have constituents, she will be speaking in a general Northern Ireland-wide context.ldquoI will be highlighting the importance of reflecting our political ersity and respect for political dference, ensuring that our institutions are up and running and that they respect the relationships between Ireland and Britain and Northern Ireland and the South.

The three of them were regularly checking the weather in the last few weeks leading up to race day as the temperatures were well up in the high s.Far too hot to be running a marathon, but thankfully in the final week it took a dramaticdown to nine degrees. Flying over on Friday with no time to waste, it was straight to the hotel and then immediately to the Expo to pick up their race numbers and buy some of the many race souvenirs that were on sale.In the Expo there was a wall of fame for all the runners who had completed the six majors. Murlough ACrsquos very own Paula McKibbin and Ann McAlarneyrsquos names were spotted on the wall for all to see.There was no time to get over the six-hours jet lag as they were all up at five in the morning and headed downtown to the start of the km friendship run.This was a bit of fun and involved a quick lap of the city centre finishing in Grant park. The rest of the day was spent in true MAC style with a boat cruise along the Chicago river before dinner in an Italian restaurant.The evening got better as needing a taxi for six people to take them back to the hotel, they managed to acquire the use of a party limousine at a very good rate.Another early start on Sunday as the marathon began at .am in the neighbouring Grant Park. Thankfully, it was only a  minute walk from the hotel. Theyrsquod only just made it into the corrals and the race started.A field of , runners, heading off north through the city, with defending champion Mo Farah expected to retain his title.As the route wound through the city it passed through many dferent districts, all with a party atmosphere and lined with people cheering and screaming encouragement.The noise during a major marathon in the USA is beyond belief, the bands playing, spectators lsquohigh fivingrsquo and the streets lined with people three or four thick is an experience like no other. We passed through the Mexican Quarter with bands playing and guys dancing, wearing sombreros and then on to Chinatownrsquo with the streets lined with drummers.It was then onto the Gay Quarter with drag queens performing on stage. It was a celebration for both runners and spectators.As with all marathons, the last five miles were a real test of mental determination as fatigue kicked in and Carol, unfortunately, was suffering from a knee injury that she picked up during training which ed at mile .They all pushed on with Hugh crossing the line first and recording a new personal best by one and a half minutes. Orla was next home followed by Charisse who recorded a huge personal best of  minutes.Carol was next home and managed to finish in a respectable time as she battled through the final  miles with knee problems. As the runners walked down the street after finishing they were greeted by four lines of local school kids applauding and congratulating all the runners. After the kids there were long tables either side of the street where one of the local sponsors, which happened to be a brewery, handing out free beer. Then onto the next table where they were given food and water.It makes you wonder what is not to like about this marathon  In the ladiesrsquo race a new world record was set as Brigid Kosgei beat Paula Radclfersquos record of  years. Ironically, as Carol finished her race and walked down to collect her medal she was presented with it from no other than Paula herself.It was back to the hotel to get ready for dinner that evening. As Hugh and Charisse walked back they talked about getting a pint of milk each for recovery.As the shop was a ten-minute walk away, Charisse said that even though she knew it would be a bit more expensive she was happy to buy milk for them both in the hotel bar.Being content with the two half pints that the bar served it was only when the bill was produced that they both discovered that they must have drunk the most expensive two glasses of milk ever, with a bill of  dollars. Anything to save tired feet.That evening they continued in MAC style, celebrating with a meal on Cindyrsquos roof top restaurant followed by a few beers in Buddy Guyrsquos Blues bar where we were treated in style with a table in the VIP area. The le of a Murlough AC member is indeed a good one and already planning has begun for the next Major.Meanwhile, the week before, Kieran McShane made the long trek to Australia to complete in the Melbourne Marathon.The race began with an early am start along Batman Avenue in the glorious sunshine. This was Kieranrsquos first big run in over three months due to injuries, so took him a lot longer to finish, but he says it just meant he had more time to take in the lovely views of Melbourne.It was an amazing race from start to finish taking in all the iconic places around Melbourne such as St Paulrsquos Cathedral, Flinders Street, Botanic Gardens and the Shrine of Remembrance.Followed by a lap around the GP circuit then up and down St Kildarsquos beach along the promenade.

Boris Johnson`s deal with the EU is an existential threat to the Union. It puts a border in the Irish Sea and places Northern Ireland on the window ledge of the Union.”He continued: “This election will be an opportunity to send Ulster Unionist MPs to Westminster who will not be patsies to a Tory government or ever agree to a border down the Irish Sea. Northern Ireland has been betrayed by Boris Johnson`s Conservative Government and we need to send a clear message to him and his advisers that we will not sit back and let him destroy the Union.”Mr Aiken added: “Anyone who casts a vote for Sinn Fein is wasting an opportunity to have their voice heard in Westminster. More than ever Northern Ireland needs MPs who will attend the House of Commons and exercise the democratic mandate. Northern Ireland needs MPs who are focused on improving the lives of their constituents and strengthening the Union rather than filling their boots, taking holidays in foreign countries and then lobbying on their behalf. That`s why I`ll be urging people to vote Ulster Unionist.”\"  \"  UK on course for pre-Christmas election Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Alliance leader Naomi Long sought to position her party as a voice for Remain.“This election will be mainly focused around Brexit and Alliance has always been clear there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit,” she said.“Therefore it will be an opportunity for people to have their say and elect MPs who want to avoid a hard border, protect the Good Friday Agreement and attend Westminster to represent their interests. We are uniquely placed to do that, as the Alliance surge seen in May’s local government and European Elections showed the party could reach across all sections of our community and gain support from everywhere.Mrs Long added: “We have been preparing for an election for some time, as it is clear this Parliament is hopelessly ided and the Government has no legitimacy. Northern Ireland voted to Remain. If people vote for Alliance candidates, we can increase the representation of progressive, pro-Remain MPs and articulate that voice loudly at Westminster.”The SDLP said the election was a defining moment.Their party leader, Colum Eastwood, said: “For three years, the democratic decision taken by people in Northern Ireland to reject a border on this island, to maintain the free and frictionless relationship we enjoy with Europe and to sustain our fragile peace has been wilfully ignored by successive Conservative governments and by the DUP. The coming election is an opportunity to reject the politics of ision and deadlock and defend our interests.”Mr Eastwood added: “This island’s destiny is being decided at Westminster. Like it or not, the only way to prevent the kind of outcome that would devastate our communities is to show up and vote it down. Our MPs have, with the exception of Sylvia Hermon, either facilitated this disaster or stood outside on the lawn shouting in. They have failed to defend our interests. It’s time to give the electorate a chance to cast their verdict on that failure.”Sinn Fein said the election could be used to show support for a referendum on Irish unity.Their party leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O’Neill, said: “This election is about our future.“It is a welcome opportunity for the people of the north to have their say on the looming disaster of Brexit. “It is a chance to reject the DUP and the Tories, to reject Brexit and the Westminster chaos and its destructive influence on the north of Ireland.”She continued: “There is no good Brexit for Ireland. “Westminster is in chaos. It has no answers and no solutions.“The Brexit debacle has shown that Westminster cannot, has not and will never act in the interests of the people of the north.”Mrs O’Neill added: “Your interests in this election are best served by voting Sinn Féin for a dferent future by sending a clear message to the British government that we want control of our own future through a referendum on Irish unity.”try catch  TrendingLATEST | Essex Police hunt N.I. brothers Ronan and Christopher Hughes wanted on suspicion of manslaughter of  men and women found dead in refrigerated trailerTeenager killed in NI road traffic collision -

His home has lost its parking space to the redevelopment. He said: ldquoItrsquos frustrating that we didnrsquot know the extent of developments until Saturday evening when the Vale tweeted plans.ldquoRoadworks have happened here before but theyrsquove not been as fundamentally le changing - the council didnrsquot say how big the impact on us would be during the survey or the consultation period.ldquoThey havenrsquot given any alternative parking provisions. We have had nine spaces taken away, which means  cars will be battling for spaces.ldquoWe understand the need to reduce cars and danger in the area but the way itrsquos been done will lead to reductions in house prices and make parking dficult for current residents. There are elderly people here, people with kids, how are they going to park all the way uphill  I had to go to casualty recently and this can make the dference between getting in the car outside and being in pain while my we gets the car several streets away.ldquoOut of the councilrsquos survey of  only  people replied, and  picked this option. I agree we need change, but going by the small number of people who actually wanted this it strikes me as something pushed through.ldquoFrom my perspective - and that of other residents here - the council could have been far more open and communicative during the process.Mike Clogg, Vale council operational manager for neighbourhood services and transport, said: ldquoThe council consulted widely on these proposals from May  to July  last year, a process that allowed residents to have their say by responding to the online survey, writing to the council or attending one of two drop-in sessions held at Belle Vue Pavilion.ldquoFour potential routes were proposed before this one was selected, a decision that was reached after  per cent of survey respondents identied this as their first or second choice.ldquoThe views of other interested parties were also considered, while there was also signicant media coverage on the matter.ldquoIt is dficult to please everyone when it comes to highway improvement schemes, but this project should be of major benefit to Penarth, improving traffic flow and reducing congestion.ldquoIt is part of a wider scheme of work involving building a new skate park at Penarth Leisure Centre and improvements to The Dingle Park.ldquoIt is hoped the scheme will encourage more people to walk to these locations and provide children with a safer route to the leisure centre and local schools.ldquoImprovements to the junction will also create a more attractive entrance to Penarth, while new plants, railings and public art will improve the appearance of The Dingle Park. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

We need a UK Labour Government that will stand up for the many.The Tories have been cutting budgets for nearly  years now.Since  they have scrapped over , frontline police officers.In the last year alone more than , children were pushed into absolute poverty.Boris Johnson has sought to ide our country.Labour would immediately raise the minimum wage to pound an hour for all ages, increase funding to Welsh Government for the NHS, and kickstart a green revolution.On Saturday it is expected that MPs willto Westminster to sit for a highly unusual session in Parliament, as we reach the critical stage of the Brexit process.Weekend sittings are very rare, and the House has only sat on four Saturdays since  ndash on September ,  at the outbreak of World War II on July , as a final summer sitting on November ,  to debate the Suez Crises and on April ,  over the Falkland Islands invasion.A Saturday sitting, two days after the EU summit, is likely to be a decisive moment in determining the future of our country.Saturday will also see a lsquoTogether for the Final Sayrsquo march to Parliament Square.When a similar march took place earlier this year an estimated million people of all ages, from every corner of the UK and from all walks of le, took part ndash including many from Penarth and Cardf who travelled to London to make their voices heard.Their message was absolutely clear then ndash and mine remains the same now - that the people must be given a final say on this Brexit disaster. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey. APCOA sees this investment as strengthening their position in Northern Ireland and providing a  for increased growth.Combining the existing APCOA expertise and customer base across both countries, this acquisition now makes APCOA a leading mobile parking operator in cashless parking providing convenient, cashless and cost-effective payment options to nearly , parking customers.Both APCOA and NCPS see this as a real opportunity to broaden the strength of services to clients and to improve capabilities by bringing together the best knowledge, systems and operational practice. Kim Challis, regional managing director for APCOA UK  Ireland, said: “The businesses complement each other well across dferent geographies and business sectors and both have strong management and operational teams.  “There are opportunities to share innovation and technology solutions from both companies across the whole business, and also to benefit from the on-going investment and business experience that comes from APCOA UK  Ireland being part of a larger European group. We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year. With every acquisition, we have pursued a clear strategy: not to become a property owner. Thanks to its consistent ‘asset light’ business model, APCOA has established itself as a reliable partner, maximising the value of both private and public property owners’ assets. “At the same time, APCOA offers consumers a range of products and services that are increasingly digital and that span the entire market.” These acquisitions have enabled APCOA to expand its presence in each market and position itself for further profitable growth.
