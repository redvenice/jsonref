Supermodel Kate Moss, a friend of Sir Philip Green, was pictured cracking a smile out in London today but has yet to say anything about the bullying accusations against the businessman\u0027The problem is there is no way to force him to do it as it\u0027s a private company. So Simon\u0027s stuck with him.\u0027 Celebrity friends of Sir Philip Green are still keeping quiet over the allegations against the billionaire a day after it was revealed he had tried to use gagging orders to silence accusations against him.Supermodel Kate Moss, who has twice worked with Sir Philip on Topshop lines, and singer Rita Ora have both been in public today while maintaining their silence.But other associates of the tycoon are beginning to distance themselves from him.Beyonce, once hired to perform at one of his private parties, and actress-turned lifestyle guru Gwyneth Paltrow both told MailOnline they had no comment on the accusations today.And friends of Simon Cowell said the X Factor boss had not spoken to Sir Philip in more than three years, with the billionaire previously advising the music mogul on business deals. Moss was today pictured at Heathrow cracking a smile but said nothing about the furore around her friend Sir Philip. Meanwhile Ora was pictured at Milan Airport having also stayed quiet on the row.   The supermodel was seen enjoying a coffee this morning as she was pictured with a trolley full of luggage  Singer Rita Ora is another friend of Sir Philip\u0027s who has not commented on the row.

Her other companion is Anglo-Asian police officer Yasmin Khan (Mandip Gill).In last Sunday’s episode, the Doctor and her companions travelled back in time to the moment black bus passenger Rosa Parks ignited the US civil rights movement.          For some viewers, Jodie Whittaker’s debut series as the Time Lord has become a tiresome ordeal of political correctnessOne fan wrote: ‘There should be a clever story line, not a rehash of history. There’s also an underlying feeling the focus has been forcing inclusiveness by having such obviously erse characters.’Another said: ‘Please keep the PC stuff for documentaries and serious drama and let the Doctor help us escape to a fantasy world.’Similar criticism is likely to follow an upcoming episode called Demons Of The Punjab, set during the Partition of India in 1947.But Frazer Hines, who played the Doctor’s companion Jamie McCrimmon between 1966 and 1969, said: ‘I was a bit worried about the Rosa Parks episode because race is obviously a sensitive issue, but I thought it was very well done.’  First, we had the Rosa Parks race relations plot... Last week’s storyline – in which the Doctor and her companions come to the rescue of heroic civil rights campaigner Rosa Parks in Alabama in 1955 – may have been ideal for Black History Month but its heavy-handed message led one fan to dub it the ‘racism-is-bad episode’.           The Doctor and her companions come to the rescue of heroic civil rights campaigner Rosa Parks in Alabama in 1955Next, we\u0027ll be told we did bad things in IndiaThe political education in the Rosa Parks episode will continue in the upcoming Demons Of The Punjab – set during the Partition of India in 1947 and guest-starring Shane Zaza (Happy Valley). It’s likely to show the evil consequences of the British Empire and colonialism, as the Doctor’s companion Yasmin goes back in time to search for her grandmother.            The political education in the Rosa Parks episode will continue in the upcoming Demons Of The Punjab, set in India in 1947The Doctor is too busy preaching to fight any aliens...In the opening episode, the Doctor pleads with psychotic alien Tzim-Sha – his face encrusted with the teeth of his victims – to look deep inside himself and leave his murderous ways behind. Unsurprisingly, the preachy approach doesn’t work and the Time Lord is forced to resort to more drastic action.

Mr Hammond is better able to meet his spending pledges because of a tax windfall. A mental health specialist for every school, a Universal...British high streets \u0027have to change\u0027 insists Chancellor...Share this articleThe public finances in the current financial year 2018-19 are in much better shape than forecast by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility in the spring.Strong tax receipts, the result of near full employment and consumer confidence, mean that the Chancellor has an extra £13billion of cash to play with.Remarkably, a decade of squeezing public spending and better-than-expected growth has seen the budget deficit plunge from £150billion to just £25billion. The national debt, the accumulation of borrowing down the decades, has also begun falling.The Chancellor is, additionally, starting to factor in a double Brexit idend should Mrs May secure a deal with Brussels that could release up to £15billion of extra tax income as the economy takes off once we are free of EU red tape and restrictions. It is hoped, too, that companies holding off on investment decisions will, post-deal, bring them forward, contributing to faster output.And any deal could also release the £10billion or so that the Chancellor has been keeping in his back pocket to cushion a ‘no deal’ exit from the EU (although the Treasury is clear that this money will not be available until the spending review next spring).          Strong tax receipts, the result of near full employment and consumer confidence, mean that the Chancellor has an extra £13billion of cash to play with However, Mr Hammond will need more than these windfalls to deliver on Prime Minister Theresa May’s announcement that austerity is over. And he’s not going to miss an opportunity to strengthen the public finances with new taxes.One possibility is that he will choose to freeze the personal allowances for income tax, pushing a larger number of people into higher tax bands.  In essence, it’s a sleight of hand, a hidden income tax increase, but it does break an election manifesto pledge not to raise income tax. Other targets include the tax relief granted for pensions savings, which Mr Hammond has described as ‘eye-wateringly’ generous. They particularly benefit more affluent households, and successive Chancellors have had them in their sights.          In essence, it’s a sleight of hand, a hidden income tax increase, but it does break an election manifesto pledge not to raise income taxA near certain target is contract workers in the private sector. They currently escape national insurance and income tax requirements by working as independent contractors. The measure, already applied to the public sector, could eventually raise up to £1billion for the Exchequer.A range of ‘sin taxes’ on offshore gambling, tobacco and alcohol are also expected.More controversial would be a rise in insurance premium tax, paid on car and home policies, and lowering the threshold at which firms start to pay VAT from the current figure of £85,000 – far higher than most of the EU.Of course, the most crowd-pleasing tax the Chancellor could impose would be on digital behemoths such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook, which earn billions of pounds in Britain but pay virtually no corporation or company taxes of any size.Mr Hammond wants to bring them within the tax net, possibly through a ‘user levy’, which would impose a charge for each click. But such a sophisticated levy will take some years to implement. As an interim measure the Treasury favours a tax on turnover or sales (as opposed to profits).Certainly, the Chancellor is going into the budget in a much stronger position than he could have hoped for just six months ago, courtesy of an economy that has expanded speedily enough to defy Project Fear and other gloomy forecasts about the impact of the EU referendum.However, as a Tory Chancellor he must not sacrifice the hard-won fiscal gains of a decade of austerity.Britain still has a legacy of £1.5trillion of national debt, which, at 86 per cent of national output, remains historically high. Yes, the debt is beginning to fall, but not fast enough for the Chancellor to release the handbrake without public finances going into reverse.

This week, just a few miles away, his former friends Brian May (left) and Roger Taylor (right) strolled up the purple carpet at the premiere of the film Bohemian Rhapsody (Rami Malek, centre, who plays the role of Freddie Mercury)Drummer Taylor describes him as a \u0027sociopath\u0027, while May suggests that Deacon has never recovered since a booze and drug-soaked period which he implies led to a breakdown more than 35 years ago.Extraordinarily, Taylor says they haven\u0027t spoken in more than a decade. \u0027I haven\u0027t heard a squeak from John, not a single guttural grunt,\u0027 he adds. \u0027We\u0027re not in touch but John\u0027s a sociopath, really, and he\u0027s given his blessing to whatever Brian and I might do with the brand — and we\u0027ve done rather a lot.\u0027May says he contacts Deacon often to ask permission for various commercial enterprises to do with Queen (Deacon remains a quarter shareholder in Queen Productions Limited) but it\u0027s not clear how much of a response he gets.The company is blue-chip to say the least — turnover was recorded at £18.5 million in 2017, with that figure set to swell thanks to the new film.Not that you would suspect such riches from his unassuming home in Putney, which he bought with his first royalty cheque.He\u0027s never moved, because he didn\u0027t want to disrupt the schooling of his six children. This quiet living is the exact opposite of the showy excesses of Queen.          John Deacon, left, Freddie Mercury, centre, and Brian May, right, pictured in 1979The band were famous for always demanding the best, for spending more than anyone else on private jets, stretch limos, fleets of assistants, hairdressers, designer stage costumes and the rest.There were four-course backstage feasts with candelabras, orgiastic parties involving dwarves and bowls of cocaine and appearances by performance artists, like the man who lay naked under a pile of chopped liver and was ordered to make the meat twitch when people walked past.The band was formed in 1970, originating from a band called Smile which included May, then a student at Imperial College.A fan of the band was Farrokh Bulsara, a student at Ealing College, who joined as the vocalist and changed his name to Freddie Mercury.They had a number of bass players before settling on Deacon. Legend has it that he was the seventh one they auditioned.          Queen were, of course, shattered by Freddie Mercury\u0027s death in 1991, but since then, May (right) and Roger Taylor (centre left) have continued to record, tour and perform, both as solo artists and as Queen\u0027We were so over-the-top, we thought that because he was quiet, he would fit in with us without too much upheaval,\u0027 recalled Taylor. May agreed: \u0027He\u0027s very solid and no-nonsense. He\u0027s always got his feet firmly on the ground.\u0027Deacon grew up in Leicestershire, the eldest child of an insurance broker, Arthur, who died when John was 11.He had been encouraged by his father to take up music, and formed his own band at 14. Deacon was, like May, a technological pioneer.He has a first-class degree in electronics from Chelsea College, and used to build equipment for the band, his most famous creation being the \u0027Deacy Amp\u0027 amplifier.Worldwide fame came in the mid 70s, with Bohemian Rhapsody. Their touring was legendary and their studio albums were complex and expensive to make.Deacon was known to hang back on stage, and those who remember him from this time say he seemed cripplingly shy — although with a dry sense of humour.\u0027John is one of those guys who will say nothing and then he will crack a joke, something really near the knuckle, and you will think: \u0027Did I really hear that right?\u0027 says Jacky Smith, who runs the Queen International fan club. He and Freddie were particularly friendly and would hang out together between gigs.Manager Chris O\u0027Donnell says: \u0027Brian May and Roger Taylor, who were the real rockers in the band, would slip away to hang out at some club in town leaving Freddie and John behind. John gradually started leaving too, and Freddie would go off to prowl the gay clubs.\u0027           Deacon was known to hang back on stage, and those who remember him from this time say he seemed cripplingly shy — although with a dry sense of humour. Left to right: John Deacon, Freddie Mercury, Roger Taylor and Brian MayPhil Sutcliffe, author of Queen: The Ultimate Illustrated History of the Crown Kings of Rock, said: \u0027John Deacon was very much the silent bass player which is why these days he can go around practically incognito, which is just the way he likes it.\u0027He was always ambivalent about the attention.\u0027Queen was a very volatile partnership between three explosive personalities, and then you had John, who was the still point. He had his family early on, from 1975, and was very much a family man.\u0027Deacon married Veronica Tetzlaff, a pretty blonde Polish Catholic trainee teacher, in January 1975 when she was pregnant with their first son, Robert, and Queen were just tasting global fame. They went on to have four more sons and a daughter. May said in an interview last year that the band  out of control while recording in Munich in the early 1980s. In a book he said that the band were: \u0027Living in a fantasy world of vodka and barmaids.\u0027He added: \u0027We all lost our minds . . . we were all in a perilous place where our emotions were out of control.\u0027It manifested itself in way too much drinking, a certain amount of drugs, which I didn\u0027t share — but certainly an awful lot of vodka went through my body. We all fell to bits.          Their touring was legendary and their studio albums were complex and expensive to make\u0027We overreacted with each other at times. We all left the band at some point. The studio\u0027s a hard place for a band anyway, but in our case all four of us as writers had had worldwide hits. The lifestyle we led magnified that conflict.\u0027May said it ended with \u0027John disappearing to Bali and seeing God or whatever\u0027. He added: \u0027He could be very outgoing and very funny, but I think some of the stuff that happened in Munich gave him a lot of damage, and I think losing Freddie was very hard for him as well. He found that incredibly hard to process, to the point where actually playing with us made it more difficult.\u0027In a rare interview, Deacon said he found the band\u0027s hiatus in 1985 hard to cope with. \u0027I went spare, really, because we were doing so little. I got really bored and quite depressed.\u0027Queen reformed the following year and continued to dominate the charts, playing sell-out stadium tours for the next two years.In July 1986 they threw a famous party at the Roof Gardens in Kensington to celebrate a gig at Wembley. The serving staff were entirely naked apart from body paint.Mercury, tortured by his promiscuous homosexuality, arrived with former girlfriend Mary Austin — his lover Jim Hutton nowhere to be seen. Deacon was overcome by booze. Fan club boss Jacky, who was on the same table, says: \u0027At one point late into the night John just slipped quietly off his chair, and ended up underneath the table. After a while he came back again. That was very John, he liked a drink.\u0027But Mercury\u0027s failing health began to cast a shadow. In 1987, not long after that party, Mercury was diagnosed HIV positive. As his health failed, the band made one final album. Mercury died in November 1991, and the band members were devastated — none more so than Deacon.Robert Ahwai, a friend of Deacon\u0027s from college, recalls: \u0027Maybe he thought, \u0027Freddie was the band, so what\u0027s the point?\u0027          Mercury died in November 1991, and the band members were devastated — none more so than Deacon\u0027He suffered from depression after Freddie died and I am not sure he has ever come out of it.\u0027Deacon played with May and Taylor at the Freddie Mercury Tribute concert in April 1992 and again, in January 1997, to showcase the final Queen song No-one But You (Only The Good Die Young) — a tribute to Mercury. Since then, he\u0027s barely been seen in public.When the musical We Will Rock You opened, May admitted that Deacon had not been to see it — although I\u0027m told he has been spotted in the audience.Queen author Sutcliffe says: \u0027After Freddie died, John withdrew more and more. I think Brian May once said that they tell John everything they are doing, and take his silence as acquiescence. He is an enigma.\u0027Jacky Smith agrees. \u0027John just gave up after Freddie died. He and Freddie were opposites really, because John is so shy and he was the youngest in the band. Freddie took him under his wing and they were very close for all those years.\u0027Freddie drew the attention away, and without Freddie there, I don\u0027t think John could face any of it.\u0027There was a short-lived scandal when it emerged in 2002 that Deacon had been visiting a strip bar and formed a friendship with lap dancer Emma Shelley, with whom he was photographed in central London.Those who know John say the episode seems out of character, and are dubious about how far these proclivities went.One neighbour said this week: \u0027You are wasting your time if you are trying to find John. He does live there, but he doesn\u0027t talk, not to anyone.\u0027I haven\u0027t seen him in a long time, he is fine, just private. The last time I saw him was a few months ago, in the summer.\u0027In an interview with a fansite some years ago, Deacon said his hobbies were drinking tea and having children.These days John Deacon\u0027s great passion is said to be golf — hardly the soul of rock \u0027n\u0027 roll. A desire for anonymity seems to be a recurring theme.The barman who used to serve him at his local pub revealed that he\u0027d been warned by Deacon\u0027s wife Veronica who the musician was — and was told not to mention Queen.So what next? Maybe John Deacon will go to see the new film, in which he is played by American actor Joseph Mazzello.But if he does, you can bet he will do his best to slip into the local cinema as just another anonymous face in the crowd."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/27/06/51AD9A7100000578-6322735-A_glowing_Meghan_Markle_watched_the_Invictus_Games_wheelchair_ba-a-42_1540617030633.jpg","title":"Harry pregnant Meghan attend Invictus Games basketball match","story":"    All smiles: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle addressed the packed closing ceremony of the Invictus Games on Saturday night    Jubilant: The pair are pictured at the Invictus Games on Saturday night in their last engagement in Australia before heading to New Zealand on Sunday morning          Meghan addressed the buzzing crowd in the Qudos Bank Arena which can hold 21,000. Meghan said: \u0027During this year\u0027s games in Sydney, I\u0027ve witnessed the most amazing support networks that surround competitors.\u0027  In a short speech to the 12,0000-strong crowd in the Qudos Bank Arena, Meghan thanked organisers and athletes for making the Games so special          The Duchess said: \u0027It is such an honour to be here tonight, celebrating all of you and supporting my husband in the Invictus Games which he founded four years ago.\u0027    Prince Harry took the stage to rapturous applause.

The choir sang at the Invictus closing ceremony          As always when these Games close, I would like to start by saying thank you.To PK and Lieutenant General Peter Lay and the whole Sydney 2018 team - the vision and hard work has paid off and you have put on a truly magnificent Invictus Games.Thank you for being our partners over the last couple of years, and our team at the Invictus Games Foundation, especially Dominic Reid and Rose Hall, for their tireless efforts and hard work.To the people of Australia who filled the stands and cheered on the sidelines - thank you so much. Your energy powered our competitors all week and you made these Games your own by creating a typically Aussie atmosphere.To the friends and families who got our competitors to the start line and applauded them all the way to the finish line, thank you. You are all part of one big Invictus family and none of us would be here without you.And to the competitors goes the biggest thanks of all. You have once again left us humbled and inspired by your example, by your determination, by your service and by your sense of humour.Last Saturday, I spoke about how you were part of the Invictus generation. Your choice to serve your nations places you alongside those storied generations that have come before you, that fought two world wars and then secured a world order built on freedom, democracy, and tolerance.And of course this choice to serve - this choice to put yourselves at risk for the benefit of others - is at the very heart of what I founded these Invictus Games to celebrate. I wanted your service to be recognised.But what we saw again this week is that Invictus is so much more. Your example goes beyond the military community. It is about more than just your inspiring stories of recovery from injury and illness.It is about your example of determination, of optimism, of strength, honour and friendship, or as the Aussies call it \u0027mateship\u0027, as a core value that has the power to inspire the world.When we saw Paul Guest and Edwin Vermetten support each other through Paul\u0027s struggle with Post Traumatic Stress on the tennis court in front of a large audience, we saw what mateship really looks like.When Jakub Tynka fought through excruciating leg pain for the final 20 minutes of his cycling event, and let the cheering crowd and his fellow competitors Benjamin and Cedric push him over the finish line, we saw the definition of strength.When you saw Hannah Stolberg crossing the finish line on a bike which belonged to a late fellow serviceman whose values she strives to emulate, you witnessed the real meaning of honour.

She is pictured putting on  parachute with the US Army in Italy          Meghan Markle shakes hands with a group of sailors and gets a tour of the USS Ross in Spain when she visited bases while working on Suits  Ryan Patrick Novack of the United States competes in the Mens 400m in Sydney. Meghan referenced his courage in her speechIn travelling to these military bases, I was given a very special glimpse into the lives of those who serve our countries. I was able to see the unshakeable bond between servicemen and women on the ground together, but at the same time to feel the palpable longing for family and friends while deployed. Once home, the need for that anchor of support from loved ones, especially given how much it accelerates recovery and rehailitation is immeasurable. I\u0027ve been reminded of those memories here.During this year\u0027s Games in Sydney, I have witnessed the most amazing support networks that surround competitors, and I\u0027ve had the privilege of meeting several of these family and friends. The Novack family from Chicago is a prime example of this very thing. When their son, Ryan, suffered a severe injury leaving him paralysed from the waist down, doctors said he would never be able to walk again, but after speaking to his mum, Kerry, it was clear that it was through Ryan\u0027s strength of spirit and with the unwaivering support of his parents that he was able to prove all of those doctors wrong.Not only has Ryan competed in sailing, swimming and athletics this week, but when Harry and I saw him at the finish line of the sailing competition, he literally jumped into our boat, with dexterity and ease by the way, to give both of us a hug.Seeing Ryan\u0027s mum on the water that day, waving a flag to cheer him on was a moment I will never forget. The support system on the ground here in Invictus is something unlike any other because it\u0027s not just cheering on your own, but realising that by the end of this week, your own becomes everyone in the Invictus Family.It was, after all, only within 24 hours of meeting other families at the Games that another competitor\u0027s little girl was calling Kerry Aunty Kerry. This is what the Invictus Family is all about.On that note, I would like to invite everyone to please join me in a huge round of applause to thank all of the friends and family who have helped make these Games possible. Meghan turned heads in tuxedo-inspired Antonio Berardi halterneck in a green hue with a buttoned wrap detail around the waist that perfectly skimmed her growing baby bump.She accessorised with a crescent-shaped clutch bag and added a dazzling touch to the ensemble with statement earrings beneath her delicate chignon while Harry looked dapper in a light grey suit and white shirt.The couple earlier returned to Sydney just in time to watch the final day of the Games before heading to New Zealand for the last leg of their Commonwealth tour. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex  arrived at the wheelchair basketball final just after the match started at 2.10pm, receiving a standing ovation from the crowd. After the final whistle, pregnant Meghan went on court to give the Netherlands and USA players their medals and one cheeky Dutch player kissed her on the cheek.The bold move was technically a breach of protocol because the correct way for men to greet a member of the royal family is with a neck bow (from the head only) - but informal Meghan touched the player on the shoulder and smiled as he kissed her. The Duchess was glowing in a $550 maroon crepe knit wrap top by Australian designer Scanlan Theodore. She wore a Remembrance Day poppy on her left side and paired the top with black tapered trousers and high heels.           A cheeky Dutch player gave Meghan a kiss on the cheek after the final whistle. According to Royal.uk the correct way for men to greet a member of the royal family is with \u0027a neck bow (from the head only).

He\u0027d put his hand up the back of her skirt – apparently getting a kick from both her boyfriend\u0027s ignorance and her powerlessness to stop him.\u0027Why did no one challenge him sooner,\u0027 the buyer asked me. \u0027Who\u0027s to say a hand cupping a buttock is worse than being shouted at while you\u0027re on the phone to a supplier in the Far East – yelling that you must make them drop their prices.\u0027It got to the point I felt sick every Sunday night at the prospect of going to work.

I met him in his boardroom at Arcadia HQ on Berners Street with its view of the London Eye before his chauffeur and bodyguard, Kevin, drove us to the Royal Academy, where his brands – Topshop, Evans, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins, Burton – were showing their wares to the press. In the limo, he chain-smoked Philip Morris – \u0027I have to have one pleasure in life\u0027 – and slagged off every designer store we passed. \u0027Stella McCartney? Never made two bob.\u0027 When I asked about his employees, his reputation as a rottweiler, he told me: \u0027I give a straight yes or no. They are empowered.\u0027He introduced me to his wife, Tina (who owns 92 per cent of Arcadia shares) and 14-year-old daughter, Chloe. When I later wrote that Chloe was wearing mukluk boots, which are made of fur, something banned in his stores, he complained to my editor, a soignee woman who that morning had no need of a blow dry.But he could be loyal.

He called me, swearing, and told me I was \u0027anti-Semitic\u0027. \u0027No,\u0027 I said. \u0027These girls don\u0027t have much money. You were grooming them.\u0027 As, over the years, I refused to fawn over him, his mood swung between extremes. After I wrote a rave review of one collection, he sent me a gorgeous olive greatcoat, still warm from the model who\u0027d worn it. Later, after a bad review, his right-hand woman called me. \u0027He wants his coat back.\u0027The last time I spoke to Green was at an Evans show in the autumn of 2014. He\u0027d sat me front row of this plus-size show (now that\u0027s a laugh in Oliver Shah\u0027s biography, he is reported to have told a female buyer: \u0027You\u0027re absolutely f****** useless. I should throw you out the window but you\u0027re so fat you\u0027d probably bounce back in again\u0027), as I\u0027d been at the vanguard of a campaign to give big women the fashion they deserve. Afterwards he asked if we could pose together for the paparazzi. I said no. Unlike every female glossy editor in the land, I felt to do so would betray my readers. I couldn\u0027t bring myself to stand next to him, gurning.          I can\u0027t help but remember the image, at his show inside the old Eurostar terminal in Waterloo, of American Vogue editor Anna Wintour, looking like the cat who got the zero fat cream because Green had arranged for her own personal escalator on which to glide in, and glide out (when approached for this story, her silence was deafening). Above, at Tate Britain in 2016Everyone in fashion knew he was a tyrant, but it\u0027s unreasonable to expect teenage models and junior employees to stand up to him you might wonder why anyone would sign a gagging order, but this was a seriously powerful man.So it was the responsibility of the senior company executives, editors, publishing directors and model agents to be on the side of the women who toil in low-paid jobs in stores and factories and lap up glossy fashion magazines.I can\u0027t help but remember the image, at his show inside the old Eurostar terminal in Waterloo, of American Vogue editor Anna Wintour, looking like the cat who got the zero fat cream because Green had arranged for her own personal escalator on which to glide in, and glide out (when approached for this story, her silence was deafening).I can\u0027t help but think back to the meetings of magazine editors and London Fashion Week bigwigs in the boardroom of Vogue House, where not one woman had the courage to say, \u0027What can we do about Philip Green?\u0027Or, later, as the BHS scandal erupted and the pension hole gaped, why even then did not one of them take him to task over the number of employees his greed was condemning to penury?My guess? They were too busy counting his advertising spend, and nursing their 40 per cent Topshop discount card.Even today, when I ask Caroline Rush CBE, chief executive of the British Fashion Council, who will have had more dealings with Green than most, if she ever took him to task, I\u0027m told her PA is away on honeymoon. I email the British Fashion Council press office and ask them to call her on her mobile. How bad is this for British fashion? Will he show next season? She doesn\u0027t ring back. It is her job to reply. This is what she is paid to do.Or Baroness Karren Brady CBE (don\u0027t you love all these titles?), who has been vocal about fighting sexism in business, and has been chair of Arcadia\u0027s parent company, Taveta, for eight years.I ask if she knew of allegations that Green gave female staff \u0027lingering hugs\u0027 and asked if they wanted their \u0027bottoms slapped\u0027 or, indeed, had paid substantial sums to settle complaints. Only her PA gets back to me: \u0027Karren is away until next week.\u0027 But this is important! She\u0027s got a phone, hasn\u0027t she? I visit her glorious villa next to Harrods no one answers the door.How about Naomi Campbell, who publicly attacked former Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman – now a Mail on Sunday columnist – for having too many white staff? Did Naomi ever find Green racist? No reply.How about Kate Moss? Would she like to offer her support to him, given he\u0027d been so loyal to her in the past? She was \u0027about to get on a plane\u0027, apparently.Or Edward Enninful OBE, new super-erse editor of UK Vogue? No reply.Come on, then, Natalie Massenet, Net-a-Porter founder and one-time chair of the British Fashion Council? She can\u0027t be scared of anyone. She\u0027s a bleeding Dame! I get an email. \u0027Natalie is going to reach out to you.\u0027 I\u0027m still waiting.Isn\u0027t it telling that the only powerful person in British fashion I can find who is willing to speak out about Green is a man – although he doesn\u0027t want me to use his name.No longer employed by Topshop, he tells me: \u0027He\u0027s outrageous. This is all typical of him. Doing it in the first place is unacceptable, covering it up is ridiculous.\u0027Is he a sexual predator, a racist? \u0027The real issue is this: he will never be aware that he has done anything wrong. He just doesn\u0027t get it, he will never change.\u0027Is that why he left Green\u0027s company? \u0027I left because I didn\u0027t like the way he treated people. My mum told me that we are all equal, and that we should treat everyone with respect. He didn\u0027t treat anyone with respect.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/28/15/51BA29F500000578-0-image-a-22_1540742349720.jpg","title":"Newlyweds miss 4 000 dream honeymoon dog chewed grooms passport","story":"    Daniel and Mia Farthing, pictured with their labrador collie cross Milo and the passport he nibbled on as a puppyMrs Farthing, 25, told The Mirror: \u0027He knows he\u0027s done wrong because he\u0027s been constantly coming to us for cuddles.\u0027She said that when her partner\u0027s new passport arrived four years ago the dog \u0027got to it first and chewed it\u0027.  Her husband, 26, said that UK Border Force staff told him the document would not be an issue to travel to Indonesia as long as the details were still there. On their way back to Britain the couple stopped in Singapore where Mr Farthing says he was detained for seven hours, and his wife ran up a £216 phone bill calling relatives in a panic.Mrs Farthing, a hospital receptionist from Suffolk, said once the pair had landed back in Heathrow an air hostess looked at the passport and asked: \u0027Is this what all the fuss was about?\u0027           Once they landed in Indonesia after a 16-hour flight, airport officials decided that Mr Farthing\u0027s passport was not acceptable and the couple had to take the first flight back to the UK (file photo of Candidasa Beach, Bali)Cash-rich millennials are splurging on \u0027Pawsecco\u0027, birthday...Coldest October days for a decade as Arctic blast brings...Share this articleNewlyweds refused entry to Bali for honeymoon after 16-hour flight because dog chewed corner of passport - Mirror Online"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/27/00/519D352500000578-0-image-m-3_1540595794128.jpg","title":"Kiwi uses word groutier help seal World Scrabble Championships","story":"    Nigel Richards (pictured), 51, from New Zealand, won his fourth World Scrabble Championship title    Mr Richards played the word \u0027groutier\u0027 to win this years title which means grouty and is defined as sullen, bad-tempered or sulky, scored 68 pointsIt allowed Mr Richards to soar into the lead and win by 575 points, 123 more than Californian opponent Jesse Day.After his win at the championships, held at at Westfield, White City, London, Mr Richards said: \u0027I am absolutely thrilled to have won two world championships this year, including French and English.Young couple who found six diamond rings worth $18,000...Yowza!

Boycott (pictured), a wealthy retired Army officer turned farmer in IrelandDuring the Irish Land War in 1880, tenants who were charged unfair rents were encouraged to stop dealing with the land agents representing their affluent landlords.One early non-violent protest was against Charles C. Boycott, a wealthy retired Army officer turned farmer in County Mayo. When his tenants, who as part of their rental agreement farmed his land for him, asked him to reduce rents by 25 per cent, Boycott refused and attempted to evict them.In response, they refused to talk to anyone associated with him and withdrew their labour.Their efforts were ultimately futile. After the incident was reported in the newspapers, a \u0027Boycott Relief Fund\u0027 was established and volunteers from Belfast arrived to harvest the crop.          The word \u0027dunce\u0027 is derived from a 13th-century monk, John Duns Scotus (pictured)Dunce — someone who is slow at learningThe word \u0027dunce\u0027 is derived from a 13th-century monk, John Duns Scotus.Scotus — who hailed from the village of Duns in Scotland — was a theologian of great repute. Indeed his scholarship remains highly esteemed in the Catholic Church and he was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1993 — the first step to becoming a saint.During the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, Catholic teachings were widely criticised, and adherents of Scotus\u0027s beliefs were characterised as too stupid to think for themselves. Anyone espousing his theories became known as \u0027Duns\u0027 and considered intellectually inferior.Foxtrot — a ballroom danceThe foxtrot is said to have been invented by vaudeville entertainer Harry Fox in 1914 when he began performing a fast yet simple trotting-style dance during his performances at the New York Theatre.The dance was immediately popular in clubs, and by the end of 1914 the American Society Of Professors Of Dancing decided to teach it as the Foxtrot.          The foxtrot is said to have been invented by vaudeville entertainer Harry Fox (pictured) in 1914 when he began performing a fast yet simple trotting-style dance during his performances at the New York TheatreGuillotine — execution machine consisting of a sharp blade which drops between a wooden frame to swiftly sever the headIn 1779, Dr Joseph Ignace Guillotin, a senior Parisian politician opposed to capital punishment, suggested to the French National Assembly that an execution machine which was fast and efficient would be more humane.A prototype was designed and the first victim (a highwayman) was beheaded in 1792.During the French Revolution between 1789-99, Guillotin became horrified that his name was associated with the device and petitioned the government to change its name. When this failed, his family changed their surname to escape the gruesome association.Sideburns — facial hair at the sides of the head, in front of the earWhile side whiskers have existed for centuries, sideburns got their name from the popular American general and politician Ambrose E. Burnside, who sported prominent mutton chops.This memorable style caught the public imagination and — despite his military failures during the Civil War in the 1860s — people soon referred it as \u0027burnsides\u0027.Over time the term was modified to sideburns — possibly because the hair concerned is on the side of the face.Maverick — someone who does things their own way          Samuel Augustus Maverick (pictured) was a lawyer and Texan landownerSamuel Augustus Maverick was a lawyer and Texan landowner, holding more than 385,000 acres. In 1845, he acquired 400 cattle as payment for a debt and Maverick, who had no ranching experience, took the unorthodox decision to leave the cattle unbranded and allowed them to wander across his vast estate. Unsurprisingly, when any strayed into another rancher\u0027s territory they were swiftly branded and claimed. Thus any unmarked cow became a \u0027Maverick\u0027. And maverick came to refer to a different way of doing things.Shrapnel — exploded fragments from the metal cases of artilleryHenry Shrapnel was a British Army officer who, in 1784, perfected the design for the exploding shell.           Henry Shrapnel (pictured) was a British Army officer who, in 1784, perfected the design for the exploding shellShrapnel thought he could make the cannon ball more deadly by filling a hollow shell with small metal balls, gunpowder and its own fuse. This would allow the shell to explode over the enemy.The Army adopted Shrapnel\u0027s invention in 1803 and it was used to devastating effect at Waterloo in 1815. Shrapnel shells were used until the beginning of World War II, when they were replaced by new highly explosive ammunition, sich as the Ordnance QF 25-Pounder. But \u0027shrapnel\u0027 was retained to describe the exploded metal from shell casings, which still wreak havoc on the battlefield.Diesel — a type of internal combustion engine a type of fuel          Rudolf Diesel (pictured) was a French–German engineer who invented the diesel engine in 1893Rudolf Diesel was a French–German engineer who invented the diesel engine in 1893.Compared to petrol engines, his compression-ignition design required much less fuel. The fuel, also cheaper to produce, became known as \u0027diesel\u0027 as well. Diesel did not live to see the huge success of his invention, which after World War I became the dominant engine in ships trucks and trains.Nicotine — the active ingredient in the leaf of the tobacco plant          Jean Nicot (pictured) was a French diplomat sent to Lisbon in 1557 to negotiate a marriageJean Nicot was a French diplomat sent to Lisbon in 1557 to negotiate a marriage between Margaret of Valois and King Sebastian I of Portugal. Although the trip was unsuccessful, he was introduced to the tobacco plant. Impressed, he sent seed samples to Catherine de Medici in France.Nicot instructed the queen how to crush the tobacco leaves into a powder, which could then be sniffed to cure ailments. The habit became popular at court before spreading across France.In 1753, Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus immortalised Nicot by naming a genus of tobacco \u0027cultivars Nicotiana\u0027. Later, in 1828 when the active ingredient in tobacco was first identified, it was given the name nicotine.

Mr Hammond’s suggestion that promised extra spending on public services and cuts to income tax are conditional on getting support for Theresa May’s Brexit deal could annoy some hardline Eurosceptics who are opposed to her plan‘If our businesses are no longer able to trade with European Union neighbours, if their supply chains are cut off, they will have to find different markets and different ways of doing business,’ he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. ‘The economy will change. It will have to restructure itself over a period of time and that will be a fairly major transition.’Mr Hammond – whose spending pledges are also expected to include extra cash for an extension of superfast broadband to remote rural areas and a temporary cut in business rates for small firms – indicated that further spending commitments would have to wait until the outcome of the Brexit negotiations is clear.‘Once we get a good deal from the European Union and the smooth exit from the EU, we will be able to show the British people that the fruits of their hard work are now at last in sight,’ he told the BBC.‘What I will be doing is setting out a path of public spending… but the detailed allocation to different departments is something that is for next year.’Mr Hammond’s suggestion that promised extra spending on public services and cuts to income tax are conditional on getting support for Theresa May’s Brexit deal could annoy some hardline Eurosceptics who are opposed to her plan.However, Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg welcomed the suggestion that no deal would lead to an overhaul of the economy.He told Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ‘This doesn’t sound like George Osborne’s punishment budget. Do you remember that we were going to get a punishment budget immediately after the referendum if we had the audacity to vote to leave?‘This sounds like an approach where policy decisions would be made to embrace Brexit and I’d be very much in favour of that being done on Monday rather than waiting a few months. I think we should be making announcements now about how we would deal with leaving on World Trade Organisation terms.’In her speech to the Tory party conference earlier this month, Mrs May pledged to end austerity. ‘Debt as a share of the economy will continue to go down, support for public services will go up,’ she said.‘Because, a decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over and that their hard work has paid off.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Publicity hungry Prince Harry gazumped father Charles present Radio 4s Today show","story":"    The Prince of Wales said it was ‘amazing’ that Harry, above, had listened to him at all. Harry then invited his father to be one of his interviewees, along with former U.S. President Barack ObamaNow, though, his father magnanimously withdrew to avoid any conflict.Perhaps as a compromise, Harry then invited his father to be one of his interviewees, along with former U.S. President Barack Obama.The Prince took full advantage of the media platform given to his ‘darling boy’ (as he referred to Harry on air) with aplomb.Is it the end for William and Harry\u0027s \u0027double act\u0027?

Strong tax receipts, the result of near full employment and consumer confidence, mean that the Chancellor has an extra £13billion of cash to play with However, Mr Hammond will need more than these windfalls to deliver on Prime Minister Theresa May’s announcement that austerity is over. And he’s not going to miss an opportunity to strengthen the public finances with new taxes.One possibility is that he will choose to freeze the personal allowances for income tax, pushing a larger number of people into higher tax bands.  In essence, it’s a sleight of hand, a hidden income tax increase, but it does break an election manifesto pledge not to raise income tax. Other targets include the tax relief granted for pensions savings, which Mr Hammond has described as ‘eye-wateringly’ generous. They particularly benefit more affluent households, and successive Chancellors have had them in their sights.          In essence, it’s a sleight of hand, a hidden income tax increase, but it does break an election manifesto pledge not to raise income taxA near certain target is contract workers in the private sector. They currently escape national insurance and income tax requirements by working as independent contractors. The measure, already applied to the public sector, could eventually raise up to £1billion for the Exchequer.A range of ‘sin taxes’ on offshore gambling, tobacco and alcohol are also expected.More controversial would be a rise in insurance premium tax, paid on car and home policies, and lowering the threshold at which firms start to pay VAT from the current figure of £85,000 – far higher than most of the EU.Of course, the most crowd-pleasing tax the Chancellor could impose would be on digital behemoths such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook, which earn billions of pounds in Britain but pay virtually no corporation or company taxes of any size.Mr Hammond wants to bring them within the tax net, possibly through a ‘user levy’, which would impose a charge for each click. But such a sophisticated levy will take some years to implement. As an interim measure the Treasury favours a tax on turnover or sales (as opposed to profits).Certainly, the Chancellor is going into the budget in a much stronger position than he could have hoped for just six months ago, courtesy of an economy that has expanded speedily enough to defy Project Fear and other gloomy forecasts about the impact of the EU referendum.However, as a Tory Chancellor he must not sacrifice the hard-won fiscal gains of a decade of austerity.Britain still has a legacy of £1.5trillion of national debt, which, at 86 per cent of national output, remains historically high. Yes, the debt is beginning to fall, but not fast enough for the Chancellor to release the handbrake without public finances going into reverse.

You have, in my view, been very, very naive.’Prosecutor Edmond Burge told the court: ‘Mr Attwater pleaded guilty at the close of all of the evidence following legal argument as to the status of his defence.Rouhani blasts \u0027misbehaving\u0027 Trump for cancelling nuclear...\u0027He’s got the maturity of an eight-year-old boy with the...Share this article‘Mrs Attwater falls into a slightly different position because she maintained her not guilty plea and was convicted by the jury.‘We cannot show that the Attwaters knew that the final destination of these goods was Iran.’George Hepburne-Scott, defending Mr Attwater, said: ‘This, I submit, is a truly exceptional case. Mr Attwater is 65 years old, he is an exemplary citizen.          The couple were \u0027groomed\u0027 into transporting prohibited goods into Iran, Southwark Crown Court (pictured) heard ‘He genuinely did not believe that these items could have a military application... these were nuts and bolts. He has also been completely open with the authorities. He has been extremely naive.’Judge Grieve told the Attwaters: ‘My ruling left you no defence as a point of law. Speaking directly to Mrs Attwater, he said: \u0027The jury convicted you unanimously after a short deliberation.\u0027He explained that in 2009, Customs officials blocked the exports of some of the goods which required a license ‘due to concerns about the production of weapons of mass destruction in Iran.‘Despite undertaking not to export these goods you proceeded again to send them out to Malaysia.‘These export controls might be confusing but they are there for a very good reason.‘That ultimate risk is one with potentially very serious humanitarian consequences. Such a consequence included use against others in nuclear weapons.’Mr Attwater agreed to sign a basis of plea prior to his formal guilty plea, in which he said: ‘I did not know or believe that goods or aircraft components would be shipped to Iran.‘I did not think there was even the remotest opportunity of these good ending up in a nuclear weapons program.’George, of Bristol, denied two counts of being knowingly concerned in the supply or delivery of controlled goods to an embargoed destination but was found guilty by a jury. Mr Attwater, of Telford, Shropshire, admitted being knowingly concerned in the exportation of goods with intent to evade prohibition or restriction. Mrs Attwater, also of Telford, pleaded not guilty but was convicted of the charge.They were both sentenced to six months jail suspended for 12 months and barred from being company directors for the next six years.Proceedings against George’s wife, Ruth, 74, were dropped after it ruled she had no case to answer.  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/796041dfc9f5d09e2195dc8fedac64d2d54730dd/0_39_4500_2699/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52f37e141bdd72f95fe4aa87e343b0c5","title":"scary stories halloween daniel mallory ortberg","story":"From The Haunting of Hill House to Matilda, spine-tingling tales to give you the shiversIf you want to spend an absolutely panicked evening writhing under a book, you can’t go wrong with Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House. It features one of the most memorable and deeply sympathetic horror protagonists I’ve ever come across, and has one of the best opening paragraphs in literature: “No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to dream. Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more. Within, walls continued upright, bricks met neatly, floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone. ” But, for all the new Netflix series, everyone only gets to read Jackson for the first time once. So if you’re an old Jackson hound but haven’t got round to her previous novel The Sundial, the tale of a monstrous family in another eerie house, it has as jarring a finale as anything she wrote.“I’ll bet I’m roughly as afraid of glass as is appropriate, as afraid of glass as a reasonable adult needs to be,” I’d have said before I’d read Jamaican-born Nalo Hopkinson’s “Under Glass” in her 2001 short story collection Skin Folk, in which a girl tries to outrun a glass-bearing windstorm before being flayed alive. I don’t say that any more. These eerie Caribbean folklore-inflected stories run from a version of “Little Red Riding Hood” through the tale of a terrifyingly outsize cockatrice to a post-apocalyptic world blighted by glass storms.The short story lends itself to horror at least in part because both require an economy of detail.. Slowly, Slowly in the Wind is a late-ish Patricia Highsmith collection, published in 1979, and while it’s a little uneven (the work of a miserable mid-century alcoholic 30 years into her career), nasty little treasures such as “Those Awful Dawns” make the journey worth it. This tale is a loosely reworked urban legend – bad, drug-addled parents an open medicine cabinet some unloved, curious children – in which dreadful but comic circumstances roll relentlessly downhill.Mary Shelley wrote Matilda in 1819-20, while on “the hearth of pale despair” after the deaths of her two young children. A young woman on her deathbed recalls the events that led to her father’s suicide, her own failing health and the blighting of all her hopes. With Frankenstein, Matilda and The Last Man, Shelley cornered the market in feverish meditations on choked-off isolation. Her father, William Godwin, found its incest themes “detestable” when she sent him Matilda to submit for publication. He never returned it to her, and it was published for the first time in 1959. It is brief and thudding, wonderfully frightening, and over almost before the first shock of discovery has worn off.I’m still terrified by Donald Sutherland’s expression on the poster for the film adaptation of Daphne du Maurier’s “Don’t Look Now”, originally from her 1971 collection Not After Midnight. As a whole, the collection isn’t any scarier than Rebecca or even Jamaica Inn, but it has got proper ghosts in it. The narrator of the titular story tries to tease out whether his compulsive drinking can be blamed on supernatural causes: “My complaint is universal, and has been so through the ages, an excuse for jest and hilarious laughter from earliest times, until one of us oversteps the mark and becomes a menace to society. Then we are given the boot. The passerby averts his gaze, and we are left to crawl out of the ditch alone, or stay there and die.” Maybe it does edge out Jamaica Inn, after all.• Daniel Mallory Ortberg’s The Merry Spinster: Tales of Everyday Horror is published by Corsair.

The industry, however, buoyed by record exports worth £600m last year, wants to more than double production by up to 400,000 tonnes by 2030.“Sepa is clear that compliance with environmental laws is non-negotiable,” said John Kenny, its acting head of compliance. The new regulations would “include more powerful modelling using the best available science, enhanced environmental monitoring, a new approach to sustainable siting of farms, and new approach for controlling the use of medicines”.The Scottish parliament’s rural economy committee is expected to issue a critical report in the coming days. It may stop short of backing calls for a moratorium but will urge ministers in Edinburgh to overhaul regulations.In March, Holyrood’s environment committee warned the industry’s expansion goal “will be unsustainable and may cause irrecoverable damage to the environment” unless standards improved markedly.“The status quo is not an option,” it said.At a salmon farm at Loch a’ Chàirn Bhàin, near Kylesku in the far north-west of Scotland, executives shepherding a group of fish merchants from Brixham were weary of the intense criticism their industry faces. Alban Denton, the managing director of Loch Duart, argued it already operated under the toughest regulatory regime of any livestock industry.It promotes “non-medicinal farming” where wrasse, a small fish that eats marine parasites, act as cleaner fish to peck off any sea lice on the salmon. The wrasse are harvested from the wild sustainably, the firm says, living in artificial reefs made from sliced up black plastic in a corner of each salmon cage.Yet wrasses’ role as a highly sought after solution to sea lice infestation has pushed its price as high as £50,000 a tonne – the most expensive by weight in Europe. Loch Duart suspended one supplier in south-west England earlier this month for allegedly fishing in a no-catch zone.Rather than treated with the copper-based antifoulants standard in the industry, its cages are air-dried to remove algae. They occasionally use hydrogen peroxide or fresh water baths to treat amoebic gill disease, which has at times plagued some farms.Its farms lie empty, or fallow, for five months rather than an industry norm of five weeks, to allow the seabed to recover and suppress sea lice numbers. They say that combination of tactics works: on the eight cages on Loch a’ Chàirn Bhàin, six have been entirely sea lice free this year, and two had negligible numbers.It has had serious issues with sea lice in the past, and has shot seals too, under licences that conservationists believe are too lax.“One of our first tests of sustainability when I started this company was whether we would be doing this in 100 or 200 years’ time,” Bing said. “If we had unsustainable fish food, we would run out if our stocking policy damaged the seabed we would have our licence revoked.”Instead, its whole fish are mostly exported to Michelin-starred restaurants in France, where they have won the coveted Label Rouge quality marque, or exclusive sushi restaurants in San Francisco and Manhattan.The challenge for the multinationals that collectively own most of Scotland’s salmon farms, for regulators such as Sepa, and ministers, is to decide where the balance lies, said Andrew Graham-Stewart, of Salmon and Trout Conservation Scotland. It campaigns to protect wild salmon and trout stocks, which are threatened by escapes of farmed fish and the sea lice they attract.Do they want to promote cheap supermarket salmon or properly protect the environment, and the fish being farmed?“The industry is at a crossroads. Scottish ministers need to decide whether they’re going to continue to allow the industry to expand without all the major issues associated with it being properly addressed,” he said. “If they fail to address these issues then the natural environment in the west Highlands and islands will continue to be effectively and systematically destroyed.”Ian Roberts, a spokesman for Norwegian-owned Marine Harvest, which produced nearly a third of Scotland’s record salmon yield of 190,000 tonnes last year, said the firm would embrace tighter regulations. His firm had made mistakes in the past, but fish farming was here to stay, he said.“If we’re going to feed a growing population expecting healthy food we will be farming in the future,” he said. “We want regulations that are going to secure our business and properly manage our business, because we want to be here in the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/927e9d1b58896836828d12de737fc4ba5d252b57/0_94_1584_950/master/1584.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab0fc1a4912bca9e301371c117d9db19","title":"brazil election far right democracy social media","story":"As goes Brazil, so goes democracy? It is no good outsiders pouring contempt on Jair Bolsonaro, victor in Sunday’s Brazilian presidential election. He is the choice of his people. For non-Brazilians, it is what he represents, not what he says, that matters.Brazil has been one of the world’s most exciting emergent nations, yet its evolution over 30 years from dictatorship to hesitant democracy seems to have stalled. Bolsonaro has exploited the oldest politics, that of self-interest, and also the newest, that of anger, polarisation and fear. Voters have stomached his distaste for gay people, feminism, rainforests and the rule of law, to rid themselves of a corrupt leftwing regime unable to contain street violence. A famously tolerant nation has opted for military and economic discipline.In any country, the apparent breakdown of social order will drive voters to extremism. This message has proved popular around the world, from Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, Viktor Orbán of Hungary, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey, even America’s Donald Trump. Liberal values, however defined, will not survive when their defenders cannot transmit their virtues to voters.The lesson for champions of open democracy is glaring. Its values cannot be taken for granted. When debate is no longer through regulated media, courts and institutions, politics will default to the mob. Social media – once hailed as an agent of global concord – has become the purveyor of falsity, anger and hatred. Its algorithms polarise opinion. Its pseudo-information drives argument to the extremes. Even an apparently stable democracy such as Germany this week finds its centrist consensus torn apart, as the electorate ides between far right and radical left.Born in Glicério in São Paulo in 1955 to parents of Italian descent, he served in the army from 1971 until 1988, when he was elected as a city councillor in Rio de Janeiro for the Christian Democratic party. In 1990, he became a federal congressman for the same party. He has since been affiliated with a number of political parties. On 22 July, he was officially nominated as the presidential candidate of the Social Liberal party.Bolsonaro espouses populist and nationalist views that often stray into far-right territory.\u0026nbsp A vocal opponent of same-sex marriage, abortion, immigration and other progressive causes, he has defended the death penalty and the 1964-85 military dictatorship. On foreign policy, he has said he wants to improve relations with the US. Economically he says he is pro free market and privatisation.\u0026nbspDeliberately provocative and polarising. He has praised Gen Pinochet, expressed support for torturers and called for political opponents to be shot, earning him\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbsplabel\u0026nbspof the most misogynistic, hateful elected official in the democratic world”.\u0026nbsp In his bid to capitalise on Latin America’s lurch to the right, he paints himself as a tropical Donald Trump: a pro-gun, anti-establishment crusader set on draining the swamp and cracking down on violent crime.On top of repeated calls for a return to dictatorship, he has made equally inflammatory attacks on\u0026nbspwomen,\u0026nbspblack people,\u0026nbspgay people, foreigners and indigenous communities. Earlier this year,\u0026nbsphe was charged by the attorney general with inciting hate speech.\u0026nbspEvery continent is now seeing the emergence of (mostly) rightwing disrupters. They appeal to those who feel excluded by “identity politics”, by what they perceive as liberal pandering to minorities. They feed on religious intolerance and on neighbourhood insecurity. They spit anger at any form of establishment. Yapping in their van are the jackals of social media, spreading fear.In the light of the rise of the new right, it is not enough for liberals to stay silent. Lies and hatred cannot be purveyed across the globe for profit. Hysteria and anger cannot become standard political discourse. The boring modalities of democracy – regulating elections, curbing censorship, taming extremism, fighting corruption – all matter crucially.Democratic leadership is becoming inured to moderation. Britain is no exception. What should be a sensible debate over trade policy has become polarised and polluted with anger. Coalition and compromise appear impossible. The outcome could yet be disastrous. That is the message of Brazil."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4bc855e40d6917ec52b67f9f725b10b98dbd625/0_121_2545_1527/master/2545.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3804287eea70e5097c49ecd859fac9fa","title":"budget brexit philip hammond uk eu commons","story":"Philip Hammond will deliver the last budget before the UK leaves the EU not knowing if it will get through the CommonsImagine being the chief financial officer of a corporation whose headquarters is squarely in the path of a high-category hurricane. You are delivering your annual statement to the principal shareholders, many of whom think it would be a good idea to get out of the way of the whirlwind. Others, mysteriously, dismiss the strong advice of “expert” meteorologists and insist that the hurricane will somehow be good for the business, liberating its full potential as it tears the building from its very foundations. Yet another group – the Jeremy and John Consortium – thinks that the battering storm will enable them to transform the business and collectivise its assets.This is pretty much what it will be like for Philip Hammond when he stands up on Monday to deliver his third budget, the last before Hurricane Brexit hits the United Kingdom on 29 March. By definition, the chancellor of the day is always the cabinet’s party-pooper, the minister whose task it is to contain the spending ambitions of his departmental colleagues.But there is a special loathing reserved for Hammond. Many of his fellow cabinet ministers seethe about him in private with a ferocity that is simply not warranted by his love of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and aversion to political showboating. No: senior Tories hate Hammond because he challenges their magical thinking about Brexit, their faith that our departure from the EU will be a triumph of the will if we dare to embrace the power of positive thinking. Tediously, laboriously, but entirely correctly, the chancellor maintains that bravado and conviction have nothing to do with it: Brexit will be a highly technical, operational matter, not an exercise in pageantry and rightwing performance art.Still, he is obliged, ex officio, not to panic and to deliver a budget that as far as possible cleaves to the rules of normal service. As ever, a series of measures has been heavily trailed before his speech: additional defence spending, a fresh box of sticking plasters for universal credit, help for rough sleepers, money for broadband, a boost for the UK’s beleaguered high streets, an extra £420m for potholes and – pure bathos – the announcement of a review to enable couples to be married in the open air. Next Conservative slogan: Britain Just Got Wetter.There has also been speculation that the chancellor will raise income tax thresholds in 2019 – a year earlier than planned. That would certainly be consistent with the fiscal strategy adopted by the Conservatives since the formation of the Cameron-Clegg coalition eight years ago. But it would sit uneasily alongside Theresa May’s promise in her party conference speech that austerity “is over”.Hammond might argue, with much evidence on his side, that revenues increase when tax thresholds rise and rates fall. But this is a very difficult argument to make politically at a time when so many are feeling the full impact of eight years of cuts – with more to come.From Hammond’s interview on Sunday with the BBC’s Andrew Marr, it was clear that the chancellor wants to postpone as many serious decisions as possible until next year’s spending review. Who can blame him? For better or worse, the moment of departure from the EU will be in the rearview mirror: whoever is chancellor will at least have the measure of what is happening, and a sense of the depth of the economic craters (or the height of the sunlit uplands if, against all logic, the Brexiteers prove to be right).As for this budget, Hammond cannot even be sure that it will get through the Commons. The Democratic Unionist party, whose 10 MPs prop up this minority government, have been explicit in their warning that they may vote against the finance bill if they are unsatisfied by May’s negotiating position on the Irish border. This would be, to use the cliche, a nuclear option. But we are living in one of those phases in politics where cliches regain their original force. It is now more than conceivable that the DUP, perhaps in alliance with a few hard Brexiteer Tory MPs, could vote down the budget.So shrunken and petty does politics seem these days that it is easy to neglect the scale of what is at stake. Even as we approach the greatest single change in our institutional and commercial arrangements since the second world war, there is a parallel ideological conflict over the very nature of the state and citizenship. Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell want a very different system, with nationalisation and Keynesian borrowing, taxation and expenditure at its heart. The Conservatives still stand for fiscal conservatism, moderated to a greater or lesser extent by the occasional spree.This is indeed an important and necessary debate: the role of the state in the 21st century will certainly change as automation means that there is less work for us to do as we live longer, and as the inequalities of globalisation become ever more intolerable. Yet our political class, as presently configured, is not up to the task of this dual conversation: it is seriously overstretched, tested way past its enfeebled civic capacity. There is terrible weakness on both sides of the dispatch box.Yes, Labour is (up to a point) defining the battle of ideas, but – to judge, at least, by the opinion polls – it is nowhere near where it needs to be electorally. The Tory minority government could be accused of playground politics – though that would be grossly unfair to the children in most playgrounds. The system is dangerously close to overload. Hammond will doubtless be as smooth as ever. But all around him will fizz and fly the sparks of a political circuitry that may soon be ablaze."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10effa7dfc99ebc3aea29e1072a7e03ba46f5ef9/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5be87c0798f1d3827ff6980f93dfc0a6","title":"northern irish voters theresa may dup arlene foster brexit","story":"The Democratic Unionist party is defined by its hostility to the Republic of Ireland. For the DUP the political crisis of Brexit has generated a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take back control of Northern Ireland. It seems that it will do this even if it entails destroying the Good Friday agreement and defying the wishes of a substantial majority of its own electorate.This is evident from the remarks of the party’s leader, Arlene Foster, on the fringe of the Tory party conference this month. The 1998 agreement is not “sacrosanct”, she said, and “could evolve” into something different in the context of the UK’s departure from the EU. Foster also told a sympathetic newspaper how it was “deeply frustrating to hear people who voted remain and in Europe talk about Northern Ireland as though we can’t touch the Belfast agreement”.Earlier in the year the party had sought to use its leverage in the Commons to rework legislation which the responsible minister said was “a cornerstone of the Belfast agreement”.None of this should be in the least surprising. The current leaders of the party founded by Ian Paisley are defined by the break he made with mainstream unionism over the Good Friday agreement – it is the DUP’s main calling card, the reason it has successfully crushed the rest of political unionism. Under its “leadership” the devolved structures of government created by that agreement have ground to a halt. And to make matters worse various cross-border initiatives, both fostered by and developed since it came into effect, are now threatened by the hardest of hard borders that the DUP’s Brexit fanatics at Westminster (a cult within a cult) seem determined to embrace. The electoral lottery has awarded the DUP a potential prize it seems determined to claim. Ireland’s defeat is their victory even if, as with Shelley’s Ozymandias, “nothing beside remains”.It has been reported that Theresa May refuses to meet with Northern Ireland’s non-unionist political representatives as a group. The four political parties that requested a joint meeting – Sinn Féin, the SDLP, the Alliance, and the Green party – represent a remain opinion in Northern Ireland that delivered a strong vote for the EU in the 2016 referendum.Northern Ireland business agrees: local CBI chair Trevor Lockhart recently wrote to May on behalf of 21 signatory organisations warning of the grave concern felt by business at the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, now coming much more plausibly into view in light of the refusal of any compromise on the Irish backstop – a position rendered intractable by DUP intransigence. Lockhart, who admits that he may himself have to move his business south to the Republic of Ireland, is clear that (as he told the Financial Times) the concerns felt by business are “cross-sectoral and … cross-community”. That point is further attested to by opinion polling in the province published by Queen’s University Belfast in July.With its opposition to Brexit combining with its views on the rights of women, gay people and much else, the DUP undoubtedly presents to many in Britain as an absurd throwback to a nasty time of sectarian politics and evangelical reaction. Views towards it in the Republic of Ireland are probably the same indeed the state has liberated itself from a conservative Catholic dominance whose social policy priorities are now to be found (irony of ironies) only within the ranks of the Rome-hating DUP. It cannot be stated often enough that this is also how the DUP present to very many in Northern Ireland as well, perhaps (as the numbers above indicate) even a majority.It was the 17th-century Protestant preacher Thomas Fuller who seems to have been the first to say that “the darkest hour is just before the dawn”. It has been so in the Republic, where reaction to a series of awful events and discoveries about the past helped propel the country to its brighter present. Brexit has pushed the non-unionist parties into important progressive alliances: on business, the border and rights (the last of these especially vulnerable after Brexit). Might the crisis of Brexit be about to present Northern Ireland with a chance to transcend the ancient green-orange ide?May should meet with the Northern Ireland remain parties with more votes than their DUP opponents, and throw in Lockhart and Swann for good measure. It will at very least make a change from dreary exchanges of red lines with the 10 DUP MPs to which she is beholden.

How many passersby ever look up at that tiny red circle and think about the awful day when “a peaceful rally of 60,000 pro-democracy reformers, men, women and children, was attacked by armed cavalry resulting in 15 deaths and over 600 injuries”?The massacre’s imminent 200th anniversary is already being marked by a piece of art that restores not just Peterloo’s flesh, blood and raw passions, but a vivid sense of what it says about the country where it happened, both then and now. Mike Leigh’s film Peterloo, released this Friday, is two and a half hours long and clearly a labour of love. It’s a little too heavy on clunky dialogue that makes even minor asides sound like political speeches, and so determined to cover the breadth of its story that it loses any real sense of human intimacy. But thanks to its depiction of a time of revolution, war and economic depression, its evocation of Manchester at the start of the Industrial Revolution, and its amazing staging of the massacre itself, what it says most plainly is undeniable: this mattered.In the buildup to the film’s release, there have been one or two rumblings to the contrary. In a column written for the Times in August, the writer and Conservative peer Daniel Finkelstein responded to Leigh’s insistence that Peterloo was “a major, major event” and ought to be a compulsory part of the national curriculum. Peterloo, said Finkelstein, “was not the beginning of anything much”. Britain’s modern history, moreover, “was shaped in factories and parliament and not on the street”. He went on: “Mike Leigh is arguing that because all pupils are taught about 1066, the Magna Carta, the wives of Henry VIII, the French Revolution and Waterloo they should all learn about Peterloo. And this equivalence is simply wrong.”I am not a huge fan of columns about other columns, but this deserves a response. Whether this country’s slow and fitful embrace of democracy originated in “the street” is a moot point, but it certainly happened thanks to the pressure exerted by an ever more engaged population, and developments that occurred far away from centres of power. People’s demands for a meaningful political voice stretched back to the great sprouting of radical and deeply egalitarian thinking that happened in and around the English civil war, and on to the ferment on this side of the channel that took root in the wake of the French Revolution: reform societies and political unions, ever-larger outdoor meetings, the large readerships that feasted on Thomas Paine’s Rights of Man and William Cobbett’s weekly Political Register.In that sense, Peterloo – the name, first written as “Peter-Loo”, was coined by the editor of a weekly paper called the Manchester Observer – does not demand attention solely because of what happened on one day, but because of a much longer story that fed into the events of 16 August 1819, and then extended beyond them.The foundation of this newspaper– then called the Manchester , and established in the aftermath of Peterloo to “warmly advocate the cause of Reform” – is part of this story. Chartism flared to life 15 years later. Trade unions eventually began to break through in the 1850s the expansion of the electorate was marked by the passage of legislation in 1832, 1867, 1884, 1918 and 1928.These changes may have happened at a glacial pace, but not so slowly that we can’t look beyond their datelines and identify events that set the stage: the huge meetings that happened in 1816 at Spa Fields in north London, and teetered into riots the “reform riots” of 1831 in Bristol, Nottingham and Derby, and demonstrations around the same time in London and Birmingham the huge Chartist gatherings at Kersal Moor, in Salford, in 1838 and 1839 the latter year’s Newport Rising.These things form a kind of shadow history of 19th-century Britain, which still has far too little purchase on this country’s shared sense of its past. Peterloo was pre-eminent among them, not least because it confirmed that reformers had an unanswerable moral case, while the authorities were exposed as the defenders of brute privilege. There is, moreover, another chronically overlooked aspect of the way August 1819 opened a path to the future: the fact that in the period leading up to the massacre, women’s reform societies had sprung up around the north-west, formed to support the fight for male suffrage, but also responsible for the innovation of women voting alongside men at radical gatherings. They attracted no end of abuse, but women reformers were defiantly on the platform at St Peter’s Field. In a just-published book about the massacre, the historical writer Jacqueline Riding says that what they did represented “the earliest example of organised female activity in British politics”.Peterloo also shines unflattering light on some of our laziest national myths. Over the past 15 years or so, we have got used to politicians describing Britain – or England – as a country that has always exuded “decency, tolerance and a sense of fair play”. By contrast, Thompson saw 1819’s carnage originating in “the panic of class hatred” and an ingrained belief that any working class crowd was always only a breath away from turning into the mob – something that has regularly surfaced long into the democratic age: witness Orgreave or Hillsborough. Another point, even more overlooked, is bound up with the same tendency of authority to tip into brutality: the fact that Peterloo saw the violence meted out by British colonialists unexpectedly returning home, and pointed ahead to some of the empire’s bloodiest episodes.One other lesson runs through Peterloo and its legacy: the ruling class is not some phantasm of lefty demonology, but a real thing – and, even in the 21st century, its most essential features remain. Its leading lights are still hopelessly stubborn and attached to the glories of fighting the last war. As evidenced by a long story that takes in everything from the poverty of the 1930s to the Conservative party’s birthing and the bungling of Brexit, they must always get things horribly wrong before they are close to getting them even half right.Watching Leigh’s film, there was a moment when some minor character was voicing reactionary opinions with florid humbug, and I instantly pictured the former foreign secretary these days trying to sell us some half-cocked vision of our national destiny. Boris Johnson, in fact, is a creature seemingly plucked from a cartoon by the Georgian artist George Cruikshank – and a man whose infamous purchase of German water cannon while he was the mayor of London highlighted a fear of the mob that any student of the 19th century would recognise instantly.The kind of history that now seems to dominate our culture is too often centred on kings, queens and powerful men, something lately seen in the revival of the cult of Winston Churchill. Peterloo and everything that followed it were the products of things that were much more profound: disjunctions between systems of power and the new industrial economy, and the fact that among the first people to live out those contradictions and demand their resolution were the thousands who gathered in St Peter’s Field.Put another way, this country’s journey into democracy was a product of the wisdom of crowds. There, not in ministries and mansions, is where social progress always originates, and in times as uncertain as ours, we would do well to remember it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7381f3d025b6c98c327fd89ee032bd6cec13b5bf/92_1439_5462_3278/master/5462.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a27e0ecdebc7fae1f3277106705dfb38","title":"question dreaded dating what do in spare time arwa mahdawi","story":"There would always be that awkward moment when you’ve just met someone new. But I think I have a fix for that nowOne of the best things about being in a relationship, I have decided, is no longer having to go on dates where you are asked the inevitable question: “What do you like to do in your spare time?”It should be an easy thing to answer, shouldn’t it? It’s not as if someone is asking for a mathematical explanation of the mass gap. It’s not as if someone has asked you to describe, in iambic pentameter, why Ed Sheeran is so popular. They are just asking you what you like to do in your spare time.The problem, however, is that I have no idea how to answer. When I was a child, I had hobbies. I liked to collect rocks. I liked to go rock climbing. You know, all the normal things a socially awkward child likes to do. But hobbies are more complicated as an adult. The things I enjoy doing most (sleeping, mainly) can’t really be classed as hobbies. They are just normal human activities that normal humans do. When I cast around for the slightly more unusual pastimes I enjoy, they are not exactly things you can share with first dates. For example, I really enjoy making bonfires. But telling a girl you just met off Tinder that you love starting fires generally does not result in a second date.For anyone else who may be struggling with this issue, I have got your back! I have recently come up with a brilliant (if I say so myself) hobby-hack. If you want to turn the most mundane of activities into an impressive-sounding hobby, just put the words “intermittent”, “extreme” or “experimental” in front of it. Saying “I enjoy napping”, for example, makes you sound lazy. But saying “I enjoy intermittent napping” sounds science-y and intriguing. Experimental napping is even better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b59e9660a14f56e182e4012605fad0c4b31933e/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c00c6f04856665ded758ae710f528f70","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of towering","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘towering’The closing date is Wednesday 31 October at 10am.

This is inexcusable – every child should be able to breathe clean air so they can grow and fulfil their potential.”The findings coincide with the start of the first global conference on air pollution and health in Geneva, including a high-level action day at which nations and cities are expected to make new commitments to cut air pollution.The WHO study found that children are particularly vulnerable to air pollution because pollutants are often more concentrated nearer to ground level. It added that their developing organs and nervous system are also more susceptible to long-term damage than those of adults.“Air pollution is stunting our children’s brains, affecting their health in more ways than we suspected,” said Dr Maria Neira, WHO director of public health and the environment.Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable, with dirty air linked to premature and underweight children. Air pollution also increases the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease later in life.Tedros, writing in the  on Saturday, described air pollution as the “new tobacco”, saying the simple act of breathing is killing 7 million people a year and harming billions more.In the UK, most urban areas have illegal levels of air pollution and ministers have lost three times in the high court after challenges over the inadequacy of their action. The latest government action plan, called “pitiful” by environmental lawyers, revealed air pollution was actually much worse than previously feared.Globally, with smoking on the decline, air pollution now causes more deaths annually than tobacco. However, researchers think the harm known to be caused by air pollution, such as heart attacks and lung disease, is only “the tip of the iceberg”.Today’s report found that both indoor and outdoor air pollution was causing significant health problems. It said burning fuel such as wood or paraffin for heating, cooking and light in poorer countries was having a drastic impact on children’s health and called on governments to promote the clean alternatives as a matter of urgency.Mark Watts, executive director of the C40 Cities group, which represents cities around the world working to tackle the climate crisis and air pollution, said the report was an urgent call to action.“The moral and practical case for urgent, bold and far-reaching action to reduce emissions, including calling an end to the fossil fuel era, is now utterly irrefutable,” he said.“Citizens are demanding action to protect their children, mayors of the world’s big cities are regulating to take dirty vehicles off the streets and slash emissions from buildings and waste. Now is the moment for governments, car manufacturers and other big polluters to step up.”Neira said the air pollution crisis and the climate emergency could only be tackled together.“The solutions are a basic public health agenda that will have plenty of benefits for public health and the environment,” she said. “No matter what else, we know that we need to decarbonise our society sooner rather than later and the benefits of that for our health and our economy are indisputable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/729dd0871f01bdd7ce87063bfa1b15dd79dfd195/0_79_2626_1576/master/2626.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=904fb603a6c978a92642306c1a39299f","title":"thousands of ships could dump pollutants at sea to avoid dirty fuel ban","story":"Owners planning to install ‘emissions cheat’ systems to avoid having to buy cleaner, more expensive fuelThousands of ships are set to install “emissions cheat” systems that pump pollutants into the ocean to beat new international rules banning dirty fuel.The move comes after growing concerns about the health impacts of shipping emissions. A report in Nature this year said 400,000 premature deaths a year are caused by emissions from dirty shipping fuel, which also account for 14 million childhood asthma cases per year.But the move to cleaner fuel could see harmful pollutants increasingly dumped at sea.According to industry analysis seen by the , between 2,300 and 4,500 ships are likely to install an exhaust gas cleaning system known as a scrubber to meet the regulations on low-sulphur fuel instead of buying the more expensive clean fuel.The scrubbers allow ship owners to continue buying cheaper high-sulphur fuel, which is washed onboard in the scrubber. In the case of the most used system, known as open loop, the waste water is discharged into the ocean.Although expensive at around $2-4m per ship fitting, the cost of buying and fitting a scrubber would be recovered in the first year, the industry analysis says.Cleaner low-sulphur fuel is likely to cost between $300 and $500 more a tonne, according to analysts.Ned Molloy, an independent shipping analyst, said that although the scrubbers were allowed by the IMO as a way to meet the lower-sulphur emissions rules, they were little more than an “environmental dodge”.Molloy said the scrubbers that had so far been fitted on the global fleet in advance of the 2020 deadline were all open-loop systems, which discharge into the sea, rather than the more expensive closed-loop systems, which require storage of waste water to be discharged into a facility on shore.“This is sulphurous waste going into the sea,” he said. “It would be illegal to just dump this anywhere on land anywhere in the EU, except in specialist facilities.“There is growing concern, particularly in EU countries, about whether open-loop scrubbers should be allowed.”Pollutants in the wash water include particulate matter and sulphur, as well as metals including lead, nickel and zinc.A study by the German environment agency, the UBA, in 2015 said: “The use of scrubbers causes environmental degradation through short-term and spatially limited Ph value reduction … increase in temperature and turbidity as well as pollutant discharge of sometimes persistent materials.”In its report the UBA said the use of cleaner fuel was preferable to treating high-sulphur fuel in a scrubber.The IMO low-sulphur regulations – confirmed this week – included an amendment that spelled out that scrubbers can be used to meet the emissions restrictions.“The … amendment will prohibit the carriage of non-compliant fuel oil – unless the ship has an exhaust gas cleaning system (‘scrubber’) fitted,” the IMO agreed.Many predict the rush to install scrubbers will increase in pace as the deadline approaches. Last month Star Bulk, a shipping firm based in Athens, announced it was going to equip its whole fleet with open-loop scrubbers by 2020. Such is the concern about the environmental impact of scrubbers that some national governments ban the discharge of wash water within their ports.The UN’s own advisers, the joint group of experts on the scientific aspects of marine environmental protection, have warned that increasing numbers of vessels using scrubbers by 2020 could lead to a potential increased risk and possible unintended consequences to the marine aquatic environment.The IMO is reviewing the guidelines on discharging wash water from scrubbers after requests from several countries including the UK, Germany and the Netherlands that want sampling to improve so the environmental impact of discharging the waste water is better understood."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2e560e9176067a868eb6cb832f605bdebe85f8f/0_0_1181_939/master/1181.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5402edd8a40664ac1afe669eda2cc195 480w","title":"montgomery clift actor untold story hollywood","story":"In a new documentary, myths and assumptions about the Oscar-nominated heartthrob who struggled with his sexuality are replaced with the little-known truth For over 30 years, scripts have floated around Hollywood promising to tell the story of Montgomery Clift, one of the most innovative and handsome actors in history. Tellingly, they’re always pitched under working titles like ‘Beautiful Loser’ and\u0027 ‘Tragic Beauty’. Guided by the key biographies of Clift, they reliably parrot a narrative which paints the actor as a startlingly attractive and prodigiously gifted man who, according to one notably overheated tabloid TV show “became a drug-addicted alcoholic living in a self-imposed hell because he had a secret he couldn’t live with”.That “secret” – that Clift was gay during an impossible era (the 1930s through the 60s) – led many interpreters to conclude that the actor must have led a life riddled with fear and shame. It hardly helped lend nuance to that reading that Clift was a well-known and long-time abuser of pain killers and alcohol, actions which likely sped his death from a heart attack at 45 in 1966. Yet, according to a new documentary, titled Making Montgomery Clift, the star’s substance abuse had nothing at all to do with his sexuality. In fact, the attitudes he and his family held towards his relationships with men were strikingly modern.The movie, which plays at the LGBTQ movie festival NewFest in New York, refutes scores of oft-repeated assumptions about Clift’s life, from his motivations as an actor, to his relationship with his mother to the characterization of his later years. It also stresses Clift’s crucial role in changing the power balance between actors and studio chiefs in Hollywood, as well as the advancements he brought to film acting. More, it analyzes the new view of masculine beauty he helped introduce to the screen.To help build their case, the film-makers had rare access to the actor’s archives, as well as to the family’s story, courtesy of a special connection: the doc was co-directed by the star’s nephew, Robert Clift, and his wife, Hillary Demmon. “For us, it seemed there was this big difference between what people thought about Monty in the public sphere and what people that knew him would say,” said Clift. “I wanted to figure out why there was such a difference.”A deep trove of never-before-revealed evidence makes that disparity bracingly clear. For somewhat mysterious reasons, Robert Clift’s father Brooks taped endless conversations with his famous brother, as well as with their mother and other figures relevant to the story. (The director himself never met his famous uncle, having been born eight years after his death). In one tape made by his father in the 1960s, we hear the star’s mother tell him, with untroubled candor, that “Monty was a homosexual early. I think he was 12 or 13.”“It’s obviously a non-issue for her,” co-director Demmon said. “That’s not what people would expect from a mother in that period.”Then again, nothing about Clift’s life was expected. Born in 1920 in Omaha, Nebraska, Clift was raised like an aristocrat, with a private tutor and frequent trips to Europe. While he never excelled at school, his extraordinary abilities as an actor showed early. By 15, Clift made his Broadway debut in Cole Porter’s Jubilee. Over the next 10 years, he earned prominent roles in plays by Tennessee Williams and Thornton Wilder, opposite stars like Fredrick March and Tallulah Bankhead. Hollywood repeatedly came courting, but he put off offers for nearly a decade, even turning down roles in classic films like East of Eden and the co-lead in Sunset Boulevard.Taped interviews with his brother reveal that the actor felt those roles weren’t quite right for him and he didn’t want to make the wrong first impression. He also didn’t want to sign a contract with a studio, then the only viable way into the business. “He didn’t want the studios to dictate the kinds of roles he would play,” his nephew said. “He wanted to be a free agent, and he did it successfully. The old Hollywood system was breaking apart and he was a major part of that.”The first role Clift took, opposite John Wayne in Red River in 1948, offered a stark contrast in masculine presentations. Clift detested Wayne’s antiquated male constraints. He also detested the man. “Monty brought a different masculinity to the screen,” said Demmon. “Here was someone who was vulnerable and sensitive - and who actually listened to women.”He wasn’t the only one who challenged such norms at the time. Contemporaries like James Dean and Marlon Brando also did. Like them, Clift was comfortable with the full contours, and consequences, of his beauty, playing “the object” in a way previously preserved for female stars. He also helped bring a more natural acting style to film. “That’s why his work doesn’t feel dated,” Demmon said.He advanced a collaborative approach with his directors, working over scripts and making suggestions for edits. “He wasn’t solely an actor,” she said. “He had a holistic view.”Observers also point out that Clift had sexual relationships with women. But, in general, his relationships with men had more to do with sex than with a deep emotional connection. A seeming exception was one in his final years with a man named Lorenzo who had been hired to help him. “They went to London to see Laurence Olivier together, ate together, sat in front of the fire together,” Clift said. “Lorenzo came into the picture when Monty was at his lowest. He got him going again. He still drank, but not as heavily. Lorenzo was one of the reasons.”Clift asserts that the actor’s use of alcohol and prescription drugs stemmed, primarily, from a near-fatal car accident in 1956. He used them to numb his physical pain. The accident changed his appearance, and many biographers assumed Clift felt ruined by it and, so, drank more. But the documentary notes Clift made as many movies after the accident as before, and that those projects included some of his most acclaimed performances. Ex-lover Larson said in the film that Clift actually preferred his work after the accident to his performances before.Many of the myths surrounding Clift sprang from two biographies: a salacious one by Robert Laguardia and another flawed work by Patricia Bosworth, titled A Life. The film-makers interviewed Bosworth extensively for the movie, but they contrast her words with old taped conversations she had with the actor’s brother. He pleaded with her to make changes to her book to correct the mischaracterizations. While she sounds apologetic, the changes were never made.As to why Bosworth drew on the gay-self-hate narrative, and why that view took hold, the directors blame the homophobia of the time the book was written, in the 1970s. “The view then about queer people was that they would be inherently conflicted or tormented about their sexuality,” said Demmon. “If you have a story that tracks along that line, that will feel true to people. Which gives that narrative a lot of traction. Now we’re at a historical point in mainstream queer discourse where that story seems less viable.”Though the film aims to update, and to fairly contextualize, the actor’s story, the directors stress that they don’t want to simply swap one image of Montgomery Clift for another. “We’re not trying to give a definitive version of who Monty was,” added Clift. “Part of honoring someone is being open to that person not being just one, reductive thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e86c173128e70d60772e0189e7397961571db808/0_1308_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ef2863be496f53e9b9116d4a4810471","title":"chocolate chip cookies gingernuts biscuits yotam ottolenghi claire ptak","story":"Delicate tuiles to impress your guests and chocolate chip cookies for the kids – our pick of the best biscuits to make at homeThis is the ideal way to use up extra egg whites when I’ve made mayo or cured eggs.

I caution you to set up your cooling operation in a no-traffic zone – I once spent hours baking more than a hundred tuiles for a charity dinner. Every whack of a cleaver, every footstep, sent some of the fragile tiles to the floor. We christened the replacement batch “floor tiles” because we opted to leave them flat. This sensible alternative tastes the same and precludes calamity.For about 28salted butter 2 tbsp caster sugar 55g sliced almonds 70g plain flour 2 tbsp egg whites 60ml (1-2) salt ⅛ tspPreheat the oven to 200Cgas mark 6. Set a mixing bowl near or on the oven to warm through.Melt the butter in a pan over low heat, and monitor it as it turns a pale hazelnut colour and releases its nutty fragrance. Promptly pour into the warm mixing bowl. Add the sugar, almonds, flour and egg whites, and stir and fold gently to combine. Don’t beat. Add the salt and taste. It should taste salty-sweet. The batter will be viscous, ropey and glossy.Spoon 1 heaped teaspoonful of the batter onto a nonstick cookie sheet and use a fork to spread it into a rough 7.5cm circle, barely thicker than a slice of almond. Try to scoop about half almonds, half batter for each tuile, and dip the fork into a glass of water between efforts, to keep it from “grabbing” the batter as you spread it into translucent puddles. The batter will spread a little more as it bakes, so leave 2.5cm between each puddle. You can fit about 9 tuiles on a 35cm-square baking sheet.Bake until the cookies are mottled golden in the centre and tea coloured on the edges, about 3-5 minutes. Because many ovens don’t bake evenly, the cookies may not either. Watch and either rotate the cookie sheet to correct for this or remove any tuiles that brown much more quickly than the rest.Pull the sheet from the oven and immediately transfer the tuiles one by one to the chosen cooling spot with a thin-bladed metal spatula. If the cookies start to stick before you get them all off the sheet, you need only return it to the oven for long enough to remelt the caramelised sugar, then peel them off while they are still pliable. Wipe the baking sheet clean between batches. (To speed up production, you may want to use two sheets, spreading the batter on the second one while the first set of cookies bakes.)The caramelised sugar will readily grab humidity out of the air, which could quickly soften the cookies and collapse their curves, so as soon as they are cool, place the tuiles, cantilevered like roof tiles, in an airtight container.NOTE If you don’t have a nonstick baking sheet, use a heavy-gauge regular sheet, brushed with clarified unsalted butter. Wipe and rebutter between batches.From Zuni Cafe Cookbook by Judy Rodgers (WW Norton \u0026amp Co, £28.99)I used to buy these from Sally Clarke’s shop, Clarkes, on Kensington Church Street in London.

If you think the biscuits may be too hot for you, don’t add the cayenne.Makes about 24 biscuitsunsalted butter 200g, softened, plus extra for greasingself-raising flour 440g caster sugar 150g ground ginger 3 tbsp cayenne pepper a pinch (optional)bicarbonate of soda 1½ tbsp golden syrup 240g (or light corn syrup), warmedtreacle 40g (or molasses), warmedPreheat the oven to 160Cgas mark 3. Butter a baking tray or line it with parchment paper. If you are using a food processor, process the butter with the flour, sugar, ground ginger, cayenne if using, and bicarbonate of soda until they are well mixed. Otherwise, cut the butter into small pieces, mix the dry ingredients together and rub the butter into them with your fingers, and bring together to make a dough. Add the golden syrup and treacle. Break off pieces and shape them into 3cm balls.Place well apart on the prepared tray and bake for about 10 minutes. The biscuits will rise and then fall a little. They must be crisp on the outside and a little chewy on the inside. Cool.From Breakfast, Lunch, Tea: The Many Little Meals of Rose Bakery, by Rose Carrarini (Phaidon Press, £19.95)Yo-yos were a staple of Helen’s Antipodean childhood. As an alternative to custard powder, you could use cornflour. It won’t have the wonderful old-school yellow of custard powder but the yo-yos will still taste great: you might just want to up the amount of vanilla extract you use. And if you’re not opposed to food colouring, a drop or two of yellow will also help to simulate the colour of the custard.The icing can be made up to two days in advance and kept in the fridge. The dough tends to go very hard if left in the fridge, so it is best to roll them on the day the dough is made.Makes 15plain flour 175g, plus 1 tbsp extra for dustingcustard powder 65g (or cornflour)icing sugar 65g salt ⅛ tsp unsalted butter 170g, at room temperature, cubedvanilla extract ¼ tsp (or ½ tsp, if using cornflour)For the rhubarb icingrhubarb 1 small stick (70g), trimmed, washed and cut into roughly 3cm lengths unsalted butter 65g, at room temperature, cubedicing sugar 130g lemon juice ½ tspPreheat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4. Line a small baking tray with baking parchment.To make the rhubarb icing, spread the rhubarb out on the lined baking tray and roast for 30 minutes, or until softened. Remove from the oven and allow to cool before transferring to the bowl of a food processor. Blitz to a puree, then add the butter. Sift in the icing sugar, add the lemon juice and continue to process for a couple of minutes: it seems like a long time, but you want it to thicken, which it will do as it’s whipped. Transfer to a small bowl and chill in the fridge for a couple of hours to firm up. You don’t want the icing to be at all runny, so add a little more icing sugar if necessary: it needs to hold when sandwiched between the biscuits.To make the dough, sift the flour, custard powder, icing sugar and salt into the bowl of an electric mixer with the paddle attachment in place. Mix on a low speed to combine. Add the butter and continue to mix on a low speed until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the vanilla, increase the speed to medium and beat for about 30 seconds, until the dough comes together.Reduce the oven temperature to 170Cgas mark 3. Line two baking trays with parchment paper.Pinch off small bits of dough and use your hands to roll them into 3cm round balls: you should have enough dough for 30 balls, about 15g each. Place them on the lined baking trays, spaced about 4cm apart. Dip the back prongs of a small fork in the remaining flour before gently but firmly pressing down into the middle of each biscuit: the balls will increase to about 3.5cm wide, but don’t press all the way to the bottom you just want to create firm lines in the dough rather than force them to spread out.Bake for 25 minutes, rotating the trays halfway through, until the biscuits are dry on the bottom but have not taken on too much colour. They will be relatively fragile when warm but still firm to the touch. Set aside on the trays to cool for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.To assemble, sandwich pairs of biscuits together with the icing, with the “forked” sides facing outwards. You should use about 15g of icing in each biscuit. It will seem like a lot, but trust us – the biscuits can take it.Once assembled, the yo-yos can be kept for up to 5 days in an airtight container, so long as they are not anywhere too warm (in which case the icing will soften).From Sweet by Yotam Ottolenghi and Helen Goh (Ebury Press, £27)At Violet, we use an ice-cream scoop to portion the cookies perfectly, but at home you can use two dessertspoons.Makes 16 large cookiesunsalted butter 250g, softenedlight brown sugar 200g caster sugar 100g vanilla ½ tsp egg yolks 3 plain flour 325g fine sea salt 1¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda ¾ tsp dark chocolate chips 250g, or broken-up bar of your favourite chocolateLine a small baking tray or baking tin (one that will fit inside your freezer) with parchment paper.Beat the butter and sugars in the bowl of an electric mixer until combined but not too creamy – you are not aiming for light and fluffy here, as that would make the cookies too cakey. Add the vanilla and the egg yolks and mix well.In another bowl weigh out the flour, salt and bicarbonate of soda and whisk together well. Add this to the butter and egg mixture along with the chocolate, and mix until combined.Scoop inidual portions of cookie dough on to the lined baking tray or tin. If using spoons, pat each portion into a little ball. Cover with clingfilm and freeze for at least 1 hour, or up to a month. If you are pushed for time, or simply impatient, you can bake them straightaway, but the cookies will be slightly flatter and less even than the ones here.When ready to bake, preheat your oven to 180Cgas mark 4. Line a large baking tray or tin with parchment paper and arrange the cookies evenly on the tray, leaving enough space between each one so they have room to expand during baking (when they will almost double in size). If you are baking from frozen, allow the cookies 5-10 minutes out of the freezer before placing in the oven.Bake for 18 minutes, until the centre of each cookie is slightly soft and underbaked but the edges are crispy and golden. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the tray for 10 minutes before serving.These cookies will keep for up to 5 days in an airtight container.From The Violet Bakery Cookbook by Claire Ptak (Square Peg, £20)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8d830b806f6ef65c3dd37d81c6a6bb21eeaf67f/0_3377_5683_3410/master/5683.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=912b8f01096befdb128e8f698daca8c6","title":"thomasina miers breaded sardines apple kohlrabi salad recipe","story":"Make the most of this season’s apples with this simple light lunch or supperIn September, I ate my first ribston pippin – the most delicious apple variety I have tasted in a long time.

When they won the Premier League he wrote: ‘Our spirit exists because of the love we share for each other’It is almost eight years to the day since the Football League confirmed that Leicester City’s takeover by a Thailand‑based consortium had been approved. Milan Mandaric, the club’s previous owner, who stayed on as chairman initially, announced: “Today is a great day for Leicester City. Our owners are fantastic people with incredible ambition for the future. They have great character and integrity and they will strive for success for Leicester City.”Few could have imagined how prophetic those words would turn out to be as Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, a Thai billionaire, bought Leicester for £39m and oversaw a magical story of sporting triumph against the odds that rejuvenated a city, never mind a football club, and captured the imagination of people all over the world.That is Vichai’s legacy and will live on in the hearts and minds of the staff, players and supporters at a football club numb with pain and still trying to digest the tragic chain of events at around 8.20pm on Saturday, when a helicopter carrying Leicester’s owner and four other people crashed outside the stadium.Little more than an hour earlier Vichai had been doing one of the things he enjoyed most: watching Leicester play. The 60‑year‑old was never one to say much publicly but actions spoke louder than words from a benefactor who invested heavily in Leicester and regularly attended matches, often flanked in the directors’ box by his son, Aiyawatt, the club’s vice-chairman.A humble and modest man, Vichai left the day-to-day running of the club in the hands of others, notably Susan Whelan, the chief executive, and Jon Rudkin, the director of football, both of whom had his complete trust and would consult with him and Aiyawatt over key decisions.Occasionally Vichai was required to resolve an issue himself and it is a measure of how highly he was regarded that in those circumstances everything tended to get sorted out with the minimum of fuss. Jamie Vardy’s new contract in the title‑winning season was a case in point. Vichai asked Vardy to see him at his private function room at the stadium – where Vardy had never before set foot – after negotiations between the player’s agent and the club had reached an impasse. The striker accepted the club’s financial position, listened to how much Vichai thought of him and walked out of their meeting more than happy to put pen to paper.Vichai had that sort of effect on people and his close relationship with a number of the Leicester players – Vardy even invited him to his wedding – made him much more than a football club owner to them. He would take the squad on an all-expenses-paid night out from time to time and his generosity – something that near enough everyone who has spent time in Vichai’s company talks about – was always appreciated.The kind gestures, whether donating millions of pounds to local charities, handing out 60 free season tickets to fans to mark his 60th birthday or giving every Leicester player a BMW after winning the Premier League title, were never made with publicity in mind.Vichai preferred to stay out of the limelight and was a private man. Even when Leicester’s title‑winning fairytale was unfolding and everyone wanted a piece of the club, he stayed quiet. Yet behind the public silence was a deep love for Leicester and a relentless determination to drive the club on, whether through breaking transfer records for players or pledging £100m towards the cost of a new state-of-the-art training ground.Any interviews with the media were generally left to Aiyawatt, the notable exception being a rare press conference in May 2014, when Leicester had just won promotion from the Championship. Speaking to reporters in Bangkok, Vichai said he wanted a top-five finish in the Premier League within three years and that he was willing to spend £180m to get there.It was bullish talk and, on the face of it, easy to dismiss as unrealistic, especially as Leicester had been out of the top flight for a decade. Yet just under two years after making those comments, Vichai and his son were at Stamford Bridge watching Chelsea hold Tottenham Hotspur to the 2-2 draw that saw Claudio Ranieri’s Leicester side crowned Premier League champions.The party was going on elsewhere, at Vardy’s house in Melton Mowbray, but Vichai and his family would get to enjoy a special moment of their own five days later, when Leicester were presented with the Premier League trophy after the home fixture against Everton.It was notable at the time that Vichai was the prominent figure on the cover of the souvenir programme that day and a few eyebrows were also raised after the game, when the owner and his son seemed to be permanently attached to the Premier League trophy during a lap of honour. Maybe, though, that was nothing more than their immense pride shining through – and quite frankly, who can blame them?Those images will be shown over and again in the days to come and, with one eye on the future, Vichai’s words on that May afternoon are also worth revisiting after a truly awful weekend.“Our spirit exists because of the love we share for each other and the energy it helps to create, both on and off the pitch,” he wrote. “And in the years to come it will continue to be our greatest asset.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/069725eb60696a7ade7c597d1885f93e8ada8979/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef9cec4febf6914499fee2ffb75eadc3","title":"premier league talking points from the weekend action","story":"Klopp, Coleman and people of Liverpool dig deep for Sean Cox, Walcott needs to grow up and Watford enjoy belated SuccessThis is not about the game but something more important and giving credit where it is due. At Anfield on Saturday volunteers from Liverpool FC and Spirit of Shankly supporters’ union held a bucket collection to raise money for Sean Cox, the 53-year-old Liverpool fan who sustained life-altering injuries after being attacked before the Champions League semi-final against Roma in April. The father of three is undergoing rehabilitation in Dún Laoghaire but this will take many years and require significant funding. The fundraising appeal has attracted generous donations from Jürgen Klopp, Everton’s Séamus Coleman and the former Liverpool managing director Christian Purslow – plus many anonymous donors – and contributions from match‑goers on Saturday. Liverpool have pledged their official charity, LFC Foundation, will match all money raised by the bucket collection on Saturday. A fundraising page for Sean Cox’s care can be found at ie.gofundmeSupportSeanCox. Andy HunterWhen Roberto Martínez managed Ross Barkley at Everton, the Spaniard dubbed his force of midfield nature “an amalgam of Paul Gascoigne and Michael Ballack”. A combination of injury and loss of form led to this special talent losing his place with both Everton and England. He had not exactly fallen off the edge of the world but when Barkley joined Chelsea for £15m last January it seemed a gamble. Now it looks a bargain. Those who, in August, wondered where Barkley would fit into an apparently overstocked Chelsea midfield cannot argue he is not worthy of a starting place. At Burnley he scored a beautiful goal, created another for Willian and denied Sean Dyche’s side a goal. Like Wayne Rooney and Jonjo Shelvey, Barkley still has something of the street footballer about him. How wonderful to see his improvisational talent thriving once more. Louise TaylorCrystal Palace have looked more like their former selves in the past week. Admittedly, their efforts at Everton and at home against Arsenal have yielded a solitary point, and the forthcoming matches against Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United are still distinctly daunting. But this team appear to have rediscovered some of their more abrasive qualities after a low-key, rather slack start to the campaign. Wilfried Zaha looked fit and far more of a livewire against Arsenal. There is energy to their midfield and from full-back, and aggression at centre‑half. Luka Milivojevic, off colour up to now, has his first goals of the campaign. Roy Hodgson’s substitutions were decisive, with Max Meyer influential in his cameo and even Alexander Sørloth looking more the part. Most importantly, a run of defeats has been checked. Those games to come against the elite still feel treacherous, but the qualities which thrust Palace into mid-table in the run-in last season clearly remain. Dominic FifieldMesut Özil’s most dynamic involvement at Selhurst Park was when he dragged himself off the pitch after the assistant referee showed his number in red lights in the 68th minute. When he got a yard beyond Unai Emery, he took off his gloves and threw them to the floor, showing his frustration for an absent performance. The German midfielder was the Arsenal captain once again but influenced neither the play nor the spirit of his team with a meek outing. In tight games, when the opposition are offering little space to operate in, it is Özil’s role to find the gaps and change the dynamic but instead he operated on the periphery waiting for the game to come to him rather than the other way round, as Arsenal relied on two set-pieces to earn a barely deserved point. Will Unwin• The Dozen: the weekend’s best Premier League photosThis was not the plan when Fulham spent north of £100m in the summer. One victory, two draws and seven defeats have left them in the bottom three, with whispers (publicly scotched by the owner, Shahid Khan) that Slavisa Jokanovic’s job is under threat. Perhaps the most worrying thing is the sense of chaos around team selection. Jokanovic has used 22 players including three goalkeepers, made 25 starting XI changes and used at least four formations. “Slav Bingo” has become a popular pre‑lineup announcement game, and the inconsistency in selection is probably the main reason why they have failed to recreate the attacking football that got them promoted. It is not all his fault, but Jokanovic is at least realistic about his prospects. “The owner didn’t bring me here because I am a good lad,” he said on Saturday. “He brought me here to win games. This is my challenge, and I’m up for that.” Nick MillerThe difference between Brighton and most of the teams below them is they can win without playing to their best thanks to their defensive fortitude. Shane Duffy and Lewis Dunk can be spectacular in the way they repel opponents, and the goalkeeper Mat Ryan is excellent. Those were the three outstanding performers on Saturday, keeping out a mostly dominant Wolves team so that Glenn Murray’s goal was enough to secure a victory. It was a third consecutive clean sheet and win for Chris Hughton’s men but the manager does not want to keep relying excessively on his defenders. “To see the performance against Wolves and last week, they are not bad performances but you can only have so many of them,” he said. “The law of averages says that if a team have more shots, more crosses, then the balance will go in their favour. So we need to up our game.” Paul DoyleTheo Walcott always seems a very likeable man, but he is an infuriating footballer. Twice at Old Trafford, he broke into the right-hand side of the box with Richarlison inside him. On both occasions, to the Brazilian’s fury, he chose to take on a shot rather than square the ball. His first shot was weak his second beaten away comfortably by David de Gea. And that wasn’t even his most negative contribution. Both United goals came from him losing possession and, for the second, he barely raised a run to track back, which left Anthony Martial in space to receive Paul Pogba’s pass and score. For a player so experienced – he may seem locked in a bubble of eternal potential, but Walcott is 29 now – to be guilty of such a dereliction was staggering. At some point, the Peter Pan of English football needs to grow up and start taking responsibility. Jonathan Wilson• Match report: Manchester United 2-1 Everton• Silva accuses Martial of ing for penaltyPerhaps it was because little happened in this match, but neither manager seemed fussed by the result. Mark Hughes shrugged off a smattering of missed chances, reflecting that his team had done enough to win. Rafael Benítez was pleased enough with the visitors’ defending, and hoped a point might prove a stepping stone. There may, however, have been another explanation for the prevailing calm. After 10 matches, Southampton and Newcastle may have 10 points between them, but they’re hardly the only ones struggling. In total, the bottom six have conjured up 30 points, easily the lowest total of recent seasons. This time last year, the cumulative figure was 46. In 2016 it was 43, in 2015 44, and in 2014 it was 50. The implication being: a lower points total might be enough to stay up. So not quite time to panic just yet then. Paul MacInnesIt is more than two years since Watford signed Isaac Success from Granada for a then club-record fee of around £12.5m. He remains the second most expensive player in thesquad but in his subsequent obscurity his fee has been forgotten. In his first season he started two league games, nearly six months apart. Last season he spent six games on the bench and no minutes on the pitch before joining Málaga on loan in January, where he failed to score. He has now started consecutive league games, both of them won, and while his passing on Saturday was not always perfect he demonstrated plenty of quality and also, importantly, fitness, before scoring his first Premier League goal in 25 months. “I realised just before the start of this season that talent was not enough, and hard work will always beat talent,” said the Nigerian. “I think I have now become a better person, I have become a better professional and that helped my career a lot.” Simon Burnton"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26f1947ff959b8c02e597d3b83a81d9be3e59583/0_216_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4490829817637e19e6763c37847d2d00","title":"thai sporting and political leaders pay tribute to leicester city owner vichai srivaddhanaprabha","story":"As Thailand woke on Monday morning to the confirmation that Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, the reclusive but beloved billionaire owner of King Power retail and Leicester City football club, had been among the five who died in the helicopter crash outside the stadium, the tributes began pouring in.Figures in the world of Thai politics, football and even the royal family spoke of a “warm” and “generous” man, who had brought national pride to Thailand in his role as a businessman and as Leicester City chairman.Nualphan Lamsam, who manages Thailand’s national women’s football team, sent “thoughts and prayers” to Vichai’s family, while Anutin Charnvirakul, leader of the Bhumjai Thai political party, told local media that he considered Vichai to be like a “big brother”“He is a self-made man, worked hard and loved friends dearly,” he said. “We just lost someone who made big contributions to the public. I am sure his legacy will live on.”Little was known about Vichai, owner of the King Power duty free retail empire, who opened his first shop in 1989 and by 2006 had been given a multi dollar monopoly over the main Thai airports. Much of his success was credited to his ability to weather Thailand’s turbulent political environment, a rare ally of both former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who now lives in exile, and the current ruling military junta.However, it was his purchase of Leicester City in 2010 that pushed Vichai into the public eye. Thailand, a football-loving nation, became as swept up in the club’s remarkable ascendence to Premier League triumph as fans in the UK and prompted swathes of Thais switched their allegiances from the popular clubs Manchester United and Liverpool to become proud Leicester supporters.While he mainly shied from the limelight even in his home country, Vichai was particularly respected among Thais for speaking publicly about how “Thai values and Thai culture” were at the heart of how he ran Leicester City.After their triumphant league win in 2016, Vichai brought the team back to Thailand to show off their trophy to crowds of thousands who gathered in the streets of Bangkok. Chatworachet Sae-Kow, a Leicester City fan in Bangkok, explained how much the success of the club under Vichai’s leadership meant to the country.Kawin Thamsatchanan, goalkeeper for the Thai national team who plays for Oud-Heverlee Leuven- the Belgium football club also owned by Vichai- paid a lengthy and personal tribute to the King Power magnate, speaking of the impact he had on his life and thanking him for the opportunity to live out his dream and play football in Europe.“I could feel your commitment and dedication to what you do, and the warmth and love you had for me,” said Thamsatchanan. “Thank you for the opportunity and confidence in me.”Vichai’s connections to the upper echelons of Thai society were also demonstrated by the personal condolences offered by Thai royal family member, Princess Ubolratana Rajajanya Sirivadhana Bavardi, who said Vichai’s death was a “great loss to the football world”. The eldest daughter of the now exiled former Thai prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra - who had been an ally and champion of Vichai’s- also spoke of her disbelief.The Football Association of Thailand released a statement expressing their “profound sadness” at the “sudden and tragic passing” of Vichai. Following the news of the crash on Sunday, the head of the FA Thailand, Somyot Poompanmoung, who was extremely close to Vichai, travelled to the UK.Four other passengers who died in the crash were named by Leicestershire police as Nursara Suknamai and Kaveporn Punpare, both members of Vichai’s staff, pilot Eric Swaffer and passenger Izabela Roza Lechowicz."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfcce75551f8a6c9384ef99650d82c47e496019c/0_183_2742_1645/master/2742.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e44cdbb60f6a5fb5e1cc4915d78054e","title":"wembley pitch spurs manchester city tottenham nfl american football","story":"Premier League match kicks off 30 hours after NFL game and Wembley can call no time outs in bid to have perfect surfaceIf Wembley’s ground staff are feeling sorry for themselves at the prospect of turning a pitch prepared for the NFL match between Jacksonville Jaguars and Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday into a surface perfect for the Premier League match between Tottenham and Manchester City on Monday night in less than a day, they can seek some solace in the fact that some of their predecessors had it very much worse.The Spurs game will kick off 30.5 hours after the NFL match, but in 1991 Wembley had to cope with a game between the London Monarchs and Orlando Thunder that started at 8pm on a Saturday night, with Crystal Palace playing Everton in the Full Members’ Cup final, then known as the Zenith Data Systems Cup, only 19 hours later on Sunday afternoon.“The Monarchs game finished about 10pm, and we worked right the way through till 1pm on Sunday,” says Steve Tingley, then Wembley’s head groundsman. “By the time we got rid of all the lines and numbers it was about 4am before we could get a mower out there, and mow it in a football pattern.”This is not the only problem the current groundstaff will encounter as they attempt to give Wembley a 24-hour transformation. Like many Premier League teams the pitch is strengthened with a Desso system, which knits the grass with polypropylene fibres. This makes it much less likely to cut up, but also reduces options when there is wear.“We had a normal playing surface based on sand and soil and it would ot,” says Tingley. “American football was an awful sport to play on our pitch because it used to cut up so bad. Obviously in American football they make a play, go back to the same place, make another play and go back to the same place, and it’s all through the middle of the field. So the centre of your field gets absolutely trashed.“These days they have Desso which stops it from doing that. They’re far luckier than we were. We spent hours that night just putting ots back. But in my opinion Desso isn’t perfect for Wembley, because it doesn’t allow you to right the wrongs of American football, concerts and whatever else. It’s very hard to recreate the playing surface between games. Some other products allow you to take worn areas away and replace them with perfect turf again.“In 1992 we had seven or eight Monarchs games, and it absolutely destroyed the centre of the pitch. So we commissioned a company to make a machine that would cut turf in one-metre-squared sections, two inches thick, so we could swap them out. In the week leading up to the FA Cup final we replaced the entire centre of the pitch, and nobody could have noticed there had been American football on.“I did enjoy the challenge, and I’m sure the guys at Wembley will be in a similar mode now. One time the stadium manager came to me and asked if we could do rugby league on a Saturday and football on a Sunday, and we did it. And then I realised what we’d done: we’d opened the door for them to do more. Then the Monarchs came along, or the Nelson Mandela tribute concert three weeks before a Cup final. You do things you’ve never done before.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dceff5a99da4f63b8d881adb13c5bab28742defb/205_412_2647_1588/master/2647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f43ee73ef8d5ff47a434c1413486246","title":"five scenic uk cycle routes for beginners","story":"Cycling doesn’t have to be all about endurance, speed and derring-do – it’s also an activity that can be relaxing and even meditative. These five routes are perfect for those looking to take on longer rides at a gentler paceMore and more people are rediscovering cycling as a gentle way to exercise and explore new places on their own steam. Cycling lets us experience our surroundings in new ways – from the sights and smells we might miss in the car, to the simple pleasure of feeling the wind in our hair. It’s also something just about anyone can enjoy: cycling is non-weight bearing, and for many people it’s easier than walking. There are also bikes to suit most needs. With some great, flat, traffic-free or low-traffic routes across the UK that you can enjoy at a gentle pace, inspiration and adventure are just around the corner.Distance: 18 milesStart: PadstowEnd: Wenford BridgeTime taken to cycle: one-and-a-half to two hours without stopsThe Camel Trail is one of the UK’s best-loved cycle trails, not least with families, for its beautiful waterside scenery and wealth of wildlife. From picturesque Padstow it follows the Camel estuary’s shore, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and home to little egrets, peregrines, ospreys and kingfishers. The delightful riveted Little Petherick creek bridge once served the former railway line. After an on-road section through Wadebridge it wends through wooded country beside the River Camel, past Bodmin, before briefly skirting Bodmin Moor, to Wenford Bridge.Pit stopTreats on Trikes is a traditional tea, cake and ice cream vendor on a tricycle, midway between Padstow and Wadebridge, at Penquean quarry.Distance: 13 milesStart: Sirhowy valley country parkEnd: Taff Bargoed parkTime to cycle: one to one-and-a-half hours without stopsExplore three south Wales valleys parks by bike. Starting at Sirhowy valley country park, north-west of Newport, you’ll follow a former railway line over the listed Hengoed viaduct, with its 16 towering arches, and past the Wheel o Drams, an 8-metre tall circular sculpture of mining carts. Penallta country park once housed the deepest pit in the south Wales coalfields, and now features viewpoints, wetlands, and the UK’s largest earth sculpture – Sultan the Pit Pony (above, top left). You’ll finish in Taff Bargoed park, once three pits, and now a wildlife haven perfect for a riverside picnic. There are train stations at Crosskeys, Hengoed and Quakers Yard.Pit stopsLord Nelson Inn, Commercial St, Nelson, Treharris. Cafe on the Rock, the Old Drift Mine, Trelewis, Treharris.Distance: 10.6 miles Start: Aberdeen station End: DrumoakTime to cycle: one to one-and-a-half hours, at a leisurely paceThe Deeside Way in its entirety follows a former railway line from Aberdeen to Ballater, of which this is a 10-mile, largely traffic-free section. Start at the Polmuir Road entrance of Aberdeen’s Duthie park, behind the Winter Gardens. One of the largest indoor gardens in Europe, it is well worth a visit, with rare plants from around the world, and the tantalising “corridor of perfumes”.Follow the leafy path past homes and parkland, and under tree canopies towards Peterculter. You’ll join a quiet country road at Coalford keep on the path until you reach an access road leading to Drumoak. There are three former stations en route, as well as the Peterculter Heritage Centre and, a short distance from the Deeside Way at Drumoak, the 13th-century Drum Castle. At Drumoak, you can catch a bus back to Aberdeen with the bikes.Pit stops Duthie Park Cafe, 25 Polmuir Gardens, Aberdeen.Newton Dee Cafe, at Newton Dee Village, Bieldside. The Bieldside Inn, 37 North Deeside Road, Bieldside.Distance: 8.5 milesStart: Blackwell MillEnd: BakewellTime taken to cycle: around one hour without stopsLike most great traffic-free cycling routes in the UK, the Monsal Trail started life as a railway line. The popular route, in the heart of the Peak District, is steeped in geological, industrial and rail heritage. There are six rail tunnels, four of which are around 400-metres long and lit during the day, as well as excellent views from Monsal, Headstone and Miller’s viaducts. From Blackwell Mill, just south of Buxton, head east through enchanting Chee Dale, in the Upper Wye valley. The lime kilns at Millers Dale station are imposing, fortress-like structures, cut into the rock face.Pit stop Hassop Station Cafe is in an old station building on the trail, complete with sun terrace. It’s open year-round, serving tea, cakes and ice-cream.Distance: 16 miles one-way (32-mile return)Start: CowesEnd: SandownTime to cycle: one-and-a-half hours without stops three-four hours returnNearly half of the Isle of Wight is a designated Area of Outstanding Beauty, and it’s one of the few places in England with red squirrels. The Red Squirrel route links two traffic-free trails, and the compact island’s north and east coasts, with some on-road sections running through towns. Starting at Cowes, it traces the Medina River to Blackwater, before wending through peaceful countryside, following the River Yar to Sandown. En route are Osborne House (above left), Queen Victoria and Albert’s former holiday home, Cowes Maritime Museum, the Museum of Island History in Newport, Carisbrooke Castle and Dinosaur Isle, in Sandown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dd11e7b1b7463c2b603bc491b63d881667aa44a/171_113_2379_1428/master/2379.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5054ccf5f24480f05ef341d5cb3921d","title":"no time for the gym then try hiit the workout you can do anywhere","story":"High-intensity interval training (HIIT) can be done in a matter of minutes and delivers fitness in dense, bite-size chunks of exercise throughout the day. No wonder the fitness world loves itIf you have an injury or health condition, consult your doctor before doing these exercisesIt doesn’t take much time to improve your health. HIIT has become a staple in the fitness world and for good reason: it’s the time-efficient, super-effective way to get fitter that’s backed by science.But it doesn’t always have to mean donning your lycra – in fact, research shows that as little as a minute of HIIT can benefit the body. The workouts below take two minutes each, one for each hour of your working day. They target every muscle group in the body, require no equipment and can be done in very little space.The benefits? You’ll boost your circulation and energy levels every hour, so no more wanting to sleep face down on your keyboard it will increase your cardio fitness, muscle strength and core stability, and you’ll continue to burn calories even after you’re back at your desk!Before doing each workout, warm up by gently jogging on the spot for 30 seconds and then standing and raising one knee at a time in front of you – 10 on each leg. Work as hard as you can for the 20-second bursts of exercise. At the end of the workout, pace around for 30 seconds to cool down and stretch out any muscles that feel tight.Each workout follows the same pattern: do the first three exercises for 20 seconds each, with 10 seconds of rest in between each one. Do the fourth exercise for 30 seconds:Plank Lie on your front, hands beneath your shoulders, elbows pointing back. Tuck your toes under and push yourself up until your arms are straight, pulling your navel up towards your spine so you feel the core stability muscles around your middle engage. Keep looking at the floor and make sure your bottom is neither sagging towards the floor nor pushing up towards the ceiling.Press-ups From a plank position, bend your elbows to lower yourself towards the floor. Letting your elbows flare out to the side works the chest harder keeping them nearer your sides focuses more on the triceps. A full-press up is touching your nose almost to the ground, but you may not get that far to start with. The most important thing is to keep a straight line from your knees, to hips, to head. Balance on your knees rather than your feet to make it easier if needed.Jumping jacksStand with feet together and hands by your sides. Simultaneously, jump your feet out sideways and swing your arms out to the side and up until your fingertips meet above your head. Jump back to starting position.Bottom kicksJog on the spot, flicking your heels up to kick your bottom.High kneesJog on the spot while bringing your knees up high in front of you. Use your arms to really drive the movement and go as fast as you can. If this is too vigorous for you, do the same action but as though you’re walking rather than running.Mountain climbersFrom a plank position, lift your right foot off the floor and drive the knee towards your chest. Place the foot back and repeat with your left knee. Don’t stick your bottom high in the air and keep a rapid flow.Shadow boxStand with feet hip-width apart and bring fists up into a boxing position. Punch upwards with the right hand then the left, then punch across your body with your right hand then left, allowing your body to rotate towards the direction of the punch and heel to come off the floor.Bear crawlKneel on all fours, hands directly under your shoulders, knees under your hips. Tuck your toes under and lift your knees to hover a few inches above the ground. Now crawl forwards – right arm at same time as left leg and vice versa – for six paces, then crawl backwards for six. Keep your abdominals engaged and back as flat as possible (imagine you’re balancing something on it).Reverse lungesStand with feet hip-width apart. Step back with your left foot, lowering the front knee to a right angle or deeper. Focus on using the glute in your right buttock to power back up to standing. Repeat with the right leg.Sumo squatsStand with feet wide apart, toes turned slightly out (about 45-degree angle), hands clasped in front of your chest. Keeping your back straight, bend your knees in the direction of your toes (but don’t go beyond them) to lower yourself until your knees are as near to 90 degrees as possible. Keep your weight in your heels. Come back to standing.Squats or jump squatsStand with feet just wider than hip-width apart. Cross your arms and place your hands on opposite shoulders. Keeping your torso upright and chest facing forward, bend your knees and stick your bottom out, spread your weight through your heels and ensure that your knees don’t stick out beyond the end of your toes. For a full squat, you’re aiming to lower your bottom to knee height while keeping your chest facing forward, but go as far as is comfortable. Return to standing. To make squats harder, add in a little jump at the top of the move.Bicycle crunchesLie on your back with feet flat on the floor, hands touching your ears, elbows out to the side. Simultaneously, lift your feet and head off the floor and begin to slowly move your legs in a pedalling motion. As your right knee comes towards you, bring your left elbow towards it and vice versa with the left knee and right elbow. Keep your torso still by engaging your core stability muscles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46bde53bfab45f752f0423461a10de1c7b166975/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93f40f06a7976a63d80404621f00899d","title":"nine simple ways to revamp your workspace for a healthier environment","story":"Improving your posture at work, adding some greenery to your desk and moving to a window seat are just some of the quick fixes that can transform your productivityThere’s a lot more to happiness in the workplace than a comfortable salary. In fact, working more than 40 hours a week may well be doing you a considerable disservice and directly affecting your health and performance at work. Thankfully, taking a few minutes of your day and deploying intelligent fixes can turn your office from a dreary workspace to an area that transforms your productivity and mindset. Here are nine ways you can make your office work for you.Take a standThere’s a reason standing desks – no longer the reserve of agile Silicon Roundabout startups – are quickly making their way into the offices of multinationals. Encouraging employees to be considerably more aware of their posture at work, adjustable desks and workstations such as Varidesk and the Yo-Yo desk are quickly becoming adopted by offices across the UK. What’s more, sitting for more than six hours a day leaves you at greater risk of anxiety and depression, according to the Association for Psychological Science – meaning that an eight-hour day spent on your rear quickly becomes an unhealthy habit.Spring cleaningOld meeting notes, dirty mugs, empty sandwich boxes and a dirty keyboard all add up to an unhappy desk. According to a study by Princeton Neuroscience Institute, “multiple visual stimuli” – also known as unwelcome desk clutter – compete for attention in your brain, meaning you can remove distraction with a desk free of unnecessary mess. Similarly, you’ll want to give your keyboard a wipe-down every week or so, as the average keyboard has 20,000 times more bacteria than a toilet seat.Stretch it outStressful experiences – at work and at home – have the potential to age the human brain by four years, according to a 2017 study presented at the Alzheimer’s Association’s conference. Thankfully, you can de-stress and fight poor posture at your desk by working through this stretching routine. To open up your back, bring your hands behind you and press your palms together. Bring your elbows back and downwards, slowly tucking your chin – hold the stretch for 30 seconds and repeat three times. Consider this your first step to become a more supple – and pain-free – human.Make a moveFor now, there are no stringent laws on taking screen breaks, but the Health and Safety Executive recommends a five- to 10-minute break every hour. Standing up and walking around will help stretch your body, adjust your posture and increase productivity and attention, as well as the quality of your work.Give yourself a handSpending 35-plus hours at a desk each week is hardly appealing, the very real prospect of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) – a condition in which a nerve in your wrist is under pressure, causing numb hands, weakness and tingling – is far worse. Common in men and women over 40 years old, CTS stems from repetitive actions such as using a mouse and keyboard. Handily, ergonomic office equipment – Microsoft Surface and Mac-friendly Kinesis Freestyle are two of the UK’s most popular options – can help stave CTS off. The oddly shaped equipment improves forearm posture, adds comfort and supports your hands. You’ll agree that it’ll be worth a few odd looks.Thirsty workWorkplace absence in the UK is costing £18bn annually, according to analysis from Centre of Economic and Business Research. That’s a total of 168m working days lost annually. While there’s no sole reason for this, it’s important to adopt everyday habits to keep you as healthy as possible in the workplace. Dehydration, for example, even at a mild level, directly affects both physical and mental performance, meaning that you’ll find it hard to concentrate during work hours and struggle with that post-work run. Women should aim for two litres a day, and men for three litres.Light workIf constantly feeling tired is making office life a miserable reality, it could be because of the light levels in your office. A 2013 study from the Netherlands found that when office workers were exposed to more daylight during the working week, they were less sleepy and considerably more energetic. Similarly, researchers from Turkey found that study participants who had three hours or more of daylight a day felt considerably happier and more satisfied – muting the chance of office burnout. Push for that window desk and reap the rewards immediately.Pain in the neckYour career, rather unfortunately, is wreaking havoc on your neck. A combination of poor posture and stress, which affects your sleep, is likely to be causing unnecessary neck pain. Rarely a sign of something more serious, neck pain can be treated with over-the-counter painkillers such as Voltarol, which can be taken orally or applied directly to the affected area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8edc98c00ef1f77ebd73c6987ba10c13e222769c/0_203_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2e49b470dba5d46f6128b6e5361f15b","title":"alkaline water cure bs science beyonce tom brady","story":"Beyonce and Tom Brady swear by it – but experts throw cold water on the new beverage fadMy friend Kate has become very basic lately. She seems to have a bottle of alkaline water with her at all times and, the way she goes on about it, you’d think it was the elixir of life. It has improved her skin! Upped her focus! Tastes great! Someone bought her a bottle of the stuff when she was hungover (it’s brilliant for hangovers!) and she’s been a convert ever since.She’s not the only one. Alkaline water, which is water that has been treated to have a higher pH level than the 6.5-7.5 pH range of most tap and bottled water, is experiencing a surge of popularity. Beyonce helped kickstart the trend in 2013 when reports surfaced that she included alkaline water on a rider for her Mrs Carter Show world tour. Tom Brady is another celebrity who has professed his love for the stuff. According to data from the Beverage Marketing Corporation, a research and consultancy group, the alkaline water market has grown from being a $47m business in 2014 to a $427m business in 2017. It’s projected to be worth $687m by the end of 2018.There are a variety of alkaline water brands on the market including Core, Essentia, and Alkaline88. Essentia has a pH of 9.5, achieved after putting regular water through an ionizing process that removes acidic components. This, the company claims, results in “better hydration”. Alkaline88 meanwhile, has a pH of 8.8 “designed to obtain optimum body balance”.Why would drinking water with a higher pH level be better for you? Dr Tanis Fenton, an adjunct professor at the University of Calgary and an evidence analyst for Dietitians of Canada, told me that the marketing claims behind alkaline water are based on an old idea called the acid-ash hypothesis. This posits that eating certain food like meat, dairy and eggs results in something called acid ash in your body, which increases your acid levels and causes adverse health effects including osteoporosis.In 2002 an alternative medicine practitioner called Robert O Young spun the acid-ash hypothesis into a fad alkaline diet, with a popular series of books called the pH Miracle. According to these books, an alkaline diet could treat all manner of woes, from poor digestion to cancer. Young, by the way, was sentenced to three years in jail in 2017 for practicing medicine without a license.While people have been touting the benefits of upping your alkaline levels for decades, Fenton says the belief is not supported by any scientific evidence. Fenton, who analyzed studies looking at the association of alkaline water with cancer treatment, notes that while “there are a few very poorly designed studies” that suggest alkaline water confers health benefits, there is no rigorous evidence this is the case.While you can’t change the pH of your blood, your diet does affect the pH of your urine. “Most people’s urine is about 6, which is acidic,” she explains. However, “that’s no problem, that shows our kidneys is working.” So while it’s possible drinking alkaline water may make your urine less acidic, that doesn’t really make a difference you’re literally just flushing money down the drain. Ultimately, says Fenton, alkaline water is a solution to a problem that doesn’t need solving.As well as riding the wellness wave, alkaline water is also part of a “rising connoisseurship around water”, says Lucie Greene, the worldwide director of a trends and consumer behavior group at advertising agency J Walter Thompson. Bottled water recently became the number one drink in the US for the first time in history, overtaking soda, which is declining in popularity.“We’re seeing multiple trends and selling points within water at the moment,” Greene explained over email. “From ‘raw’ water (literally water from the ground) which was popularized by Silicon Valley Burning Man advocates, to water with electrolytes. There are now halal mineral waters. And waters that have been doctored to have special properties and benefits, like Oxigen, the oxygenated water brand that claims to boost the benefits of water by harnessing O4, a proprietary molecule that delivers a concentrated dose of oxygen.”Greene also notes that Instagram has radically “accelerated the pace of food, drink and health trends”. We’re seeing things move “from fringe to global trend at a much faster rate than before”. Brands like Essentia have capitalized on this with influencer marketing and paid social media placements.If alkaline water is just a fad with no scientific basis, however, what about people like my friend Kate, who swear they feel its benefits?Well, says Dr Fenton, it’s possible that they’re drinking more water than they were before, which is not a bad thing. Also, she says, “have you heard of the placebo effect?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83f9d7445b3d7cc8a2c0599baa396ee7c6692612/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e5c5bdb949a73329da6574a3964386f","title":"complete guide to waking up feeling fantastic","story":"Now the clocks have gone back and the days are getting shorter, it can be hard to get out of bed. But, from dawn simulators to a regular wakeup time, here are 16 ways to start the day wellThere is nothing wrong with using your phone alarm – unless its other functions are interfering with your sleep. Several studies have indicated that greater phone use, particularly in the run-up to bedtime, results in worse quality sleep. The main reason is the light from screens altering the timing of the brain’s master clock, a cluster of cells that dictates the timing of all the other biological clocks in the body. Exposure to bright or blue-enriched light at night shifts its timing later, which means we feel tired later and our bodies are still in sleep mode when it is time to get up in the morning. Light also has a direct alerting effect on the brain, which makes it harder to fall asleep.If you do sleep with your phone, set it to night mode to filter out blue light and adjust the brightness setting to dim. Nick Littlehales, an elite sports sleep coach and the author of the book Sleep, says you should also switch it to silent and rest it on a soft surface to dampen any vibrations from incoming alerts.In an ideal world, we wouldn’t need alarm clocks we would simply go to bed when we felt tired and sleep until we were ready to wake up. However, the ubiquity of artificial light after dusk means that relying on when we feel sleepy to dictate our bedtimes isn’t very helpful. Our natural sleep rhythm has shifted later, yet most of us must wake up at a prescribed time to go to work or school, meaning our sleep is cut short. It also means that we often wake up when our bodies think it is still night-time, which increases feelings of “sleep inertia” – the grogginess you experience immediately upon waking. US researchers showed that when people were sent on a camping trip and denied access to their electronic gadgets, their circadian rhythms shifted about two hours earlier, which meant they felt sleepier earlier and got more sleep.That depends on your chronotype – your natural sleep-timing preference – which is hardwired in your genes. “It is not a choice and it is very difficult to change,” says Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of Why We Sleep. Some people are larks and predisposed to wake up early, others are late types who naturally sleep in most of us lie somewhere in between. However, even night owls can become a little more lark-like if they reduce their exposure to light at night and seek out bright light from the moment they wake up, which pushes the master clock earlier. These innate sleep preferences also vary with age. Teenagers’ sleep timing typically shifts about two hours later, while as we get older, we become progressively more lark-like.More important than when you prefer to get up is consistency in the timing of your sleep. If you go to bed and wake up later at weekends, you are effectively giving yourself jet lag – and when your alarm clock wakes you at 7am on Monday, your body will still think it’s night-time. “The most important advice I can give people who are struggling with sleep, or want to get good-quality sleep, is to keep it regular,” says Walker.Yes, provided you go to sleep at about the same time every night and wake at the same time each morning, says Lisa Artis, an adviser for the Sleep Council. “Your internal body clock will strengthen and you will start to wake naturally at a time that suits you. However, if not setting an alarm is going to make you anxious about sleeping in and missing a train or an important meeting, you should set the alarm,” she adds. “Otherwise, you will spend most of your time in bed worrying you won’t get enough sleep.”Tempting as it may be to set your alarm a bit early so you can enjoy dozing in bed, there are good reasons why this is a bad idea. For one thing, “interrupted sleep is not good-quality sleep”, says Walker. The impact on your heart is another. Although setting an alarm may be necessary – and even a good thing, if it encourages regularity in the timing of your sleep – if you are repeatedly exposed to it, “you are literally alarming your heart”, he says. “Set the alarm for when you need to get up, then turn it off and get up.”Dawn simulators are often marketed as a gentler way to wake up, the idea being that gradual exposure to light may cause gentle stirring, which means we experience less sleep inertia when we wake. There is little direct evidence for this, but several studies have found improvements in people’s subjective alertness after being woken this way. In one such study, Dutch researchers compared people’s responses to being woken by a dawn simulator with a light being switched on at the same time as an alarm going off. “We saw that there was a faster reduction of sleepiness if people had this gradual increase in light prior to waking up,” says Marijke Gordijn at the University of Groningen. A study by Swiss researchers found that dawn simulation left people feeling and performing better all day.Exposure to light during the daytime may also improve the quality of your sleep. In a different study, Gordijn and her colleagues discovered that people who were exposed to more daylight had less fragmented and deeper sleep that night and reported feeling less sleepy the next morning.If you have trouble waking up in the mornings, having some light coming in through the windows may help. On the other hand, particularly in summer when it is light before 5am, this night-time light exposure can result in disturbed sleep. “It really is a balance between having the blinds drawn so one gets good sleep, versus getting light as soon as one wakes up,” says Nayantara Santhi, a circadian biologist at the Surrey sleep research centre at the University of Surrey in Guildford. If you do use blackout blinds or curtains, Santhi suggests opening them as soon as you get out of bed. Another option is to combine blackout blinds with a dawn-simulating clock.If you really need that kind of a motivation to get out of bed, it suggests you’re suffering from chronic sleep deprivation. Walker says: “Most people – as long as they are sleeping in synchrony with their body rhythms and getting sufficient sleep – should be able to wake up for the most part naturally, and require very little nudging. A normal alarm should do it.”Whatever you do, try to avoid turning on the lights. Bright light is a stimulant, like caffeine, so it will make it harder for you to fall back to sleep. And it will shift the timing of your circadian clocks, which could interfere with your sleep the next night – as well as making your other body systems work less efficiently. If a child has woken you and they need soothing, “try to do it in the dark or, if needs be, use a very dim light”, says Artis. Avoid looking at a clock. “Watching the sleepless minutes pass makes it harder to fall back to sleep, so turn the clock face so you can’t see it. And if your mind starts racing, try doing some simple relaxation or breathing exercises in bed,” she adds.A strategic nap in the afternoon is a good strategy. “By taking a nap, you reduce the hours of continuous wakefulness, which is one of the two main processes that contribute to sleepiness, the other being the circadian rhythm,” says Cassie Hilditch, a fatigue countermeasures researcher at the San Jose State University Research Foundation in California. “Napping in the afternoon is recommended over napping in the evening, as the evening tends to be when we are most alert. In the afternoon, however, you can take advantage of the body’s natural dip in alertness, which makes it easier to nap.”Caffeine can also be strategically deployed to boost alertness – but only use as needed, to avoid building up a tolerance to it. And it should be avoided towards the end of the night shift, as “it has a long half-life so could interfere with recovery sleep the next day”, Hilditch adds.“There are lots of claims about how certain bedding and pyjamas can help sleep but, honestly, I don’t think there is sufficient enough evidence to say if they do or don’t, so I would say it’s down to personal preference,” says Artis. You don’t want to be too hot or too cold, because both can affect the quality of your sleep.It can certainly affect how easy it is to fall asleep in the evening – a room temperature of 16C-17C is considered ideal. “Your body temperature needs to drop to initiate and then maintain sleep,” says Walker. This is why bed socks or a hot-water bottle by your feet can help you to fall asleep: they cause the blood vessels in your skin to open up and shed heat.The opposite seems to be true for waking up, however. Body temperature reaches its nadir during the early hours of the morning, then rises progressively throughout the day. Several studies suggest that the reduction in sleepiness we experience after we wake up is mirrored by a transfer of heat from the extremities to the core. There is no research into whether stepping on to a cold floor increases the transition to wakefulness, but there is reason to think it might. “If you lower your skin temperature, it may help to wake you up,” says Gordijn.You don’t want your house to be too cold in the mornings, however, as your body is now trying to raise its temperature. Setting the thermostat to come on shortly before waking may aid this, says Walker it may also help explain why people crave a warm drink in the morning.“There is nothing inherently wrong with needing a good cup of coffee in the morning,” says Artis. “But what you have to ask yourself is: why do you need it to feel awake and alert?” If you are only able to function with a shot of coffee inside you, the chances are you’re not sleeping properly, so you should try and examine why that is. “If you need caffeine to function before 10 or 11 o’clock in the morning, you are probably self-medicating a state of sleep deprivation,” Walker adds.

If that doesn’t work, you can indulge your inner musicianTake a deep breath. No, really, it is that simple. There are a number of breathing exercises you can do that help keep your lungs healthy. One involves standing up with your back arched, breathing in and holding your breath for 10 seconds before exhaling – which can easily be done while watching the telly.A study released this year found that higher vitamin D levels were associated with better lung function. In the summer, depending on where you live, most people can get enough vitamin D from the sunshine. As the winter months approach and the sun disappears, it may be worth investing in vitamin D supplements. Vitamin D can also be found in foods such as oily fish, egg yolks and red meat.If you are one of the many people who enjoy singing in the shower then you may be in luck, because singing can, apparently, aid lung capacity. According to the British Lung Foundation, it’s particularly helpful for patients with respiratory diseases. People with lung conditions told the foundation that controlling their breathing through singing helped manage their conditions. It is an area that is still being investigated. A study of 20 Indonesian students, published in 2015, found that the average lung capacity of choir singers was higher than that of non-singers.One reason people want to increase their lung capacity is improve their sports performance. Helpfully, exercising regularly is one of the ways you can do that. As you should have learned in biology class, your lungs bring oxygen into the body and expel carbon dioxide – when you exercise, this process happens more quicker and makes your lungs stronger and more efficient over time.Studies have shown that slumped sitting decreases lung capacity, because the position squeezes your lungs, making them smaller. So, for a very quick fix, sit up straight to get the best lung capacity you can. A good posture can help with back pain, too.If you live in a city, air pollution is unavoidable. Even short-term air pollution can affect your lungs. But there are steps you can take to improve the air quality at home. Keeping it clean will help get rid of dust, while keeping house plants could help keep the air fresh, depending on the species. On days when pollution levels are low, be sure to open the windows."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4778a52f41ff39672eed0ff092d2ace1ef604e5/0_143_2658_1594/master/2658.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70d3ea4cb819b054c6242b5b631379bc","title":"amy winehouse footage back to black dvd","story":"The DVD release of documentary Back to Black includes footage of a private London show hosted by Winehouse in February 2008Back to Black, a new documentary on the making of Amy Winehouse’s 2006 album of the same name, arrives on 2 November.

It made her the fifth female solo artist to win five awards in one night, following Lauryn Hill, Norah Jones, Alicia Keys and Beyoncé.Then 24, Winehouse had recently entered a drug rehabilitation programme and was initially refused a work visa to travel to the US for the Grammys ceremony in Los Angeles. American officials reversed the decision, by which time it was too late for her to make the trip.Instead, she staged this concert for family, friends and her record label, Island. Winehouse accepted her awards in a video transmission from Riverside studios: footage of the singer looking stunned as Back to Black was named record of the year went viral.The documentary Back to Black tells the story of Winehouse’s second and final album and features previously unseen footage of the singer, along with new interviews with producers Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi and other collaborators. In the film, Winehouse describes Back to Black as “an album that I’m really proud of about a bad situation that I got through”.The documentary is the second about Winehouse following Asif Kapadia’s 2015 film Amy.

West has been a vocal supporter of Donald Trump since the 2016 election campaign. He recently visited Trump inside the Oval Office, ostensibly to discuss prison reform – an issue his wife, Kim Kardashian West, has previously discussed at the White House.Surrounded by reporters and cameras, West launched into an impassioned stream of consciousness touching on race relations, tax breaks, criminal justice and mental health.

Talent is spread evenly and the challenge with Britain is that opportunity isn’t and that’s what we have got to fix.”Her comments will fuel ongoing speculation about the prime minister’s future, as the number of MPs backing a leadership contest is believed to be close to the threshold of 48 necessary to trigger a vote. Many of those MPs are known to be hard Brexiters disgruntled with what they see as May’s concessions to the EU.If she ran as leader, Greening would hope to draw support from the other wing of the party and the majority of Tory MPs who backed remain in the referendum.Greening resigned from the government after being offered the post of work and pensions secretary in May’s January reshuffle.Since leaving the cabinet she has been outspoken about the need for the Tories to broaden their appeal to younger, more socially liberal voters. In June, she ruled herself out of the running to be the Conservatives’ candidate for mayor of London.She told ITV: “We need a guarantee on opportunity for people in country in the same way that we tried to give them guarantees on health … I didn’t have a life mission to come into politics. I just want to see change on the ground, it is as simple as that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7ca2819308d17929dee450b6fc3a30a7b613231/0_61_4102_2461/master/4102.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=798b1f9b7eb1830c2662c78fe65ab71b","title":"boston red sox win world series 2018 la dodgers baseball","story":"Red Sox first baseman Steve Pearce started Game 5 of the World Series the same way he and his Boston teammates finished Game 4 – by sticking a dagger in the heart of the Dodgers.Mercifully for the battered Dodgers, there will be no more punishment. Boston used four home runs and seven spectacular innings from David Price to best Los Angeles by a score of 5-1 on Sunday night to clinch the best-of-seven series 4-1. It is the franchise’s fourth World Series since 2004 and their ninth overall.Pearce, a midseason acquisition from Toronto, carried the momentum from his game-deciding hits from Game 4 by smashing a two-run home run deep into the left field bleachers off Clayton Kershaw in the first inning Sunday. The runs proved to be the only offense the Red Sox would need for the rest of the night. The 35 year-old, 11-year veteran also hit a solo home run in the eighth inning to ice the finale and forever etch his name in Red Sox lore by winning the World Series MVP award. He finished the series with four hits in 12 at bats, three home runs and eight RBI.“We are a bunch of grinders,” Pearce said after the game, “and this is exactly where we knew we were going to be.”Boston never looked back from that damaging first inning: the Dodgers’ bats that went cold for deep stretches of the series were ineffective once again on a balmy Los Angeles evening. Indeed, the Dodgers seemed to be affected by one of the most debilitating defeats in franchise history the night before, when the Red Sox surmounted a four-run deficit with eight runs in the final three innings of Game 4.There was some fight from the home team early on. Dodgers first baseman David Freese reduced the deficit to 2-1 in the bottom of the first inning by whacking a lead-off home run off Price. It was the 10th career postseason home run for the first baseman, who also tripled in the third inning. But it was essentially all the offense the Dodgers had in store for the night. They only managed one other hit the rest of the game.Game 5 featured a battle between Cy Young Award-winning stalwarts who have both been battered throughout their turbulent playoff careers. Kershaw came into the game with a career record of 9-9 in the postseason with a 4.28 ERA. Price’s playoff record – 4-9, with a 4.87 ERA – wasn’t any better, but the pitcher saved his best for when it mattered most. On Sunday, he pitched seven innings and gave up just one run, and walked off the mound to a standing ovation from the Boston supporters, who attended the series in Los Angeles in droves.“I can’t say enough about what Clayton what our guys did,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “Unfortunately we came up short again this year.”With a potential championship clincher hanging in the balance, the patches of red in the stands were noticeable, and the Red Sox fans controlled the energy in the stadium for most of the night. In the ninth inning, and with victory in sight, they even managed a shot at their old rivals as a “Yankees Suck” chant broke out.After allowing Pearce’s home run, Kershaw returned to the mound and recorded 15 outs without allowing a run until Mookie Betts hit a sixth-inning pitch deep into the bleachers. JD Martinez followed with a solo shot of his own the inning after.The series lasted just five games but featured memorable moments, highlighted by the longest ever World Series game in Game 3.The Dodgers have now suffered successive World Series defeats and watched their adversaries celebrate on their home field in back-to-back years. The franchise’s championship drought has now reached 30 years. On the other hand, “The Curse of the Bambino” that led to an 86-year championship drought in Boston is an afterthought for the Red Sox these days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd0bf1b151310b289395f63c5e88c2e5a1b811bc/0_100_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a64eb2bbef88517cea8415977db61630","title":"cricket australia arrogant and partly to blame for ball tampering report finds","story":"Cricket Australia has been branded “arrogant” and “controlling” and partly responsible for the ball-tampering incident that led to bans for former captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner.An independent report into the organisation’s culture found there was “strong systemic and organisational input” into the decision to cheat during the third Test against South Africa in Cape Town in March.Interviewees said Australian cricket’s governing body adopted bullying behaviour, ostracised people and created a “win-at-all-costs” mentality that pushed players to “play the mongrel”.The strong words of the review are likely to lead to calls for more lenient sentences for Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft. Smith was handed a 12-month ban, Bancroft nine months and Warner – who was identified as the ringleader – a 12-month ban and a guarantee that he would never hold a leadership role with the national team.The 147-page report, produced by the the Ethics Centre, was scathing of CA.“The most common description of CA is as ‘arrogant’ and ‘controlling’,” it said. “The core complaint is that the organisation does not respect anyone other than its own. Players feel that they are treated as commodities.“Australian cricket has lost its balance ... and has stumbled badly. The reputation of the game of cricket, as played by men, has been tainted. Women’s cricket remains unaffected.“The ball-tampering incident at the Newlands Ground in South Africa can be seen as an aberration ... However, to think this would be mistaken. We have seen evidence that the structures built around elite cricket are oriented to winning, without properly counting the cost.”The report was also critical of the widespread use of sledging . It said the drive to win meant players were frequently asked to “play the mongrel”.The Cricket Australia chairman, David Peever, said he accepted responsibility for what happened in South Africa.“We wanted to know what was wrong and what we could do better,” he said. “We voluntarily commissioned the review because we wanted to look in the mirror.”But he rejected calls to resign and said he was “looking forward immensely” to the future of Australian cricket.Test captain Tim Paine, who replaced Smith, said he understood the findings of the review into players’ on-field behaviour that led to the establishment of a players’ charter.The Players’ Pact will become “the overarching statement as to how cricketers in Australia should play the game, respecting its traditions”.Paine said he was not surprised the report found players “lived in a bubble”.“Potentially we got a little bit wrapped up in our own self-importance. We are the lucky ones playing for Australia. It’s not our cricket team, it’s Australia’s cricket team and I think for a little while we lost that.”But he would not be drawn on whether the report should lead to leniency for his former teammates.“I don’t think it’s about blame so much. I think everyone has admitted over the last 12 months that there have been mistakes made. To sit here and blame people isn’t going to help anyone.”Peever said the sanctions for the three players would stand.It also recommends that the award of the Allan Border medal take into account character and behaviour as well as performance, and that selectors take into account a player’s character as well as their skills when picking teams.The report also recommends that the role of vice-captain “be de-coupled from that of ‘heir apparent’ for the captaincy”, and that the player’s anti-harassment code be modified to ban abusive sledging.Cricket Australia has fully supported 34 of the recommendations, is considering seven, and rejected one, which would excuse players from international T20 to play Sheffield Shield and grade cricket.Many sections of the report were redacted. Cricket Australia said this was due to defamation risk, at the advice of external lawyers, due to the honesty of the review."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfc662dad7f066f42c3955e0dfa1c46d59fb066e/0_57_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3d6de93fc08c02f0560d62ff011f2ef3 1240w","title":"spooky places to visit uk halloween ghost readers travel tips","story":"Serious history collides with fond imaginings in our tipsters’ tales of the unexplained, from a Spanish Armada wreck to a snuffling ghost poochWindhouse, on Yell, is probably Shetland’s most haunted house.

There are reports of skeletal remains of a woman, man and child found in separate incidents between the 1880s and 1900s, as well as the story of the shipwrecked sailor who spent a night in the house one Christmas and had to fight off a monster with an axe.

It is on two cliffs bridged by a narrow backbone of rock with awesome views in all directions. Peeping through empty stone window frames past the seabirds circling below, it is hard not to consider the stormy night in 1639 when the cooks tumbled to their deaths as the ocean gobbled up the castle’s kitchens or to imagine, over the wind and surf, the screaming of 1,300 sailors of the Spanish Armada as the sea smashed the galley Girona to pieces against the Port-Na Spaniagh cliffs on 26 October 1588, swallowing all but nine souls (who were received by chief Sorley Boy MacDonnell and sent to Scotland).MarkOne of the most beautiful hostelries in Kent, the 14th-century Star and Eagle in Goudhurst has long been haunted by a mysterious invisible dog – so much so that the owners no longer put guests in the particular room that it seems to inhabit. Previous occupants report hearing a dog whining, snuffling and scratching throughout the night, stopping them sleeping. Strangely for a dog, it shows little interest in the ground-floor pub or restaurant – but we had it direct from the owners that it’s been quite a problem in the upstairs rooms and that an array of doggy treats and rawhide chews have so far failed to placate it.Ros KaziThe Prospect of Whitby in Wapping (built around 1520 close to the infamous Execution Dock), is said to be haunted by the ghosts of Mary Frith (AKA Moll Cutpurse) and the cruel Judge John Jeffreys. Frith was a larger-than-life virago, crossdresser, pickpocket and madame in 17th century London, and the subject of a play (The Roaring Girl). Jeffreys often drank in the Prospect, which was his local he died in 1689 while incarcerated at the nearby Tower of London, after being identified by a former victim in another Wapping pub. The Prospect was once known as the Devil’s Tavern because of its gruesome reputation. There are amazing views over the river and a noose hangs outside, commemorating Jeffreys’ grisly deeds. CarolineThe ruins of an old priory sit near the A41M5 Junction 1 roundabout, in West Bromwich. They are occupied by the ghost of an old nun. She presents herself as a hitchhiker and gets into the back seats of cars. She says she is trying to find her sister and asks to be driven to the Heath Lane cemetery. Drivers say their cars immediately become very cold. When they look in their rear view mirror they cannot see her reflection. She lets out a shriek and vanishes. Drivers often experience mechanical trouble at the roundabout.

A deserted and windblown place today, the route was once a busy cross-border drove road. It was here, in 1791, that William Winter’s corpse was left to rot in a gibbet cage following his execution, along with two female accomplices, for the murder of a local woman, Margaret Crozier. Winter’s ghost is reputed to roam the moorland, eternally tied to the place of his crime and the monument dedicated to his disgrace.LeanneTamworth Castle, despite being next to a shopping centre, can be quite eerie at night and offers ghost hunts. Not that I believe in that stuff.

Ah, but here is where even the thickest carapace of ignorance must begin to crack and let a little light shine in. Because, of course, as even the most unwilling of us have learned over the last few elections and referendums, they do.And the most potent example of it is at the heart of the latest Le Carré adaptation. The Little Drummer Girl, whose six-part run began on Sunday night (brought to us by the same people who gave us The Night Manager two years ago, though its lavish, stylish direction comes courtesy of Korean auteur Park Chan-wook) begins with a bomb exploding in the house of an Israeli attache in West Germany, missing him by chance but killing his eight-year-old son. The bomb was planted by a young woman working as part of a network of cells operated by a brilliant and elusive Palestinian named Khalil. It provides the cue for Martin Kurtz (played by the estimable Michael Shannon), the head of a team of Israeli spies working clandestinely – like, even for spies – to step up his mission to find Khalil and stop him. I suspect not by asking him politely.In order to fight fire with fire, Kurtz deems it necessary to recruit a young woman for their side too. I was going to say “slightly implausibly” but again – see The Americans above – I really don’t know. Is it? Should we be marvelling at the accuracy of the rendering of history or at the brio with which nonsense is being made credible and compelling?Whichever way we choose, we can all be grateful for it bringing Charlie into the game. She is played by Florence Pugh with such authentic pugnacity, compressed energy and intelligence that were she not surrounded by such stalwarts as Shannon and – soon to come – Alexander Skarsgård she would be in danger of making everyone else look like a bloodless cipher.Charlie is an actor on a working holiday in Greece with her castmates, paid for by their new anonymous patron. There they are approached by and befriend – you know what actors are like, basically fools – a strange, scarred man called Joseph (Skarsgård in a part that puts to perfect use his strangely ethereal charisma and persistent undertow of melancholy). She alone is suspicious, noticing among other things that he hums a tune unique to the show they did in London before they left.Eventually, and via that rarest of phenomena, a plentiful array of scenes during which they test each other and forge a convincing, idiosyncratic relationship instead of one that simply relies on her being a Hot Young Actor and him looking like Alexander Skarsgård, she agrees to a sort-of date. At the end of it she discovers that her acting ability, ferocious memory and potentially sympathetic politics have made her ideal recruiting material for Kurtz, rather than girlfriend material for Joseph. While he has been seducing her, the rest of the team have been surveilling Khalil’s younger brother Salim – and from next week, the hunt is on.It’s all brilliantly, beautifully done and the dialogue sounds as good as everything else looks. By the end of the hour you’re more firmly recruited than Charlie is. Do I know what is real and what is not? Do I know where to position myself at the border between fact and fiction? I do not. Let Le Carré and his team determine my truth. I’m along for the six-week ride.Want to give your opinion?\u0026nbspOur series recap\u0026nbsphas comments open"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e858811532daf95b1eef483850d0cd3d188a766f/0_12_5550_3330/master/5550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e8e9272f280f39e7ff80bbba0da533d","title":"north dakota id law native americans vote senate race","story":"On the tribal reservations, Republicans are accused of trying to suppress a potentially decisive bloc who tend to swing DemocraticAs the blanket of morning fog evaporates over the outskirts of Fort Yates, a group of volunteers files inside a nondescript yellow building, decorated with signs that read: Standing Rock Will Vote. Everyone here knows the office. It has stood for decades and is owned by the reservation tribal government. But one thing about it has remained a mystery: its address.Until recently that would hardly have mattered. Many properties, from government buildings to small homes, have no formal street address. Members of the Lakota Sioux tribe who live on Standing Rock, like the Native Americans on four other reservations in North Dakota, just know where people live. Most residents use PO Boxes to collect their mail. For years, thousands have used their PO Boxes when registering formal identification documents.Now, with less than two weeks left before the crucial midterm elections, that poses a problem some fear could change the outcome in a pivotal race.Following a supreme court decision earlier in the month, North Dakota’s voter ID laws will go into effect in November. That means voters will be forced to show ID documents that include a full address before they can cast a ballot. The Republican-backed law has been branded a deliberate attempt to suppress the Native American vote.“They proposed this legislation and never invited us to be at the table,” said Danielle Ta’Sheena Finn, Standing Rock’s external affairs director. “We were not invited to propose comments or questions or concerns. It was done almost under the rug, which tells you the intent.”Inside the unnamed yellow building, the small army of volunteers, brought together by a coalition of Native civil rights groups, are determined to fight back. They plan to knock on every single door in the northern side of this vast reservation, which straddles North and South Dakota, and bus people to the single government building issuing new tribal ID cards until all Standing Rock’s population has the documentation required.It is a mammoth task, in an open place where 3,000 eligible voters live in communities dotted around 1,128 square miles of land.Alva Cottonwood-Gabe sat in the office, her old tribal ID card in her hand. It expired years ago but the 57-year-old, who lives on $393 a month in food stamps and other government subsistence, simply could not afford to pay $5 to replace it.“I’ve got four grandchildren to support and I need it to pay for other things in the home,” she said.Following the supreme court decision, tribal governments in all of North Dakota’s reservations moved to waive the fee for new documents – soaking up the costs themselves. Cottonwood-Gabe was among the first to be bussed in to collect her new ID, which she brandished above her head, a small marker of victory. It was identical to her previous ID card, bar a single line that noted her address was 568 Sioux Avenue.The laborious process, which involved three forms and a queue at the federal office, was a reminder to her of what she believed was the new law’s true intent.“They are trying to suppress our vote because they don’t want to hear what we have to say,” she said. “But voting is so important, not just for me but for my children, my grandchildren, my great grandchildren.”A mother of 13 and grandmother of 20, Cottonwood-Gabe is a veteran of the pipeline protests that commanded international attention in 2016. She was maced three times in clashes with police and left partially deaf in one ear, after authorities used sound cannons.She has lived in Standing Rock her whole life and voted in every election since 1984. Environmental protection, she said, was the issue that concerned her the most at this year’s election.The battle for the US Senate seat in North Dakota is among the most crucial races in the midterms. Democratic incumbent Heidi Heitkamp faces Republican congressman Kevin Cramer in an election that could be decided by just a few thousand votes. If Democrats cannot hold the seat, it will be almost impossible for them to take the Senate. Heitkamp, who voted against Donald Trump’s controversial supreme court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, currently trails in the polls.Almost immediately after Heitkamp was elected, Republicans in the state legislature passed the voter ID law. Following court rulings that initially blocked it, 2018 will be the first election the law is in full effect.Cramer, an arch-conservative, has like other Republicans in the state argued the law is vital to protect against voter fraud. At a debate last week he suggested there was no discriminatory effect and accused the law’s critics of playing “identity politics”.North Dakota, the only state in the union that does not require iniduals to register before they vote, has prosecuted just one case of voter fraud in decades. According to the Standing Rock tribal council, there has never been a cases of voter fraud in Sioux county, the jurisdiction that covers all of Standing Rock’s territory in the state.For some the new laws were a further reminder of the state’s racist past, in which it legally disenfranchised most of Native voters. At the turn of the 20th century North Dakota’s constitution gave the right to vote only to “civilised persons of Indian descent” who had ended their ties to tribal government. Like the Jim Crow laws of the south, the discrimination was formally ended with the passing of the 1965 Voting Rights Act – a defining achievement of the civil rights movement.But since a 2013 supreme court decision weakened key provisions of that law, the voting rights of minority groups like Native Americans have come under frequent attack.Standing at the top of a hill that overlooked Fort Yates, as autumn leaves swirled in the wind, Chase Iron Eyes looked out over his childhood home.“This history that we have here is not set up to honour us as human beings or honour our right to participate in democracy,” he said.“The government didn’t need a physical address to come and steal our children for boarding school. The government didn’t need a physical address when it was time for us to be conscripted into their militaries. But now they need a physical address so that we can exercise one of the most basic principles and tenets of a representative democracy.”“Every election is such a beast. There’s got to be an organized, consistent effort to get our people – disempowered, disenfranchised oppressed people – to give a shit about their destiny. That’s a hard thing to do.”Over the two days of door knocking observed by the , dozens of Standing Rock residents said they had already been out to collect new ID documents. But canvassers were concerned by a few incidents that illustrated the strict requirements now in place.Residents were being told to fill in their forms in blue ink: clerks at the county offices had rejected applications written in black and green. One Standing Rock resident, Dale Ramsey, had his application for a new ID rejected as he had previously listed an address outside the reservation on a separate document. (He had been homeless at the time and so registered at a shelter outside Standing Rock.) As it stood, he would not be able to vote.The tribe were also concerned that two out of the five polling stations inside the reservation would only be open from midday on election day – the other three will be open from 9am.Volunteers were encouraging voters to cast their ballot early, at the county courthouse, by applying in person for an absentee ballot and handing it straight back with the vote cast. But the tiny offices there were burdened with other municipal duties too.Out in the remote settlement town of Selfridge, 34-year-old Honorata Defender and three other volunteers were knocking on doors. On one dusty street, 81-year-old James Cowry opened the door, surprised to be receiving visitors.He had lived in his home for three decades and had never known its formal address. The volunteers told him to call the local 911 coordinator, who would give him the information. But he had still not decided whether to vote.“I don’t feel for the candidates either way,” he said.Defender vowed to come back and drive him 30 miles down the road to pick up his ID card later in the week.“Every vote should count,” she said. “I’ll do all that I can to help you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places. Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world.

She will also not seek re-election to the Bundestag.The statements were made following a meeting of the party leadership, which was called to discuss two electoral disasters in regional elections in as many weeks. She had earlier announced her decision to the party, when her “moving words” were greeted with a standing ovation, sources told German media.Merkel said her 13 years as chancellor had been “a daily challenge and honour” but she recognised it was time to start a new chapter.It had been widely assumed that this would be Merkel’s final term as chancellor but she had not confirmed that herself. The 64-year-old, who has been CDU chairwoman since 2000 and chancellor since 2005, was due to give a press conference at 1pm (1200 GMT).Whoever becomes the next CDU leader will likely be put forward as the party’s candidate for chancellor in 2021. Merkel’s favoured successor is the CDU party secretary general, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who announced her candidacy on Monday.German media reported that Friedrich Merz, a former parliamentary leader of the CDUCSU alliance, was also joining the race to succeed Merkel. Other favourites are the health minister Jens Spahn and the state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet.The German news agency DPA reported that Merkel intended to continue as chancellor for now. Traditionally, the person who holds position of party chair of the government’s largest party also takes position of chancellor, but this is not a binding rule. Previously Merkel has said the two jobs belong together.Merkel’s predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, made the same move in February 2004, giving up the position of chairman but remaining chancellor until November 2005. At the time, Merkel, who was then leader of the opposition, spoke of a “loss of authority all along the line”, and “the beginning of the end” of Schröder.Christian Lindner, the leader of the liberal FDP party, was the first to demand Merkel’s resignation as chancellor on the back of the news, calling for her ruling conservative bloc to “be prepared for a real new beginning in Germany”.Merkel’s CDU allies, however, seem ready to accept her decision to stay on as chancellor for now. The former president of the German parliament Norbert Lammert told Die Welt it was acceptable as part of a “transition phase”, whereas the head of the CDU in the German state of Thuringia, Mike Mohring, spoke of a “turning point”. Others greeted the chance for renewal in the party.After news of Merkel’s decision not to stand for re-election as leader of the CDU, Nahles ruled out a change in leadership in her party. “A personnel configuration is not being discussed in the SPD,” she told journalists on Monday morning.The euro fell to session lows on Monday. Merkel’s weakness at home may limit her capacity to lead in the EU at a time when the bloc is dealing with Brexit, a budget crisis in Italy and the prospect of populist parties making gains at European parliament elections next May.The trouncing for the German coalition parties on Sunday came shortly after a disastrous result in Bavaria, widely seen as a protest against the failings of the Berlin government. The Hesse result will be seen as further evidence of the shrinking of the mainstream political landscape across Germany and Europe more widely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e35d8e8550c2132cfb162c0c5360cfe2458fca5/20_12_2540_1524/master/2540.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3659172cf180da4ca258cd91ec7aa2cb","title":"hunt and burt to be cross examined over uk relations with saudi arabia khashoggi","story":"Foreign Office claims no link between Khashoggi murder and conduct of Yemen civil warUK ministers will face intense pressure this week to explain continued support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen in the wake of the revelations about the premeditated murder of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi by allies of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.The Middle East minister, Alistair Burt, and the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, will be separately cross-examined about Britain’s relations with Saudi Arabia in the Commons, amid reports in British newspapers that UK intelligence may have known in advance that the Saudis were preparing to kill or capture Khashoggi.The Foreign Office, in common with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, says there is no link between the Khashoggi murder and the conduct of the four-year civil war in Yemen, yet in reality ministers privately admit tolerance of the crown prince’s aggressive strategy is wearing thin. Macron on Saturday called for a united European response to Khashoggi’s killing, but is in dispute with Germany whether the sanctions should be directed against iniduals or the Saudi regime.Burt – who met Yemeni officials at the weekend in Bahrain – faces the international development select committee on Tuesday, and Hunt for the first time will be quizzed by the foreign affairs select committee on Wednesday. There are signs that senior Conservatives MPs have lost patience with Saudi Arabia.The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is maintaining steady pressure on the Saudis by demanding they reveal the whereabouts of Khashoggi’s body, or the identity of a so-called local cooperator who disposed of the body after he was murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The Saudi attorney general, Saud al-Mojeb, was due to arrive in Istanbul on Sunday, and if he fails to identify the local cooperator, the west will again question whether the Saudis are serious about ensuring the Turkish investigation identifies the true culprits.Saudi Arabia has claimed a gang of 15 Saudi officials exceeded their authority in killing Khashoggi, a persistent critic of Riyadh. The Saudi court says a number of intelligence officers have also been arrested, including the deputy head of intelligence, Ahmed al-Asiri, a close ally of the crown prince.Although there is no formal read across between the war in Yemen and the political status of the crown prince, the more he is exposed in the Khashoggi affair, the more the rationale for his as-yet-unsuccessful military strategy in Yemen comes under scrutiny.The formal British ministerial position is that the UK is entitled to sell arms to Saudi to be used in Yemen since the Saudi conduct of the war is not in breach of international humanitarian law.But Labour claims the UK government insistence there is no military solution to the war in Yemen is not supported by any true British diplomatic pressure on Saudi to negotiate an end to hostilities, either through meaningful private pressure or an initiative at the United Nations, where the UK is the pen-holder on Yemen. The UK points out that the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels fighting the UN-backed government pose a genuine threat to Saudi Arabia.Critics claim the Saudis have no diplomatic strategy for ending the war. A further 21 civilians were killed in Saudi airstrikes close to the strategic port of Hodeidah late last month.The survival of Yemen’s UN-backed government led by President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi is totally dependent on support from Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates.Hadi went to Washington last week in a surprise visit that may be linked to his health as well as the pressure rising in Congress for the war to be brought to an end.The Saudis at the weekend rejected Erdoğan’s request that the group of 15 Saudi officials suspected of killing Khashoggi be tried in Turkey. The Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, at the Manama security dialogue in Bahrain rejected the proposal, and described the criticism of Saudi Arabia as hysterical.Western governments believe Erdoğan still has as-yet-unreleased audio tapes that could damage Saudi Arabia’s reputation further. Other states have been briefed that the gang responsible for killing Khashoggi made four calls to the crown prince’s office during the period of the murder, and say it is not credible that the crown prince was not informed of the operation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a07503dfb1bab279b54e8c9d5cbcc9771837bbf/0_147_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35d0546c6dbc98a0c475a4a7941b445d","title":"lion air plane lost contact indonesia flight jt610 jakarta","story":"Communication lost with Lion Air plane carrying 189 people minutes after takeoffA passenger plane carrying 189 people has crashed into the sea off Jakarta minutes after taking off on a domestic flight to an Indonesian tin-mining region.Lion Air flight JT610, travelling from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang on the island of Bangka, lost contact with air traffic control about 13 minutes after it took off, shortly after its pilot had asked to return to base. Flight data showed it made a sudden, sharp e into the sea.Officials said human remains had been recovered from the crash site, about nine miles (15km) off the coast, and that they did not expect to find survivors.The plane was a Boeing 737 Max 8 jet, a new model that was launched globally only last year. The specific plane had been in use for less than three months. Lion Air’s chief executive, Edward Sirait, told reporters the plane had suffered “a technical issue” on Sunday night but engineers had cleared it to fly on Monday morning.“This plane previously flew from Denpasar to Jakarta,” he said. “There was a report of a technical issue which had been resolved according to procedure.”Sirait did not elaborate on the specific issue, and said he had no plans to ground the rest of Lion Air’s Max 8 fleet. The airline operates 11 of the Boeing planes.On Monday rescuers released footage of debris and personal items floating in the water at the crash site, including handbags, clothing, mobile phones, ID cards and driving licences.Dozens of ers from the national search and rescue agency and the military were working to retrieve the bodies of victims.At Soekarno-Hatta airport in Jakarta, relatives arrived at the airport crisis centre, many too distressed to talk to the media.Tugi, a Jakarta resident, came to inquire about his friend Wendy. “I came to try and get some information but they can’t give us any answers,” he said. “They don’t know yet, so I am going home and will monitor the media reports from there.”Forensics officers have told family members of those on board they can assist with the identification process by providing medical and dental records at the police hospital in East Jakarta.About 20 of the 189 people onboard were Indonesian finance department officials who had travelled to Jakarta for a conference. Three children, two of them infants, and eight crew members were also among those on board.A statement from Indonesia’s search and rescue agency said the aircraft’s emergency locator transmitter had not sent out a distress signal despite being certified to work until August 2019.The plane went down in waters about 30-35 metres (98-115 ft) deep. Indonesia’s disaster agency spokesman posted video of debris on Twitter.Another official said he could not confirm the cause of the crash, with the plane’s black box, comprising the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, yet to be recovered. But it was confirmed that the pilot had requested to turn back shortly after takeoff.“We will collect all data from the control tower,” said Soerjanto Tjahjono, the official. “The plane is so modern, it transmits data from the plane and that we will review too. But the most important is the black box.”On Monday afternoon the national search and rescue agency said it had determined the location of the black box, but had yet to retrieve it.The Lion Air plane that crashed into the sea moments after takeoff on Monday had been used by the airline for only two months. It has been described as the “world’s most reliable airplane”.The 737 MAX 8 model was first operated for a commercial flight in May 2017 by Malindo Air, but has since been adopted by airlines globally. The plane is a variant of the Boeing 737 Max series, which is the fastest selling plane in Boeing history. Worth upwards of £70m, the Max 8 version has an air range of 6,570km and\u0026nbsp a passenger capacity of up to 210. The planes are built at Boeing’s factory in Renton, Washington, in the US.The plane has been purchased by airlines across the world, including American Airlines, United Airlines, Ryanair, Jet Airlines, FlyDubai, Norwegian Air, Iceland Air, SilkAir, Turkish Airlines, Korean Air, Air Canada and Malaysia Airlines.The crash in Indonesia was the first incident involving the 737 Max model. In a statement released after the Indonesia crash, Boeing said the company “stands ready to provide technical assistance to the accident investigation.The incident is the first to be reported that involves the widely sold Boeing 737 Max 8, an updated, more fuel-efficient version of the common 737. The first Boeing 737 Max jets were introduced into service in 2017. Boeing released a statement saying it was closely monitoring the situation.The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, expressed his condolences in a televised address.Australian government officials have been instructed not to fly Lion Air until the cause of the crash can be determined.Indonesia is one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets, although its safety record is patchy. The crash could potentially be the country’s second-worst air disaster since 1997, industry experts said.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b83c441387eb4e32b8f54f487c1d7e2d012538b3/191_30_1870_1122/master/1870.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e7a4e0236ae6932c515677071bb3478","title":"the remains of stalin gulag railroad soviet union a photo essay","story":"In Russia’s Arctic wilderness, the remnants of one of the Soviet Union’s most notorious gulag projects lie largely forgottenFrom 1947 until 1953, tens of thousands of prisoners, many of them “politicals” convicted for “anti-Soviet acts”, were shipped to northern Russia to lay a railroad through some of the harshest terrain on Earth.The railroad would have connected Russia’s Arctic waters with its western railway network.Most records relating to the gulags, the brutal network of forced-labour camps for dissenters, criminals, and other perceived threats, remain secret. But it is likely that Stalin, spooked by the incursion of Nazi submarines into the Arctic during the second world war, wanted the railway in place as a means of supplying a planned naval port. The railway also would have connected northern nickel mines to Soviet factories in the west.But just days after Stalin’s death in 1953, the project was cancelled amid the subsequent Soviet “thaw”. Since then, the railway’s gulag camps have lain abandoned, sinking further into the forest under the weight of each winter’s snow. Getting to the camps today is difficult outside of winter, with most lying beyond terrain that would bog a tank.Only specialised vehicles, like this balloon-tyred Trekol in which Chapple travelled, are able to move through the swampy region where the railroad was laid.But the biggest threat to survival, according to another former prisoner, came from the brutal winters, which frequently dropped below -40C (-40F).Prisoners were kept ided in gendered barracks. One survivor, Alexandr Snovsky, says the men would throw letters into the female zone to communicate in secret.Some remains, such as this shack that probably housed guards, have been maintained and are regularly used by hunters.Most engineers engaged on the railway were free workers, while the heavy labour was carried out by prisoners. Most of the railway, as evidenced by this old signal marker, has fallen into ruin.For Snovsky, who now lives with his wife near St Petersburg, the biggest tragedy was the project’s futility: “Tens of thousands of human lives for nothing.

So naming a bridge linking to the two areas after him would be appropriate.”The online petition launched by a number of Gallagher fans earlier this week has already received almost 400 signatures from people urging Cork City Council to consider naming the new €5 million pedestrian bridge across the North Channel of the Lee after the highly acclaimed guitarist.In a statement, the group said: “Rory Gallagher grew up in Cork city and he bought his first electric guitar from the iconic Crowley’s music shop on Merchant’s Quay. His legion of fans is growing even to this day as his music is timeless and s across generations, inspiring young guitarists to play.“Cork is a vibrant city renowned for its music and due to the significance of MacCurtain Street and that whole area in Rory’s life and musical career, it would be very appropriate to name the new bridge after Rory.”Cork City Council recently invited members of the public to nominate names for the bridge and among the others to have been suggested is Cork-born Mary Elmes, who was honoured for her work in helping Jewish children escape from the Nazis-occupied France during the second World War.Among the other names mentioned are those of Cork character, Katty Barry, famous for selling crubeens (pig trotters) and author, Ethel Voynich, daughter of mathematician, George Boole, whose novel about revolution, The Gadfly, sold an estimated 2.5 million copies in the former Soviet Union.The bridge, which will carry an estimated 11,000 pedestrians and cyclists across the north channel of the River Lee daily, has been designed by ARUP \u0026amp Wilkinson Eyre Architects and is currently being fabricated off-site by engineering firm, Thompsons of Carlow.The bridge section will be transported by truck for final assembly in Cork Harbour where it will be placed on a barge and transported up river to the city centre in April 2019. It will then be lifted by crane from the barge into place in one overnight operation.The barge journey will be timed to coincide with the optimum tide level for clear passage under Brian Boru Bridge and the installation will involve the closure of both Merchant’s Quay and St Patrick’s Quay during the operation."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000177653497_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0go9KzD8cVu9iguqnaKUswZA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"bbc legal correspondent wrong say nda signed freely","story":"BBC legal correspondent criticised for saying NDA was signed freely Court of AppealThe BBC has been told it is “inaccurate” to claim that women who entered into non-disclosure agreements after they had made allegations about sexual harassment did so “freely”.Media and employment lawyers have said it is likely there would be an “imbalance of power” during negotiations to settle a claim and therefore it was incorrect to view these contractual relationships as free of “abuse”.Yesterday, a BBC journalist claimed the judgment by the Court of Appeal “made clear that there was no evidence any of the NDAs resulted from bullying, harassment or undue pressure”.

Empress Michiko, who he famously met on a tennis court 61 years ago.However, female members of the Imperial family still face having to renounce their royal status upon marrying commoners, according to the nation’s strict succession laws.The Princess\u0026#39s hair was sleeked back in distinct aristocratic styleThe Imperial family’s loss of Princess Ayako – who will receive a one-off payment of around £744,000 (107 million yen) from the state  – brings the total number of family members to 18, including 13 women.The figures reflect the growing succession crisis facing Japan’s shrinking royal family, with only four male heirs to the throne currently remaining, including Crown Prince Naruhito, who will take over when his father abdicates next year.Princess Ayako, who currently works as a research fellow in Social Work Studies at Josai International University in Chiba Prefecture, was introduced to Mr Moriya by her mother last December.Mr Moriya, whose hobbies include marathons and triathlons, attended schools in Paris, Switzerland and the UK before graduating from prestigious Keio University in Tokyo.The bride instantly connected with Mr Moriya, whose late mother was reportedly a long-time close friend of the bride’s mother, when they first met, telling media this summer: “I remember that our conversation got so lively that it didn’t feel like we had just met and that I had so much fun that I forgot about time.”Meanwhile, Princess Mako, the oldest grandchild of the Emperor, had also planned to marry her fiancé Kei Komura this year, before the nuptials were postponed for two years due to insufficient preparations.Please review our commenting policyComment: The public is losing faith in capitalism and the market.

Job cuts would probably affect Asda’s petrol, bakery, back office and “hosting” operations, as well as roles in its clothing arm, George, according to Press Association. In a statement, the company said: “In a competitive retail market, where customers rightly expect great value and ease of service, we must always look at how we can work more quickly and efficiently for them\u0026nbspand, inevitably, that means we need to consider changing the roles we need our colleagues to do, or the hours needed in particular parts of our stores.Asda cuts price of petrol by 2p a litreAsda customers steal shopping baskets to avoid paying for bags What removal of Asda price guarantee scheme will mean for shoppers“We believe the proposed changes we are consulting on would allow us to do a better job for our customers.“We also recognise that discussions about potential change aren’t easy. If the decision is taken to implement the proposed changes, we would work with our colleagues to look at the potential impact of these proposals on them.”The GMB union said Asda’s decision to announce potential job cuts just two months before Christmas was a bad one. Gary Carter, the union’s national officer,\u0026nbspsaid: “These proposed redundancies are a hammer blow to Asda workers. The timing of this announcement, in the run up to Christmas, is doubly appalling.”He added: “Asda is performing well and is highly profitable because of the hard work of our members, who are the backbone of the company. “These cuts make no sense whatsoever – slashing our members’ jobs would hurt the service ASDA customers receive. GMB will fight tooth and nail for every single job.“With all the speculation surrounding the proposed Sainsbury’s merger and potential sell offs of stores – this news will not put anyone’s mind at rest.”Asda and Sainsbury’s announced plans for a £10bn tie-up in April\u0026nbspand the deal is being scrutinised by the competition watchdog.Last month, Asda announced it was scrapping its price guarantee scheme, which gave customers money off if the cost of their shop was not 10 per cent cheaper than if bought at a rival chain. The company said at the time: “It’s a decision we’ve not taken lightly because we love it dearly, but in reality, we know our customers don’t love it enough for us to keep it.“Instead they want us to focus our investment on lowering our prices, and they’ll let us know if we’re falling out of step with the competition.”In July, the supermarket said it was entering into consultation with colleagues at its Enfield Home Shopping Centre in London, putting 261 jobs at risk.

Firms including BP, Rio Tinto and Volkswagen\u0026nbspare facing calls to reconsider their ties to lobbying organisations whose climate change policies do not match up to the Paris Agreement\u0026nbsptargets. Investors have written to 55 companies, asking them to “review the lobbying positions being adopted by the organisations of which you are a member”, particularly any groups that might oppose progressive climate change policies. Unilever, Nestle and Rolls-Royce\u0026nbspwere also approached. The 55 firms have been chosen due to their high greenhouse gas emissions and “significant role in energy-intensive sectors”, investors said. The decision to take action on “back-door” lobbying comes weeks after the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that greenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert a global environmental catastrophe.He may have accepted it but Trump will do nothing about climate changeClimate change to cause global beer shortage, research showsBanks and insurers must plan for climate change risks, says BoEGovernment urged to act fast on climate change after UN warningUnder current climate commitments by world leaders, the Earth will be 3C warmer by the end of the century, according to the IPCC’s report. The worst effects of global warming – including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities – will only be avoided if the global temperature increase stays below 1.5C. Scientists think this figure will be exceeded within around 20 years. Adam Matthews, of the Church of England Pensions Board, said: “Misleading and misaligned corporate lobbying practices undermine the ability of governments to act on climate change and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The influence of trade associations is often exerted behind closed doors and can be deeply insidious to public policymaking on climate change. “As the recent report from the IPCC clearly highlighted, the stakes are high and time is against us. It is therefore right that investors are challenging Europe’s most high-emitting companies to ensure consistency in their lobbying practices.”Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, said: “Long-term investors have a clear interest in the Paris Agreement being implemented to support the necessary transition to a low-carbon global economy. Shareholders should rightly expect companies in which they invest to advocate for the climate policy required for this to happen. This includes ensuring the trade bodies of which they are members are working to the same end.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Under Irish corporate law you need the support of three times that.\u0026nbspBut it should be forthcoming. Some 30 per cent of Ryanair’s investors voted against Bonderman’s re-election the last time around.\u0026nbspThey had good reasons for opposing another year of the septuagenerian American. He’s been in post for more than 20 years. That would raise questions about his ability to serve as a check on the power of the CEO, and an independent voice on behalf of shareholders, at any company, let alone one run by a man like O’Leary.\u0026nbspWhen you serve for that long it’s not just furniture you have in your title. You become part of it.\u0026nbspBut this isn’t really about Bonderman. It’s about O’Leary, a man for whom pugilism is as natural as breathing is to the rest of us.\u0026nbspThe LAPFF, and other progressive voices among Ryanair’s investors, have raised issues about the aggressive way he runs the the company in the past.\u0026nbspBut he, and Bonderman, and the rest of the company’s directors, have been able to ignore them because of Ryanair’s previously stellar financial and share price performance.\u0026nbspThere aren’t many shareholders that will square up to a winner, even when the seeds of\u0026nbsptrouble are easy enough to see.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Job cuts would probably affect Asda’s petrol, bakery, back office and “hosting” operations, as well as roles in its clothing arm, George, according to Press Association. In a statement, the company said: “In a competitive retail market, where customers rightly expect great value and ease of service, we must always look at how we can work more quickly and efficiently for them\u0026nbspand, inevitably, that means we need to consider changing the roles we need our colleagues to do, or the hours needed in particular parts of our stores.Asda cuts price of petrol by 2p a litreAsda customers steal shopping baskets to avoid paying for bags What removal of Asda price guarantee scheme will mean for shoppers“We believe the proposed changes we are consulting on would allow us to do a better job for our customers.“We also recognise that discussions about potential change aren’t easy. If the decision is taken to implement the proposed changes, we would work with our colleagues to look at the potential impact of these proposals on them.”The GMB union said Asda’s decision to announce potential job cuts just two months before Christmas was a bad one. Gary Carter, the union’s national officer,\u0026nbspsaid: “These proposed redundancies are a hammer blow to Asda workers. The timing of this announcement, in the run up to Christmas, is doubly appalling.”He added: “Asda is performing well and is highly profitable because of the hard work of our members, who are the backbone of the company. “These cuts make no sense whatsoever – slashing our members’ jobs would hurt the service ASDA customers receive. GMB will fight tooth and nail for every single job.“With all the speculation surrounding the proposed Sainsbury’s merger and potential sell offs of stores – this news will not put anyone’s mind at rest.”Asda and Sainsbury’s announced plans for a £10bn tie-up in April\u0026nbspand the deal is being scrutinised by the competition watchdog.Last month, Asda announced it was scrapping its price guarantee scheme, which gave customers money off if the cost of their shop was not 10 per cent cheaper than if bought at a rival chain. The company said at the time: “It’s a decision we’ve not taken lightly because we love it dearly, but in reality, we know our customers don’t love it enough for us to keep it.“Instead they want us to focus our investment on lowering our prices, and they’ll let us know if we’re falling out of step with the competition.”In July, the supermarket said it was entering into consultation with colleagues at its Enfield Home Shopping Centre in London, putting 261 jobs at risk.

Firms including BP, Rio Tinto and Volkswagen\u0026nbspare facing calls to reconsider their ties to lobbying organisations whose climate change policies do not match up to the Paris Agreement\u0026nbsptargets. Investors have written to 55 companies, asking them to “review the lobbying positions being adopted by the organisations of which you are a member”, particularly any groups that might oppose progressive climate change policies. Unilever, Nestle and Rolls-Royce\u0026nbspwere also approached. The 55 firms have been chosen due to their high greenhouse gas emissions and “significant role in energy-intensive sectors”, investors said. The decision to take action on “back-door” lobbying comes weeks after the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that greenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert a global environmental catastrophe.He may have accepted it but Trump will do nothing about climate changeClimate change to cause global beer shortage, research showsBanks and insurers must plan for climate change risks, says BoEGovernment urged to act fast on climate change after UN warningUnder current climate commitments by world leaders, the Earth will be 3C warmer by the end of the century, according to the IPCC’s report. The worst effects of global warming – including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities – will only be avoided if the global temperature increase stays below 1.5C. Scientists think this figure will be exceeded within around 20 years. Adam Matthews, of the Church of England Pensions Board, said: “Misleading and misaligned corporate lobbying practices undermine the ability of governments to act on climate change and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The influence of trade associations is often exerted behind closed doors and can be deeply insidious to public policymaking on climate change. “As the recent report from the IPCC clearly highlighted, the stakes are high and time is against us. It is therefore right that investors are challenging Europe’s most high-emitting companies to ensure consistency in their lobbying practices.”Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, said: “Long-term investors have a clear interest in the Paris Agreement being implemented to support the necessary transition to a low-carbon global economy. Shareholders should rightly expect companies in which they invest to advocate for the climate policy required for this to happen. This includes ensuring the trade bodies of which they are members are working to the same end.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The lender reported pre-tax profit of $5.9bn (£4.6bn), up from $4.6bn in the same period of last year, and higher than analysts’ expectations of $5.6bn. Revenue also rose, by 6 per cent, to $13.8bn, although the bank said foreign currency translation movements knocked $300m off revenue growth. Meanwhile, expenses were reduced by 2 per cent between the second and third quarter and revenue - spending fell to $7.7bn from $7.9bn.John Flint, who was appointed as HSBC’s chief executive last year, said: “These are encouraging results that demonstrate the revenue potential of HSBC.

The bank’s biggest challenge was to tame its cost. “In its earnings report, the numbers across the board were encouraging.”Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “HSBC may be the second biggest company on the UK stock market, but its profits are predominantly emanating from its historic home in the far east. Three quarters of the bank’s profits so far this year have come from its Asian operations, leaving the European business trailing in its wake.“Profit growth has been broad-based across HSBC’s main banking activities, and what’s positive is that’s coming from a rising top line rather than simply cost-cutting, which can only deliver results for so long. Indeed adjusted operating costs have actually ticked up, though that’s to support investment in growth opportunities, notably in the bank’s digital proposition.”He added: “As an international retail and commercial bank, HSBC is clearly plugged into the global economy, and in particular the fortunes of China and the surrounding area. While in the long term this looks like an ace in the sleeve, investors should expect a bumpy journey, particularly if Trump’s trade war dents growth in the region.”Shares in HSBC rose 4 per cent in early trading.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The lender reported pre-tax profit of $5.9bn (£4.6bn), up from $4.6bn in the same period of last year, and higher than analysts’ expectations of $5.6bn. Revenue also rose, by 6 per cent, to $13.8bn, although the bank said foreign currency translation movements knocked $300m off revenue growth. Meanwhile, expenses were reduced by 2 per cent between the second and third quarter and revenue - spending fell to $7.7bn from $7.9bn.John Flint, who was appointed as HSBC’s chief executive last year, said: “These are encouraging results that demonstrate the revenue potential of HSBC. We are doing what we said we would – delivering growth from areas of strength, and investing in the business while keeping a strong grip on costs. HSBC publishes fairy tale for childrenHSBC profits rise after strong showing in Asia despite trade war fearsHSBC profits fall as bank’s spending outgrows revenue in first quarterHSBC to largely stop funding fossil fuel industries“We remain committed to growing profits, generating value for shareholders and improving the service we offer our customers around the world.” Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said: “The key to satisfy the shareholders is to spend less and deliver higher growth numbers and in today’s earnings report, HSBC has nailed this. The bank’s biggest challenge was to tame its cost. “In its earnings report, the numbers across the board were encouraging.”Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “HSBC may be the second biggest company on the UK stock market, but its profits are predominantly emanating from its historic home in the far east. Three quarters of the bank’s profits so far this year have come from its Asian operations, leaving the European business trailing in its wake.“Profit growth has been broad-based across HSBC’s main banking activities, and what’s positive is that’s coming from a rising top line rather than simply cost-cutting, which can only deliver results for so long. Indeed adjusted operating costs have actually ticked up, though that’s to support investment in growth opportunities, notably in the bank’s digital proposition.”He added: “As an international retail and commercial bank, HSBC is clearly plugged into the global economy, and in particular the fortunes of China and the surrounding area. While in the long term this looks like an ace in the sleeve, investors should expect a bumpy journey, particularly if Trump’s trade war dents growth in the region.”Shares in HSBC rose 4 per cent in early trading.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”.

Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).The BBC has not yet announced when Cox, who is currently the presenter for Radio 2\u0027s 10pm-midnight show Monday to Thursday, will begin her new role on Drivetime.\u0026nbspBefore joining the BBC in 1999, she worked on Channel 4\u0027s\u0026nbspThe Big Breakfast,\u0026nbspMTV and various other shows. She first appeared on Radio 2 in 2011, and has stepped in to host the Radio 2 breakfast show when Chris Evans has been away in recent years.\u0026nbspIn 2013, she got her own show on Radio 2 by launching Sounds of the 80s, which she hosted until earlier this year.\u0026nbspMayo recently denied that his decision to quit had anything to do with Whiley joining the show, following a report in The Sun that claimed he was leaving after being “forced” to work with her.\u0026nbspThe DJ, who has hosted Drivetime since 2010, said he “loved” working with Whiley and added she had been his “first and only” choice when the show was reconfigured.Chris Evans records lowest listening figures in six yearsSeann Walsh becomes latest celebrity to leave Strictly Come DancingSimon Mayo quits Radio 2 show and denies rift with co-host Jo Whiley“Juggling my writing and radio has become increasingly tricky (a nice problem to have),” Mayo said. “I\u0027ve just signed a new 2 book deal with the nice folk at Transworld and they\u0027ll be expecting something half decent before too long.\u0026nbsp“I know, I know, I\u0027m as surprised at this turn of events as you. But at my grand old age to be setting off on these brand new trails is enormous fun. And all the more so for being so unexpected. There are, however, only so many hours in a day.”Addressing reports of a rift between himself and Whiley, he added: “One other thing. maybe it needs to be said, maybe not but there is no room for argument so I\u0027ll be clear. I\u0027ve loved working with the exceptional Jo Whiley and when the show was \u0027reconfigured\u0027 she was my first and only choice.“Some of the abuse she has had here has been appalling. Support for a show is one thing, assaulting the dignity of a warm-hearted and loyal friend is another. So by all means discuss what\u0027s happening here, but let\u0027s keep some civility. Here endeth the lesson.”Whiley is also leaving the Drivetime show, moving to a 7pm-9pm, Monday to Thursday slot to present a new music show.Responding to Mayo\u0027s departure, she said: “I\u0027m incredibly sad that Simon has decided to leave Radio 2. He\u0027s a brilliant broadcaster, a great friend and I really will miss working with him.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We know the UK government has started making such plans as a result of the growing demand for such a vote, demonstrated by last weekend’s march.“The EU should do the same, because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.”UK-EU transport links after Brexit ‘increasingly a cause for concern’MPs ‘far more likely to reject Brexit deal’ if unable to amend itPound sterling falls to six-week low as Theresa May faces Brexit backlPlaid Cymru Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts, who also met with Mr Barnier, said she had used the meeting to push for an extension to the negotiation period to accommodate a referendum.“I pressed Michel Barnier on protecting Wales’s interest through the extension of Article 50 and a People’s Vote,” she said.“In Westminster, with the prime minister’s proposals amounting to nothing more than a mix of fudge and fantasy, a People’s Vote is more likely than ever.”The EU has previously reacted cooly to suggestions that the period could be extended, but has not ruled it out. An extension would require the unanimous approval of all 28 EU leaders on the European Council.\u0026nbspSadiq Khan visited Brussels on Friday\u0026nbsp(Getty)Brussels is particularly wary about extending the transition into May, when Britain would have to take part in the next European Parliament elections if it was still in the EU.Mr Khan, speaking after a separate meeting on Friday, said: “The point I made to Michel Barnier, really quite forcefully, is that there is a possibility of the British parliament rejecting the deal that Mrs May secures from the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

It is only right that they have a say in their nation’s future.”Mr Hutton added: “This careful analysis shows just how badly young people – already disadvantaged by the breakdown of career structures and high housing costs – will be further hit by Brexit.”And Mr\u0026nbspOluwole said: “Now that the implications for our generation have become clear, we need a People’s Vote on the government’s Brexit deal.”The research comes as the Brexit talks remain deadlocked over the issue of the Irish border backstop – with just five months until departure day next March.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The challenge of Britain is that opportunity isn\u0027t. That\u0027s what we have got to fix.Good morning, and welcome to The Independent\u0027s live coverage of the Budget 2018. We will be bringing you updates throughout the day as chancellor Philip Hammond delivers the last budget before Britain is due to leave the European Union in March next year.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The spokesman said:\u0026nbspWhat the Chancellor said yesterday was that he would use the fiscal reserves that we have built up through hard work and sound economic management to ensure that Britain will succeed whatever the circumstances.The Chancellor has spoken on numerous occasions about having maintained what he would describe as \u0027fiscal firepower\u0027 which he will be able to use in the event of a no-deal scenario.He added: What the Chancellor was pointing out in relation to a budget was that if economic circumstances change, he would consider economic interventions. That\u0027s what you would expect any sensible Chancellor to do.With just a little over a month left until the EU\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoultimate deadline for a Brexit deal, more money for contingency plans will be the strongest signal yet that Britain is ready to quit without a withdrawal agreement in place.Mr Hammond\u0026rsquos announcement on Monday will be the last Budget before Brexit and comes a year after he surprised Tory MPs by pledging an extra \u0026pound3billion for contingency planning on top of \u0026pound700million previously earmarked by the Government.READ MORE: Follow today\u0027s latest Brexit news with Express\u0027s live blog                NO EXTENSION!

Recently, one of my teenage daughter’s friends died suddenly when she was run over roadside after getting out of a cab.“Her face was bruised and swollen but her mum wanted to see her. I cried for hours over her body – she was just  - but how could I refuse  I brushed her hair as I would my daughters.”Despite these sad moments, Debbie says her job is her passion, and she always makes light conversation with her customers as she works on them.Make-up for funerals is usually only needed for an open casket or when relatives have requested to see the body at a funeral home.By this stage, the embalming process - a treatment in which the body is preserved via injection with a chemical solution - has been completed, so the body’s eyes are shut and their mouth has been stitched closed.“I will always talk to the bodies, she says. I tell them what I’m doing as I go along, andthey have very evident injuries, like broken bones or tell-tale signs of illness like discoloured skin, I just say: I’m so sorry you had to go through this.“I have used embalming packs on faces, where the death has been particularly violent, or an illness has altered their facial features in drastic ways. It’s just like a face pack I leave on overnight and plumps up their skin.”Debbie’s job also involves dressing the bodies with items of clothing family have brought in.“About a month ago, I had two ladies, one of  and one of , both whom had young children, she says.They had both died of cancer and I put a special wig on one of them, and the other had requested she was buried in her wedding dress.As her job can often be very upsetting, Debbie says a pinch of dark humour is sometimes needed, too.“Sometimes I’ll get myself into a real pickle. The family will send in clothes that are far too small or large and I’ll have to cut bits and bobs here and there. Sometimes outfits, like mini-skirts, are just not appropriate for a dead body,” she says.“Once a family also requested that their loved-one wore fake eyelashes. In le she had used the same pair about  times so I stood there for ages just trying to glue them on.”She adds: “There are also the times where bodies move at the funeral home. It’s not quite like it sounds, but they do groan as they release gas so it’s just a little movement.”John Harris grew up around dead bodies and has worked as a funeral home director for as far back as he can remember.His great-grandfather founded T. Cribb in , and the company has now established a reputation for their effective embalming. This is the process of flushing a body with preservative chemicals, including formaldehyde, which stops the body from decomposing.The mouth is then sewn shut and eyelids are secured with caps – thick lense-like layers that stop your eyes from appearing shrunken.John says certain formulas for embalming fluid are as coveted as the Coca Cola recipe, with some embalmed bodies lasting for over two years without decaying.“We’ve made a name for ourselves because we can keep bodies for a long time in, for want of a better term, good condition, John says. Older formulas often made the body look very waxy and made them very stf. Bodies now are very natural to touch.John explains: “The fluid itself tends to be marked with a rose tinted colour, leaving the effect of a natural skin-tone in the deceased.“Very often, when somebody has died from a long-term illness or through an accident and families have watched their relatives go through and deteriorate – the embalming process makes them look much more like they did before.“The easiest way to describe embalming is like a blood transfusion. The fastest parts to discolour on the body are where blood flowed.“When somebody dies, the blood reaches the lowest point. Sosomebody’s face is laying to one side, that side of the face will be purple.“So the idea is to use the arteries system of the body and flush everything out. It can take anything from an hour to several days, depending on the condition of the body.”Johns company preserves corpses from all over the world, including Ghana, where he has one of his many funeral parlours. Here, bodies are often kept for months, and it isn’t unusual for relatives to ask for the body to be placed in the deceased’s favourite chair at home, so the family can pay their last respects.“We once had a lady who sold roasted sweetcorn on the side of the road, John says. After she died, we prepared her body to sit in the exact position next to her sweetcorn-roaster, so locals could see her just as they remember.However, the old joke about funeral workers always being in business isnt going to hold true forever.Now funerals can be so direct, John says. You can send someone a body and a cheque and they’ll send you back a pot of ashes.“I once spoke to a man whose mother died and he told me: Don’t do the funeral on a Monday, Wednesday or Friday, because I play tennis. That epitomises how le is now and the attitude to funerals – whatever is the most convenient.”Planning to go to university to study performing arts, le changed for Ellie Carr when she was offered a position at a funeral directors aged , and she has never looked back.Now a funeral director at A.W.Lymn in Nottingham, Ellie says: “My mum is a palliative care nurse so death has never been a taboo in our family.“I would find watching people suffer very distressing, but I love what I do. There is more control in helping people after death, and being there for their families.”Ellie says the stereotype of funeral directors as the Morticia Addams-type, with long-black hair and an obsession with all things death couldn’t be further from the truth.“It’s actually much more about helping people, there is a very old-fashioned view on the job sometimes,” she says.“There’s a lot more personalisation around funerals now. There are balloon releases, colourful clothing, and funeral favours are becoming popular.“They can be chocolate, or something like memory seeds – it’s a really nice touch.”“Making the experience so personal is something I take great pride in. I just treat people how I would like to be treated.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He will be ever so happy.When it comes out he will enjoy it. Guaranteed hell watch it, he wouldnt be able to not too. Hell have his little crew in the TV room, wont he “It prolongs the pain of the families - it will never leave them, but he’ll just keep picking the scab off the deep cut, and pouring a little bit of salt in it all the time.”Today, Joe is confident and bubbly, chatting over a cup of tea in a unicorn mug. But shell never be able to forget the campaign of abuse she endured at the hands of cruel Bellfield, who used to brag about raping other women while he was with her.I have a few questions I’d like to ask him, she says. What actual pleasure did he get out of it all ”Joe adds: “I told the police in an interview I did that I’d get back with him tomorrow - because he’d have the best meal, the best day, the best sex, and I’d slit the c***’s throat as he slept and put an end to all of it, because it’s all of us lot paying for him to live his le of luxury.”And she still stands by this sentiment, adding: The victims haven’t got that, so why should he be allowed to be a fat f**k in prison Joe initially met Bellfield in  when she was  and regularly went to a bar in Twickenham, called Rockys, where he worked as a doorman. But it wasn’t until some years later, in , that they began dating - and another decade would pass before Bellfields true depravity was revealed to the world. Bellfields first victim would turn out to be Milly Dowler, who went missing from Walton-Upon-Thames on her way home from school in .Her body was found six months later, dumped in a wood in Yateley Heath, in a horric case that went unsolved for nine years, with Bellfield eventually convicted in .Then in  Marsha McDonnell was hit over the head with a blunt instrument after she got off the bus near her home in Hampton, London, and in August  French student Amelie Delagrange was found battered to death in the street in Twickenham.Joe, who is now a horse groomer, can still remember in vivid detail the start of her horrying relationship with the hulking killer.  says: “He was huge. He was a big bloke. I didnt fancy him at first, but he was a proper ladies’ man - everyone knew that.“Then my dad died, and I was in a vulnerable place. He kept on askingI wanted to go for a drink and a meal, and in the end I did.“He stayed that night, and never left.”At the start of their relationship, there weren’t any signs Bellfield was evil. She says: “He’d turn up with flowers and was a gentleman. When he wasn’t psychotic, you couldn’t want for a better boyfriend.”However, almost immediately after Joe fell pregnant with their daughter Bellfield turned aggressive.Joe says: He started with the odd slap. He came home annoyed one night - there was no reason, it was out of the blue.“I was shocked, but my hormones were all over the place and I was still upset about my dad.“I believed him when he said it was because he loved me and he was jealous.“He was convinced Id been having affairs even though I hadnt even left the house - and he couldn’t help it and he was really sorry.”From there the abuse got worse, and by the time Joe fell pregnant with her son in , daily le had become hell.Joe says: “One time he came home from work and I answered him back and he went mental – punching, biting, kicking, pinching.“Towards the end of the relationship he’d use weapons. He hit me with a rubber mallet, he’d burn me with cigarettes - he’d bruise and cut me but it was always from the neck down.And the torment didnt end there, with rapist Bellfield frequently forcing himself on her at any hour of the day.It didnt matter where we were -he wanted it, he took it, she says. You didn’t argue. You could fight but you’d always lose. It could be weekly, daily - over that period it was over  times.“He’d call me fat, stupid, say how useless I was as a mum, that I had no friends. You start to believe it.” Le became a vicious cycle of control. She says: “He was brilliant when my daughter was born. Hed always have time for the kids, and they were always well-dressed. This is why I don’t understand how he can take other people’s children away from them, because as a father he was very good.“Even after he beat the s**t out of you he’d still buy you things – sovereign rings, Kickers shoes, take you on holiday, clothes, stuff for the horses. Sometimes he’d say he was sorry but he would then start to say it was your fault. It was like he had multiple personalities.“They make you believe you’re a piece of s**t on the floor.“When people say why didn’t you walk away the first time  Until you’re in this situation and you’re living that le, you can’t know what it’s like.“I was just target practice. He was just warming up.”Bellfield – who has converted to Islam now and goes by the name Yusuf Rahim while in HMP Frankland – regularly bragged about raping girls when he ed from work as a doorman, according to Joe. But without evidence, she was too scared to say anything.Joe says: “I knew about a lot of the rapes. He’d come home bragging about it, but when I was in that position with two kids, what could I do  I’ve got to live with the guilt every day knowing potentially I could have stopped him, but there was never enough people to come forward.Imagine knowing what he is, and what he’s like - he gets arrested, gets questioned and gets let out - who’s going to get it  I fought for my le everyday - I was terried for my own le.“He bragged about raping a disabled girl on the bonnet of the car in the car park of a club. There were doormen who were there that knew, and nothing was ever done about it.Joe eventually split from Bellfield after he beat her up while heavily pregnant with their son, who was born in . She sought an injunction but Bellfield ignored it.Despite moving on with another girlfriend, Bellfield continued to terrorise Joe for years – while going on to commit multiple murders over a three year period. And it was Joe who finally exacted revenge on her evil ex by helping to bring him to justice.Joe got in touch with police after spotting Bellfield’s car on a Crimewatch programme about the attempted murder of schoolgirl Kate Sheedy in .The -year-old had been hit by a white people carrier Joe recognised as Levi’s, reversed over, and left for dead.With the help of Joe’s statements, Bellfield was convicted in  and given a full le sentence for the murder of Marsha and Amelie, and the attempted murder of Kate. He was later given the same sentence in , when he was found guilty of murdering -year-old Milly Dowler.Recalling the time that she saw his car on Crimewatch, Joe says: I was still in touch with Levi, but no longer felt scared of him. Hed moved on, he wasnt living with me anymore and I had more freedom so it was totally dferent. I called the police anonymously and told them that white people carrier had been on my driveway a couple of weeks before and it was my baby father’s car. However nothing was done at that point.“I can tell you nearly all his cars – the reg, the colour – because he stalked my le daily for  years, and would be in dferent cars all the time. You were always aware of him being around. Later that year Joe went to the police again, after the murder of Amelie.“I went into the incident room on Twickenham Green and told them Levi was a wheel clamper, had a white van and hated blondes.”Joe came face-to-face with Bellfield once again while giving evidence at Milly Dowler’s court without a screen. She says: “The last time I saw him was at the Old Bailey, and he stared back at me, he was so p***ed off.“I had photos showing hed been to Yateley horse show - the same area Millys body was found.”Today, Joe is eager to put her old le as far behind her as much as she can. She has created a new le and has been in a new relationship for nine months.“My son initially wanted to go and see Levi in prison when he was about ten, she says. I wasn’t happy about it but thankfully he changed his mind. It’s not my place to stop them seeing himthey want to.”She spends most of her time travelling for work or looking after her kids, her elderly mum and five horses, but she’s still scared by the psychological torment she suffered.She says: “I still don’t trust any guy. The minute they tell you they’ll never hurt you or cheat on you, they’re gone.“I’ve had one serious relationship since I’ve split up with him. Some friends laugh and call me ‘man hater’, but why should you trust when you’ve been through that “There’ll be god knows how many things he’s done that the police don’t know about and they’ll never know about.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I’m happy to tell Sun on Sunday readers that their hard work is paying off.Our jobs market has defied many of the naysayers.Near record numbers of people have a job and unemployment has fallen in every region across the country.There are more than .million additional people in work since .While this is a huge achievement, sometimes it’s easy to forget that behind these numbers are thousands of people up and down our country who are now better able to provide for their families.They can get up every morning knowing they have the security that only a job can bring.And what’s more, they are being rewarded with a pay rise — this month’s figures show the strongest wage growth in almost a decade.Contrary to myths peddled by the opposition, it’s people at the bottom of the pay scale who have benefited most.The lowest earners working full-time have seen the fastest rise in pay thanks to our National Living Wage and the proportion of low-paid jobs is at a record low.Tomorrow I will deliver my Budget, where I will show how our careful focus on fixing the economy is bearing fruit.Thanks to the balanced approach we have taken — getting our debt falling, while keeping taxes low — and the hard work of the people of the UK, I will be able to set out how we will be investing in our future.Much of the talk surrounding Budgets is often technical. Many, many experts and commentators will have their own take on how the economy is doing.While this is, of course, important, what most ordinary people really care about is how the Budget will improve their day-to-day lives.And one of the issues which I know Sun on Sunday readers care a lot about is transport. With a thousand more people moving into work every day, it’s important that we help to get them there on time.Many of you preparing to start the working week tomorrow will know the frustration of having your journey to work ruined by delays caused by poorly maintained roads. Or of having your car or van damaged by potholes.This isn’t just a bad way to start the day, it’s bad for businesses large and small, and it can be really damaging to the wider economy as well.It’s estimated that congestion costs UK households more than £billion every year. That’s why tomorrow I will announce a bumper £billion investment in our country’s transport network — including a new £.billion fund ring-fencing vehicle excise duty raised in England for spending on our roads.As a former Transport Secretary, I know that these are the arteries that keep our country alive – and they need taking care of. Thirty-two years ago tomorrow, Margaret Thatcher officially opened the final stretch of the M.While few would claim to love this motorway, it’s easy to forget what a landmark moment this was for our country’s transport infrastructure. Three decades later, I am committed to honouring that legacy.And as important as our major roads are, smaller local roads are just as vital to our everyday lives.That’s why I will also announce tomorrow £million of immediate cash for councils to maintain and improve local roads — fixing potholes, repairing damaged roads and keeping bridges safe and open.A further £million on top of that will help improve local junctions, allowing better access to workplaces, high streets and other community facilities.This is also part of our commitment to bridging the gap between our regions. Those in rural parts of the country should have the same chances to get on in le and not have poor transport connections limiting their potential.The funding will help make journeys quicker and easier, while boosting productivity and improving access.And because I know that not everyone drives, I will also invest in local transport projects which could include new bus, tram and cycling routes.And I will also look to the future by investing in next-generation methods of transport, which could potentially include self-driving shuttle services.Not only could this revolutionise our transport network, it will also help us become a global leader developing future technologies.And finally, as I earlier announced with the Prime Minister, I am happy to confirm we will also be freezing fuel duty, for the ninth year in a row.This will keep the cost of fuel down for millions of drivers across the UK — saving people around £million this year alone.These measures are only possible due to our careful management of the economy over the past few years — and the hard work of the British people.This country has a bright future ahead, and — thanks to this vital investment package — the journey there just got a bit smoother.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It shows the strength and resilience of the UK economy alongside the efforts and hard work of families and households up and down the country.In conventional times voters might rightly expect the result of this to be lower taxes , more investment in our public services or to see progress in us paying off the ever ballooning national debt.Instead the Government is preparing to blow this cash - your money - by giving into even more of the EU’s demands.Until last week, Britain expected a  month “transition” or “implementation” period after we formally leave the EU next year on March , .Then, late last week the Government shocked everyone by proposing that we stay in the EU longer than we were originally told and that we extend the so called ‘negotiating period’ to leave the EU.Worse still, on Monday in the House of Commons, we were told that this transition period might last until June  – that’s six years after the referendum result. Whatever happened to Brexit means Brexit On top of our extended membership of the EU, we can expect a bill from the EU! That’s right more of your money with an extra price tag of approximately £ billion each year in contributions to the EU.The Treasury has budgeted for this until the end of  but for each year after , the cost will be as high as £ billion because we will have lost the £. billion a year rebate which was famously secured and successfully negotiated in  by Margaret Thatcher when she demanded our money back from the EU.The British people are once again being treated like fools. What we are now witnessing is a blatant attempt to keep Britain in the EU while Brussels continues to raid the pockets of British taxpayers.This must end and the Government should invoke the great Thatcherite spirit of Fontainebleau and say No, No, No to Brussels. Because pumping our money into an undemocratic and unaccountable system two years after Britain voted to leave the EU is simply not right or acceptable. It makes a mockery of our democracy and is an insult to the British public.It is our money and that money should be handed back to the people and communities across the UK to invest in our domestic priorities.It could help people across Britain– especially the least well off – by giving them back more of the money that they earn by cutting their taxes.For example,we cut the basic rate of income tax by a penny, that would cost us £ billion.By increasing the personal allowance by a £,, many more of the poorest paid households would be taken out of tax altogether, that’d cost us £. billion. Andwe cut beer and cider duty by  pence, that would cost us £. billion.So by easing the tax burden for the lowest paid and doing our bit to save British pubs from closing, we’d have invested £ billion into longer term economic growth in our economy.And with the other £ billion  How about supporting the millions of families who want to own their own home by cutting stamp duty for homeowners, we can again help the least well off and give them a hand up and support them in their aspirations to own their home.We could also take more first time buyers out of paying stamp duty altogether  If we raised the starting threshold of £, to £,, this would cost the Treasury £. billion.Then there’s the VAT we pay on domestic gas and electricity. The  per cent VAT charge on domestic fuel and power raised around £. billion in  . If we got rid of this we would make fuel cheaper and families would have a little extra left over in their monthly pay packets.What about the VAT charged on sanitary products for women  This should end now and not when we leave the EU s the Government previously promised, especially as leaving the EU will take longer than we were previously promised. VAT receipts from the sale of sanitary products costs approximately £. billion a year but importantly this one VAT cut that would unite women across the country.I could go on. There are so many important domestic key services and priorities to invest in.To govern is to choose and the choice being made our Government is to spend your money on an expensive and everlasting EU membership.And all this comes on top of the ridiculous capitulation where we have agreed to the EU’s demands to hand over a £ billion pay cheque for absolutely nothing in .Britain needs once again to have a long term economic plan that puts our national interest first.Let’s start standing up for Britain by investing in people, businesses and communities rather than the unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats of the European Union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I have to take a balanced approach.The Sun revealed earlier this month that we could have a Spring Statement next year to make emergency decisionsthere wasnt a deal.Mr Hammond has promised a double idendBritain gets a deal with the EU. It would mean he doesnt have to spend money on planning for No Deal, and believes that a deal would boost the economic predictions.But the Treasury believe a no deal Brexit will require an extra £ billion more borrowing.If there was a No Deal Brexit he has got fiscal reserves that would enable me to intervene he added.Brexit talks are still at deadlock over the Northern Irish border and officials are still working on a solution.Mr Hammond said he was very confident that there would be a deal, and No Deal was extremely unlikely.And he was going along with the Office for Budget Responsibilitys predictions that we would secure an agreement.Tomorrows Budget will see Mr Hammond announce record £billion in funding to fix potholes on Britains crumbling roads, and new no-interest loans for Brits on poor incomes to tempt them away from pay-day loans.He used an interview with the Sundayto hint at a cash boost for the defence budget, tax on web giants, and pumping millions more into superfast broadband across remote areas of the country.It’s the network infrastructure that will make this country work, he added.But reports say he is only turning on the spending taps to try and save him his job in a post-Brexit reshuffle.A close ally of Hammond told The Sunday Times: “The issue is that while she thinks spending is key to survival, he knows it isn’t.

a condition that causes tissue, such as part of the intestine, to protrude through a weak spot in the abdominal wall.The hernia can cause a bulge and pain around the pubic bone.The teen was due to have surgery to repair the hernia, but it was postponed due to school commitments.Testicular torsion occurs when a testicle rotates, twisting the spermatic cord that brings blood to the scrotum.The reduced blood flow causes sudden and often severe pain and swelling.Testicular torsion is most common between ages  and , but it can occur at any age, even before birth.Testicular torsion usually requires emergency surgery.If treated quickly, the testicle can usually be saved.But when blood flow has been cut off for too long, a testicle might become so badly damaged that it has to be removed.Symptoms:Cause:It is not clear why it occurs.Most males who get testicular torsion have an inherited trait that allows the testicle to rotate freely inside the scrotum.Testicular torsion often occurs several hours after vigorous activity, a minor injury to the testicles or sleep.Cold temperature or rapid growth of the testicle during puberty also might play a role.Complications:When it is not treated it can cause damage or death to the testicle due to blocked blood flow.In some cases it can cause infertility.As the testicle is the organ responsible for producing sperm, any damage to them can impact a mans ability to have children.Source: Mayo ClinicBut during his wait for surgery the hernia began to cut off blood supply to his balls and his right testicle twisted  degrees - thats three quarters of the way around.Testicular torsion is common in teens aged between  and , andits not caught early can result in the testicle needing to be amputated.Doctors at Dayton Childrens Hospital in Ohio, US, noticed a visible bulge in his groin and his testicle was exquisitely painful to touch, according to the British Medical Journal case report.Medics were able to untwist the boys testicle with their hands after making an incision on the right-hand side of his scrotum.His hernia required surgery.The teenager recovered well and was discharged the following day.Our patient presented with worsening groin pain and a pre-existing diagnosis of an omentum-containing right inguinal hernia [a hernia that folds into the peritoneum], Dr Arturo Aranda wrote in the case report.The most obvious assessment was that this hernia had become incarcerated [trapped in the abdominal wall].Yet on physical examination, his high-riding testicle and exquisite tenderness prompted a more thorough investigation with ultrasound that confirmed decreased blood flow to the testicle.Early diagnosis can potentially be the dference between saving the testicle or its loss.Ultrasound should be performed early so that manual reduction can be attempted prior to surgical intervention.In our case, this provided immediate relief for the patient, and an intra-operative discovery of a  degree torsion, which is in a range correlative with testicular salvage.Had we successfully reduced our patients’ inguinal hernia in the emergency department, a  sense of security could have easily delayed our operative intervention until morning.Because of clinical suspicion and a testicular ultrasound, we knew that delay was not an option. This further supports the recommendation that all patients with inguinal and testicular pain should undergo ultrasound before any decision to delay surgery is made."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000445324299.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"angela merkel election germany hesse bavaria","story":"The German Chancellor has faced calls from within her own Christian Democratic Partyto give up the leadership following painful losses in a regional election.Merkel will give up the leadership of her party but remain as Chancellor, according to reports in Germany.Her predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, stepped down as leader of his party in  but remained chancellor.Merkel has led the CDU since  and has been Germanys leader since .In the past she has firmly stated that Chancellor should also be a party leader but todays events appear to indicate a change of heart.The CDU is due to hold a conference in December at which the partys leadership is up for renewal.Her party came first in yesterdays election in the western state of Hesse but support fell by more than  points.The embattled -year-old is also having to contend with pressure from her Social Democratjunior coalition partners, who have bled support in Hesse and are under pressure to rethink their alliance with Merkel.Standing down from the party chair would allow a new CDU chairman or woman to build a profile before the next national election, due in .Merkels favoured successor is CDU party secretary general Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.Merkels coalition was twice on the brink of collapse, once over immigration policy and then over a dispute about the fate of the domestic intelligence chief who was accused of harbouring far-right views.The instability has further eroded the credibility of the conservatives and the SPD in the eyes of Germans.She currently governs Germany in a grand coalition of what traditionally have been the countrys biggest parties the CDU, its Baia-only sister, the Christian Social Union, and the Social Democrats.Her fourth-term government took only took office in March but has become notorious for internal squabbling.Yesterdays election in the central state of Hesse saw both Merkels conservative Christian Democratic Union and the centre-left Social Democrats lose signicant ground, while there were gains for both the Greens and the far-right Alternative for Germany.Merkels party managed an unimpressive win, narrowly salvaging a majority for its regional governing coalition with the Greens.The debacle followed a battering in a state election in Baia two weeks ago for the CSU and the Social Democrats.The Social Democrats leader, Andrea Nahles, demanded Sunday a clear, binding timetable for implementing government projects before the coalition faces an already-agreed midterm review next fall.Nahles declined to comment Monday on the reports that Merkel might step down as CDU leader.

He also needs to find an extra #.bn a year in real terms to fund Mrs Mays NHS commitments.The chancellor is also under pressure from Tory backbenchers to cancel a planned increase in income tax allowancesin order to reverse cuts to Universal Credit for Britains lowest earners.But in such a fraught political environment it is unlikely that the chancellor will do very much at all this time around.Fiscally, its dficult to calculate how much the public finances will be affected by Brexit when we still dont knowthe UK will be leaving with a deal or not.Politically, Mrs May is in a very dangerous place in parliament, with both the DUP and Tory MPs threatening rebellions over Brexit.Against that backdrop, Mr Hammond will be hoping to get through the budget without incident. Ending austerity will have to wait. HEALTHPaul Kelso, health correspondentI am looking out for... what the plan is for public health and social care. The NHS is in the unfamiliar position of wondering \"how\", not \"how much\" from the budget.The government has already promised the health service a .% funding increase for the next five years, and indicated that taxes will rise to pay for it.But that only covers core NHS spending, and so the chancellors speech will be watched closely for information on other crucial areas, including public health budgets and social care.Both of those are currently in the gt of local government, but without investment in them, demand for NHS services will continue apace.NHS executives are currently working on a long-term plan, outlining what the public can expect from the health service.It is effectively a justication for the tax increase the chancellor will announce in the budget, but we wont see it for several weeks afterwards.Given the ambition of delivering improved cancer and mental health treatment, it is likely compromises will be required in areas including non-urgent care. ECONOMYEd Conway, economics editorI am looking out for...the chancellor manages to break out of the restraints imposed on him.Ever since the era of Gordon Brown, the chancellor has had two big annual opportunities to deliver major changes to the UK economy.When he came into office, Philip Hammond changed that: as well as shting the budget from the spring into the autumn, he proclaimed that from now on there would only be a single major fiscal event every year. One change to sht the needle every  months.The great irony is that now Mr Hammonds single shot has come around, he is so penned in that there is not all that much he can do.The biggest elephant in the room is Brexit. We are still days, week, possibly months away from having a deal on Brexit - and until that is determined, there is little point in the chancellor making major fiscal plans.The second issue is that without a majority, the government has little scope to introduce radical policies. The final constraint is that the prime minister has also laid down some crucial red lines.In her party conference speech earlier this month, Mrs May promised to end austerity. She has also committed to considerable extra spending on the NHS.Those two commitments mean Mr Hammond has little leeway. Happily, tax receipts have come in much stronger than expected in recent months, so he no longer needs to raise taxes considerably to fulfil those aims.The budget will be a steady-as-she-goes affair. A survival budget."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/10/2048x1152/skynews-leicester-srivaddhanaprabha_4467914.jpg?20181028141429 ","title":"why leicester loved vichai srivaddhanaprabha","story":"A key component of that incredible victory was the backing of their owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, the Thai billionaire who has died after his helicopter crashed outside the clubs King Power Stadium on Saturday night.His money and support of the team and then manager Claudio Ranieri was a key factor in Leicester achieving a feat which many had previously deemed impossible.

Merkels coalition was twice on the brink of collapse, once over immigration policy and then over a dispute about the fate of the domestic intelligence chief who was accused of harbouring far-right views.  The instability has further eroded the credibility of the conservatives and the SPD in the eyes of German voters, who are increasingly turning to smaller parties on the right and on the left.

Chancellor Philip Hammond claims his statement today will show your hard work is paying off as he turns on spending taps for roads, high streets and fuel. But he faces furious demands to go further by pumping more money into the Universal Credit benefit. And hes admitted he wont fulfil Theresa Mays pledge to end austerity - instead only doing it next year,theres a Brexit deal. If there isnt a Brexit deal, he said the entire Budget will have to be done again. Although, confusingly, Downing Street then insisted todays commitments will be funded irrespective of a Brexit deal.  Meanwhile the PM piled more pressure on his balance sheet by announcing an extension of a freeze on fuel duty and lting the cap on council borrowing to build new homes. Heres everything we know that is in the Budget so far - and how itll hit you.  A statement made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on his plans for tax, public spending and economic forecasts. MPs vote on whether to accept it. It would be incredibly seriousthe Budget did not pass, and could lead to a vote of no confidence in the government. Traditionally the governing party has gone to all sorts of s to persuade MPs to vote for the Finance Bill. Theresa May doesnt have a majority. And Northern Irelands DUP, who prop up the Tories, may flex their muscles and threaten to torpedo the vote.  The  Budget will take place at .pm this afternoon. Its claimed the Chancellor initially wanted the Budget to be on Wednesday  October - but thought holding it on Halloween might not bode well. How can I watch the Budget  The Budget will be screened on live news channels and Mirror, where you can watch a live feed with rolling text analysis here. Isnt the Budget in the spring   It used to be, but in  Chancellor Philip Hammond moved the Budget from Spring to Autumn. This new system replaces the Autumn Statement, which moved to become a Spring Statement , a lower-key affair. How will Brexit affect the Budget   The Budget is taking place before Britain knows for sureit has a Brexit deal - and before MPs get a chance to vote on that deal. If there is a No Deal Brexit, frankly wed need to have a new budget that set out a dferent strategy for the future, Philip Hammond admitted.  Its the only time a minister is allowed to quaff alcohol at the Commons despatch box. But given hes nicknamed Eeyore and compared to an accountant, dont expect Philip Hammond to be swigging the Special Brew. In fact, the last Chancellor to enjoy a tipple at the despatch box was Kenneth Clarke in . CONFIRMED policies in the Budget  The state of the nation - and MORE spending  The Budget will begin with major projections on GDP, borrowing and debt. These frame every decision because they show how much money there is to spend. And the Chancellor has claimed there WILL be more money to spend. Borrowing has come in lower than we expected, Philip Hammond told the BBC. Public finances are performing strongly. And he told Sky News: We are now at a turning point. Our debt is falling. The public finances are performing better and people now want to know that there is a little bit of relief coming down the line. The Financial Times has reported therell be a surprise “pound billion annual windfall” in the budget, which will help avoid hiking taxes to pay for Theresa Mays pledge to plough an extra pound billion a year into the NHS by . poundbillion a year extra for mental health  Spending on mental health will rise by at least pound billion a year by , in a push to improve access to rapid care for people in crisis. The announcements will include more specialist mental health ambulance services and comprehensive support in every major AE department. And Mr Hammond will promise improved access to services in the community, including ‘crisis cafes’ - community spaces for people to access support without going to AE. A new NHS work placement and support scheme will help , adults suffering severe mental health issues into work, the Treasury says.  The Budget will pave the way for offering no-interest loans to the three million poor borrowers who use payday lenders. Banks and debt charities will get poundmillion to help them design no-cost repayment plans for les unexpected costs. Meanwhile there will be detailed proposals to increase the breathing space for debt-ridden families from six weeks to  days. That means they would get two months before bailfs can take action. The changes were welcomed by MoneySavingExpert founder Martin Lewis, but he said the only disappointment was the y timetable - with no concrete policy announced yet. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell added: This is farcical from a Government that has overseen the expansion of high-cost problem credit on an industrial scale. And whose flagship social security policy, Universal Credit, is driving low-income households into debt.  Philip Hammond is to announce a pound.billion mega boost for our dying high streets in a major victory for the Daily Mirror. Our High Street Fightback campaign has urged the Government to take urgent action to save our traditional high street shops and local businesses with tens of thousands of jobs being lost every year. Now the Chancellor is set to use his Budget to announce a triple whammy of measures for high streets. He will slash business rate bills by a third in a poundmillion boost for almost half a million small retailers. And he is to launch a poundmillion infrastructure and transport fund to transform high streets to help them remain firmly at the heart of communities. Mr Hammond will also announce that town planning laws are to be relaxed to help support mixed business models.  Major roads will be able to access a pound.bn fund from  to , the Chancellor will claim - eclipsing the pound.bn in the previous five years. It will be funded by deciding for the first time that road taxmust be dedicated in full to roads. The money will be split into the standard Roads Investment Strategy  , plus pound.bn for major local routes. Meanwhile there will also be a poundm pothole-filling fund for councils, who have spent years warning drastic Tory cuts leave them doing the bare mininum. Some poundm will go into the Transforming Cities Fund, which funds bus routes, trams and cycle lanes, in  . Another poundm in   and poundm in   will be spent trying to improve gridlocked local junctions. And poundm will be spent between   and   on trials of next-generation transport in three city regions to look at self-driving shuttles and electric bikes. Cheaper weddings  Wedding venues could get cheaper as more pubs and restaurants open their doors in a legal shake-up promised as part of next weeks budget. Treasury officials say that red tape is stopping many smaller businesses from obtaining a licence - pushing up the costs for couples. They say relaxing the restrictions would make it cheaper and simpler for couples to get married, potentially supporting more people to get married. Surveys show the average wedding costs between pound, and pound,, which includes an average cost of around pound, for venue hire. The Chancellor is set to announce a review of marriage law in Mondays budget when he is expected to say he wants to make the outdated rules around wedding venues simpler and fairer, and reduce red tape. He is expected to say this will reduce costs for couple who want to tie the knot.  The Budget will freeze fuel duty for the ninth year in a row - a tax cut that her Chancellor Philip Hammond admits will come at signicant cost to the nation. It will benefit hard-pressed motorists but comes as other groups continue to struggle - with working-age benefits still frozen for four years to . Tory officials suggest the average motorist has gained about pound, in total from all the freezes since . Now compare that to the utterly astronomical cost. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates the cumulative effect of all those freezes is now costing the Treasury poundbillion a year. Thats more than the affordable housing budget and more than DOUBLE the amount gained by the government by freezing millions of peoples benefits.  million trees!  The Chancellor will pledge to spend pound million planting an estimated  million trees across England. pound million of that figure will be spent on planting trees in cities and urban areas. The remaining pound million will be paid to landowners who plant forests on their land, buying so-called ‘carbon credits’ from them which the Government can offset against fossil fuel emissions to hit global anti-climate change targets. The budget will also approve plans for a new “Great Thames Park” in London’s Thames Estuary. More money for broadband  The Chancellor signalled he was ready to invest billions in Britains infrastructure - like superfast broadband - in an interview with The Sunday . Sometimes the easiest thing for a government to cut in the short termits under pressure is capital investment, he said. It is the spending on the skills of the next generation, the infrastructure, including the digital infrastructure, the broadband infrastructure. For the st century broadband is to roads in the th, railways in the th, and canals in the th. Its the network infrastructure that will make this country work.  Fury is mounting, including on Tory benches, about the harm caused by flagship welfare shake-up Universal Credit. Last years Budget saw pound.billion put in - but critics say it was not enough because it has, since its launch in , been bundled up with billions in austerity-driven benefit cuts. Tory Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss admitted: We are listening very carefully to what our colleagues have to say… we want this system to work. The BBC obtained leaked plans to offer higher transition payments, lower loan repayments and more help for the self-employed. These plans would cost hundreds of millions of pounds.  But crucially its thought Tory ministers are looking at smoothing the transition to people who migrate to UC - NOT helping the million new claimants who will be on it by December . Chancellor Philip Hammond told Sky News: Well we continue to look at how this process is working andwe find clf edges and dficulties, frictions in the move from the old benefits system to Universal Credit then of course will always try to smooth those out and be pragmatic about it. The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition. Philip Hammond is expected to shelve a . per cent rise in beer duty which would have put p on a pint, the Sunday Mirror reports. Its because because better than expected tax receipts have given him an extra poundbillion to play with. But a p hike on a bottle of still wine and p on sparkling is on the cards. Spirits are likely to go up p a bottle and cigarettes p a pack. More money for social care The Chancellor has been considering a cash boost of almost poundbillion for social care to ease a national crisis, the Mail on Sunday reports. More money for the Armed Forces Multiple reports suggested Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson had secured around poundm extra for the Armed Forces. A tax ultimatum to web giants - but no action yet  Philip Hammond signalled his determination to pursue a digital tax - to ensure internet giants like Facebook pay a greater share of their profits. But it might not come straight away. He told the Sunday : Were not going to just talk about this forever. Were going to have to have a timetable for moving forward and were going to have to set some deadlines. Rumours of what COULD be in the Budget An income tax rise Tax rises were widely expected in the Budget after Theresa May promised a poundbillion pot for the NHS. One idea is the Tories could tear up their election pledge to raise the threshold at which workers start paying Income Tax. Ministers pledged to raise the tax-free allowance to pound, and the p rate starting salary to pound,. The moves are currently in progress, inching forward a little each year. But delaying or scrapping further rises could save billions. A VAT raid on small businesses The Chancellor had examined plans to drag hundreds of thousands of small businesses into the VAT system, according to the Daily Mail. Currently firms only have to charge VAT their turnover tops pound, a year. Halving that threshold to pound, could raise pound.billion but hit half a million small firms. A big hit to pay rises for nurses, teachers and police Unions have mounted a furious backlash at reported plans to curb the pay of five million public sector workers. The Government had won plaudits last year after it finally bowed to pressure and axed the % pay cap. But the Chancellor was planning to plug the enormous black hole in Tory finances by banning blanket pay rises across the board for nurses, teachers and police officers, it was reported. Its said that future wage increases will instead be based on people’s performance and where they live in the country. Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, Britain’s biggest public services union, warned: “What regional pay means in practice is further attacks on the wages of NHS staff, school staff, police staff and others. A hit to fossil fuel giants The Treasury was considering hiking the climate change levy on firms’ use of fossil fuels to raise an extra pound million a year, the Sun reported. A crackdown on offshore gambling firms Tax will be hiked on offshore gambling firms in a move to raise poundbn over five years, the Financial Times reported. This would supposedly fill a tax black hole left by the widely-welcomed crackdown on crack cocaine fixed-odds betting machines. One policy that WONT be in the Budget The end of austerity  Theresa May proclaimed austerity is over in her Tory conference speech in September. But benefits remain frozen until , effectively cutting poundbillion a year from poor peoples pockets. And the IFS think tank has warned ending austerity would cost around poundbillion. Chancellor Philip Hammond admitted any so-called end of austerity would only come next year in a full spending review, not in the Budget. And he confessed a No Deal Brexit could cancel the pledge altogether. We would need to look at a dferent strategy. And frankly wed need to have a new budget that set out a dferent strategy for the future, he said.

Mum Zoe Archer knew something wasnt right with Alisha Riley after spotting the unusual behaviour. And she trusted her instincts and took the little girl to the doctors where, after tests and scans, it was confirmed Alisha had a cancerous brain tumour. Zoe, from Huyton, Merseyside, first noticed the symptom in February when her daughter was  months old. The -year-old said Alisha, who has a twin brother Jack, was crawling when she saw the youngster was tilting her head to the left She told the Liverpool Echo: It was only slightly but she did it for a few days and I just thought she may have a bit of a stf neck. She wasnt crying with it and it wasnt stuck in that position. However days later Alisha began to vomit and the mum took her to AE.  She underwent a number of tests at both Alder Hey and Whiston Hospital which came back clear. But when she continued to deteriorate Alisha was given a scan - which is when doctors dealt the devastating blow that the youngster had a brain tumour. Zoe said: I knew she wasnt right. It was like she had gone back to being a two-month-old. I had to prop up cushions around her. It was like she was dizzy. Her eyes would roll and she wasnt able to keep down anything - she would just throw up. When they said it was a tumour it felt like my heart had stopped. I just looked at Alisha and started crying. Alisha was rushed to Alder Hey where doctors told her family she had a cm by cm tumour - the size of a golf ball. The tumour was located in her posterior fossa - an area in the brain responsible for critical s such as breathing, balance, speaking and co-ordination. Doctors firstly drained the fluid in Alishas brain and days later she had to undergo a nine hour surgery to remove the tumour. Zoe said: It just all wasnt really registering with me. Doctors were telling me of the risks of surgery and that my tiny baby could die. I was trying to listen, but it just wasnt going in. Although the surgery was a success, Alisha was not recovering as fast as doctors would have hoped and another scan showed the devastating reason why.  Alisha had a cancerous grade three brain tumour called an Ependymoma - which would grow back. Zoe said: We couldnt believe it. We had been happy because the surgery had been a success and had thought - the tumour had been removed so the cancer had been removed. The family were given a number of options including radiotherapy and chemotherapy - but due to her age both treatments came with their risks. Another option was a specialist treatment called proton beam therapy in Florida. And in June the family made the decision to fly to America for  weeks - in a bid to save their daughters le. A Go Fund me page, launched by Zoes brother Lee, raised more than pound, for the family - for their costs while out there. And after  rounds of treatment this week the family were given the fantastic news that Alishas scan was clear of cancer. Zoe said: I am so proud of how she has handled everything. She just kept smiling. Doctors have said she is about a year behind with her development, but she is getting there. She is learning to crawl again and Jack and her are playing together again. He has been great with her and will get down on the floor and crawl with her to get her going. Alisha has also been helped to move around by Newle - a charity for disabled children. Newle runs the only emergency loan service for children providing urgently needed, specialist equipment within hours, and provided a specialist buggy for Alisha. Zoe added: Because of her condition Alisha can’t sit up or support her own head, so she needs a specialist buggy with extra head support and chest straps to keep her in a stable position. Without that to keep her safe we couldn’t go. Now Alisha and her twin, Jack, are getting ready to celebrate their second birthday at the end of October. Le’s definitely not been easy and Alisha will have to have another scan in January, but we are over the moon. I think every time a scan is coming up we are going to be anxious. But now I will know the symptoms to look out for.

And one of the most enjoyable parts about it is children going from house to house and having their goodie bags filled with sweets and tasty treats.But people are being urged to remember one important thing when trick or treating - and it involves pumpkins.  If there is not a pumpkin or any decorations outside a house you are about to knock on, consider that the residents do not want to be disturbed.One mum told the Huffington Post: Our rule has always been you only trick or treat at houses that are decorated so no one is intimidated, our kids only allowed to go accompanied and only in our very local area. For many taking part, trick-or-treating is a great fun activity, but for others who may not welcome numerous callers to their door, it can be a very unnerving and stressful time. It is important for youngsters taking part to keep safe and ensure they respect people who do not wish to be part of the celebrations.If someone has a No Trick or Treaters flyer in the window, or no one answers the door, it means they do not want to participate.  Be mindful of the time too. If pumpkins have been blown out, take that as a don’t knock sign. As it starts to get very dark, thats a good time to head in. A Sussex Police spokesman said: If you are celebrating Hallowe’en, please consider the elderly and more vulnerable in the community who may find having strangers call at their door a frightening and intimidating experience. If you see someone displaying a no trick or treat poster, please do not call at those homes as people do not wish to be disturbed. Just be careful who you scare on Halloween. An Essex Police spokesman added: What might seem like being fun and mischievous to some can be really quite frightening to others.  Playing practical jokes on neighbours you don’t know or throwing things at their houses because they’re not taking part in trick or treat is unacceptable. In many cases it may actually be criminal in nature. If you decide to go trick or treating please think carefully about which doors you knock on, particularlyyou know there are elderly people living there. Some safety tips for Halloween by Sussex Police: For Trick or TreatersYoung children should always be accompanied by an adult. Older children should make sure an adult knows the area they plan to visit and what time they’ll be back Stay in well-lit areas where there are plenty of houses Keep to pavements and cross roads carefullyConsider calling only at houses where you know the occupants, rather than strangers.Explain how vulnerable people can be frightened by an unexpected group calling at their door on a dark evening. Respect the privacy and wishes of people who do not want to take part in trick or treat – observe the No Trick or Treaters please posters people may display in doors or windows For residents Residents are advised to continue to be vigilant when opening the door to strangers or unexpected callers. If you feel unsafe:Don’t open your dooryou’re unsure who is there. Use your spyhole, look out of a window, and use your door chainyou do decide to open your door. Have a contact number of a close relative or good neighbour to hand by your telephone, just in case you need to phone them. If you are part of a Neighbourhood Watch scheme, let your coordinator know that you will be on your own at Halloween. If you are a coordinator, please identity people in your scheme that may be vulnerable and offer them reassurance. If you are prepared to receive Trick or Treaters, switch on your outside light and remove any trip hazards. If you set lanterns outside your front door with candles in them, make sure that they are far enough out of the way so that costumes wont accidentally be set on fire. If you are driving on the evening of the st, remember that excited children may be crossing the road unexpectedly, so slow down in residential areas and take extra care."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle prince harrys secret","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Prince Harrys secret appointments with acupuncturist to the stars to calm wedding nervesThe revelations come after claims Harrys \"volatility\" and \"hot temper\" increased in the run-up to the wedding - with him telling royal staff: \"What Meghan wants, she gets!\"ShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsMeghan and Harry outside St Georges Chapel on their wedding day \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle and Prince Harry were so stressed before their wedding day they booked appointments with an acupuncturist to the stars, its emerged. The revelations feature in a new biography by veteran royal correspondent, Robert Jobson - and come after claims Harrys volatility and hot temper increased in the run-up to the wedding. Harry reportedly raising his voice and telling royal staff: What Meghan wants, she gets! Jobson, who has written the biography now serialised in the Daily Mail, also revealed: The weeks leading up to the wedding had been far more tense for both Harry and Meghan that most people realised. In fact, they’d both felt so stressed that they’d booked a series of appointments with Ross Barr, known as ‘the acupuncturist to the stars’.  Whether these treatments had much impact on Harry is debatable. In the build-up to the wedding, says an inside source, he was ‘petulant and short-tempered’ with members of staff. Other royal revelations include details on Harry and Williams extreme mood swings and unpredictability. The princes are said to show their father Charles, , a shocking level of belligerence, according to author and veteran royal correspondent, Robert Jobson. He claims Harry, , and William, , are not afraid to challenge their father and future monarch when it comes to issues their disagree one. And William has even been known to speak firmly in his fathers face...reminiscent of his mothers hot temper which Charles had to deal with on a regular basis during their marriage.  Jobson also revealed that according to royal family insiders, the boys have quite extreme mood swings, just as Diana did with Charles often wary of Williams reactions and unable to gauge both his sons unpredictability, reports the Mail Online. Shocking details in the book discuss Harrys volatility, claiming he his prone to emotional outbursts and like his mother, tends to wear his heart on his sleeve. Other explosive revelations in the book include claims Charles admitted he knew marrying Diana was a massive mistake before walking down the aisle. The future king, , has revealed he let himself, Diana and the Royal Family down by going ahead with the doomed wedding despite his overwhelming doubts - which at one point reduced him to tears. Charles spent  years married to Diana. He proposed on February , , but Diana felt it was like a call to duty.  They wed at St Pauls Cathedral in London on July ,  and orced on August ,  - a year before the princess died . According to Jobson, alarm bells began to ring for Charles about Diana during the few meetings they had before tying the knot. He apparently realised they were not compatible when she burst into tears and would stare blankly at him when he spoke of what he had done during the day.

Anna Cornelius died in March this year, less than a year after her daughter Hannah Cornelius was killed. Four men are currently standing trial at Western Cape Court and face charges of rape and murder. In a Facebook post titled When Anna joined Hannah, the Hannah Cornelius Foundation confirmed that Anna died on Sunday, March . Her body was seen floating in shallow water by beachgoers in Scarborough, Cape Town. It said: Anna’s friends and family knew her as an amazing human being, full of light, abundant love and energy. Following her daughter, Hannah’s, death Anna founded the Hannah Cornelius Foundation in June .  It said: Anna was driven to ensure that Hannah’s legacy be remembered through her acts of goodwill, forgiveness and love. Through the Hannah Cornelius Foundation, Anna wished to support other young people to reach beyond the realities of their present circumstances and achieve their dreams through hard work, commitment and a passionate dedication to their own development. Anna was a lawyer and leaves behind her husband, magistrate Willem Cornelius, and son, Dries.  The Hannah Cornelius Foundation aims to help underprivileged children access the opportunities “Hannah had in her le” by offering‚ among other things‚ trauma counselling and help with unplanned pregnancies. Hannah Cornelius was carjacked by four men while dropping off fellow student Cheslin Marsh, , at his home in Stellenbosch, east of Cape Town, after a night out in May . Vernon Witbooi, , Geraldo Parsons, , Nashville Julius, , and Eben Van Nieberk, , face a string of charges including murder, kidnap, robbery and rape of the Stellenbosch University student.  One of the alleged attackers claimed Hannah told the gang they could have sex with herthey let her go afterwards. Parsons said he raped Ms Cornelius first, followed by Witbooi and then van Niekerk. He claims he tried to get them to release Hannah but they put her in the boot and drove her to a vineyard.  The court heard Hannah went through an “extremely painful” ordeal before she was killed. Hannah suffered severe vaginal and cervical injuries in the prolonged attack. The court heard how Parsons had plastic pearls embedded in his penis which would likely have made the sex attack more painful.Heavy bruising on her arms show she had been held down and it is believed that probably several of the gang lted the huge rock and dropped it on her head.  At an earlier hearing, it emerged that Hannahs parents were sent a letter from one of her alleged gang-rapists begging for their forgiveness. Eben van Niekerk penned the letter but claims he was told to write in by Sergeant Steven Adams. The letter was reportedly written after his arrest and before the four men first appeared in court. It was translated from Afrikaans and had a number of errors. The top of the letter says: This letter comes from Eben VNK and it was also signed and initialled.  When translated, the letter reads: Herewith I write this letter to Hennas mom and dad. I am sorry for what I did and I askthey can forgive me for what I have done… The girl was like a friend to me but the other accused, I was also scared of them and it wasnt nice to see.

However, there was a reason for this - the arrangement is a sign of protection for women, particularly those who are pregnant, in the initial meeting between iwi, the tribe, and new visitors.  Traditionally the meeting could be a moment of “war” and is an opportunity to air grievances. Barney Thomas, chief elder, explained: “We never ever put our women in that space. “We want to be inclusive but protective, and we would not want to put our women - especially the Duchess because she’s expecting - at risk.” The meeting, of course, went without a hitch, with warm wishes from both hosts and visitors, a welcoming song and, finally, food. The Duke and Duchess had travelled by helicopter to the stunning Abel Tasman national park to enjoy the hospitality of the Maori people.  The couple, who are expecting their first child in the Spring, flew over forests, valleys and clear blue waters before arriving to drizzle.They were welcomed by songs, prayers, countless traditional “hongi” greetings and a banquet of food from their new friends. The ceremony was accompanied by the blowing of a conch shell. Following their arrival, the couple and their entourage made their way along a line of around  hosts, shaking each by the hand. They also performed the gentle nose kiss.  They were then invited to sit in two rows of plastic seats opposite the iwi with their all-female royal household staff in the back row and the Duke, Duchess and their two male translators in the front. Mr Thomas gave a speech of welcome in Maori, followed by a waiata, a song, from the group. “We’ve been watching your tour and we know you don’t get much time off,” Mr Thomas said. “I wouldn’t want to be a royal. So we don’t want to put any demands on you. We want you to enjoy yourself.All we want you to do is relax.”  The Duke, , struck an upbeat tone despite the drizzly weather, which cancelled a tree-planting ceremony. He and Meghan,  stayed inside a dry marquee for tea and cake with schoolchildren. Speaking after being formally welcomed by the Manawhenua ki Mohua people, Harry shared his excitement about visiting with a baby on board. He said: “The weather forecast was a lot worse than this. This rain is a blessing on all of us.From myself and my we and our little bump, we are so grateful to be here. “We bring blessings from my grandmother the Queen and our family. “We are so grateful for your hospitality and the work you do to look after this beautul place.”  The couple also strolled along the golden-sand beachfront on the nations South Island and discussed conservation with a ranger. Harry, wearing a black puffer jacket, and Meghan, dressed in a black Seasalt coat, came across a weka, a small flightless native bird. Ranger Andrew Lamason told the pair that the creature is New Zealands version of a monkey due to its cheeky nature. Teenager Saskia Gray, a youth ambassador, said she was impressed by the Duke and Duchess. They acted very down-to-earth, and they genuinely care about the people and the land, said the -year-old. The couple later boarded their Royal New Zealand Air Force helicopter laden with gts, including a knitted blanket fit for a newborn baby.

Soon after, the Duchess, , dressed in Outland jeans and a Club Monaco coat, went back inside the cafeacute to make a touching request. She asked staff to bring out trays of cakes that she and husband Prince Harry, , hadnt eaten so they could be given to the youngsters. She really wanted all the food to be brought outside for the children. And the kids were absolutely delighted - with pictures showing them beaming with delicious-looking treats in their hands.Meghan and Harry had earlier comforted a schoolboy who became overwhelmed when he met them outside the cafeacute. Five-year-old Joe Young, who was on the end of the line of pupils, was seen rubbing his eyes as the royal visitors approached. The Duchess, who is expecting her and Harrys first child together in Spring next year, kneeled and touched Joes hand. The Duke then went in to tickle the childs stomach.  Monica Mercury, deputy principal at the school, said: Im a huge fan of Harry and I always wanted him to share his crazy le with someone and he finally found someone so Im really happy for him. Its not every day this sort of thing happens. Joe was very nervous and Harry was very nice with him too. The couple made their way down the line, with eight-year-old Max Dash giving the flowers to the Duchess. He said: I gave her the flowers and she said thank you. It was so exciting. At the start I was a bit freaked out. The children were then given the cakes - on Meghans request - as the royal entourage headed to Abel Tasman National Park.  Edith Prebble, six, who was among the pupils outside the cafeacute, was practising her curtseys before the Duke and Duchess arrived. She said: My granny sent a text to my dad saying I hope you get to curtsey. I said My name is Edith and they said its very nice to meet you. Rewa Ririnui, eight, added: The most amazing thing ever happened to me. We were told we were going to get a big surprise and they said when they come down the stairs youll get a thumbs up. And we wondered who was going to come down the stairs and I was so surprised when Harry and Meghan came down and shook our hands. We told them our names and what school we came from.  And Monica Young-Leathers, also eight, said: I begged to come up here and shake hands with Prince Harry and Meghan and surprisingly my teacher said yes. It was really exciting. During their visit to the national park, Meghan and Harry were given seats of honour as they received a traditional Maori welcome.But while the couple were both seated on the front row, the Duchess was placed several inches behind her husband and other men. However, there was a reason for this - the arrangement is a sign of protection for women, particularly those who are pregnant, in the initial meeting between iwi, the tribe, and new visitors. Traditionally the meeting could be a moment of “war” and is an opportunity to air grievances.  Barney Thomas, chief elder, explained: “We never ever put our women in that space. “We want to be inclusive but protective, and we would not want to put our women - especially the Duchess because she’s expecting - at risk.” The meeting, of course, went without a hitch, with warm wishes from both hosts and visitors, a welcoming song and, finally, food. The couple also strolled along the golden-sand beachfront on the nations South Island and discussed conservation with a ranger. They later boarded their Royal New Zealand Air Force helicopter laden with gts, including a knitted blanket fit for a newborn baby.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex travelled by helicopter to the stunning Abel Tasman national park to enjoy the hospitality of the Maori people. The royal couple were welcomed by songs, prayers, countless traditional “hongi” greetings and a banquet of food from their new friends. At the spectacular beach front on New Zealand’s South Island, they were told to take time out from their tour to relax, taking a short stroll accompanied by a ranger to tell them about the conservation projects in the park.  The Duke, speaking after being formally welcomed by the Manawhenua ki Mohua people, shared his excitement about visiting with a new baby on board despite the soggy conditions. As guests sat under a tent roof for speeches, said: “The weather forecast was a lot worse than this. This rain is a blessing on all of us. “From myself and my we and our little bump, we are so grateful to be here. “We bring blessings from my grandmother the Queen and our family. “We are so grateful for your hospitality and the work you do to look after this beautul place.”  The Duchess, who is expecting her first child in the spring, was given a seat of honour for the ceremony in line with Maori tradition, placed in the front row but several inches back from her husband and other men on either side of her.

The couple travelled to Abel Tasman by helicopter, with a  minute journey over the spectacular hills, craggy valleys, lush forests and clear blue waters of New Zealand.  In drizzling rain, they were escorted into a grass clearing by a group of women, accompanied by the melodic sound of a conch shell, before a karanga was called. The call, between two groups of women, saw the Duke and Duchess walk slowly towards the tent, under and umbrella, before being welcomed with the hongi. The couple and their entourage made their way along a line of around  hosts, shaking each by the hand and performing the gentle “nose kiss”. They were then invited to sit two rows of plastic seats opposite the iwi with their all-female royal household staff in the back row and the Duke, Duchess and their two male translators in the front.

The explosive revelations by royal correspondent Robert Jobson claim tensions were high in the run-up to the wedding, with Meghan and Harry even turning to acupuncture as a stress-buster. Now, Jobson has also revealed Harry would raise his voice on occasion, insisting Meghan had everything she asked for on the day of the wedding in May. As part of a serialisation of his book in the Daily Mail, he writes: The weeks leading up to the wedding had been far more tense for both Harry and Meghan than most people realised.  In the build-up to the wedding, says an inside source, he was ‘petulant and short-tempered’ with members of staff. Raising his voice on occasion, Harry would insist: ‘What Meghan wants, she gets. The book also details how Harry and his brother William would have extreme mood swings, with their volatility often mirroring that of their mother Diana. It says how Charles found it dficult to predict their behaviour, and how he was often shocked at the level of belligerence he encountered from his children.  Quoting a royal insider, Jobson writes: To this day, Charles admits he often finds it dficult to gauge either of his sons occasionally unpredictable moods. In that aspect of their nature, both princes are very much like their mother, one close source confirmed. A former courtier made the same analogy. They both have quite extreme mood wings, just as Diana did, he said. She could be your best friend one minute and the next, your worst enemy.

But this week I was moved to tears by an article I had no idea she was writing about her mother. Heulwen Ebsworth, a beautul, vibrant -year-old, died suddenly from a brain —aneurysm in  when her three daughters were still teenagers. “When the doctors asked us about donating my mum’s shyorgans, all I could feel was fury,” wrote Rhian, who was then just . “It was the most painful moment of my le.” Heulwen wasn’t registered as an organ donor but her shyfamily knew she would want to help others and agreed.  A few months ago Rhian shydecided to find outanyone had benefited. She discovered her mother had saved six lives, including a five-year-old boy. And that knowledge will comfort her forever. “I had no idea,” I said after reading the piece. “Well, it’s not something that comes up in conversation,” she replied. And that is why Rhian told her story. Because to help save more lives we all need to talk to our loved ones about organ donation. On Friday, MP’s voted to change the law so that adults will be shypresumed to be donors unless they expressly opt out. Max’s Law – named after ten-year-old heart transplant recipient Max Johnson, who led a Daily Mirror campaign – could save shyanother  people a year. But it has to pass through the House of Lords and won’t come into effect until spring . And because shyfamilies will still be consulted before shyorgans are removed it’s vital that our next of kin know our wishes. I’d like to donate my shyorgans when I’m gone.  But, I’m ashamed to say, I’d never got round to doing shyanything about it. Thankfully though, I was visiting my shybrother when I came across Rhian’s shyremarkable article. He and I read it together and we had a chat about our choices. Then I went online and joined the organ donor register. But Max’s Law will make it a little easier for doctors to have those shyagonising conversations. And for families, like Rhian’s to pass a beautul, vibrant le to six other people.

It has not yet issued its winter forecast. The Weather Company, the worlds biggest commercial forecaster, predicted the UK’s coldest winter for eight years, with December cold spells and extended January and February freezes.

This winter will be the coldest since -the UK’s average temperature from December to February is .C colder than winter’s .C average, Met Office records show. That would be colder than last winter – which saw the Beast from the East freeze the country and had an average temperature of .C - and winter -, which saw a month of Government health warnings as winter averaged .C.  Leon Brown, head of meteorological operations at The Weather Company’s Weather Channel arm, said: “The UK is looking at the coldest winter for eight years, since -. “After cold snaps in a mixed start to winter, we forecast the coldest periods with Arctic influence and snow in January and February.  “Low temperatures should exceed -C. Travel disruption is expected. “A strong Atlantic jet stream gives the UK a mild westerly flow with colder air trapped in the Arctic – but a weaker jet stream is forecast this winter, allowing Arctic air to drain south to the UK. “This causes much colder and longer-lasting cold periods than during a normal winter. “A colder winter is also expected due to the sun’s activity cycle approaching a ‘solar minimum,’ meaning there is less heat and energy reaching Earths atmosphere, contributing to weaker jet stream winds.”  The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “The chance of winter - being cold or very cold has increased.” A Met Office forecast said: “Temperatures end October cold or rather cold, then recover.

Ive been looking at phantom pregnancies. I believe a phantom pregnancy is a real pregnancy but you have a phantom inside of you rather than a human baby.

The young girl, named as Ksenia, is in intensive care with serious face and chest injuries. She survived the incident but doctors say she will be “scarred for le” and a medic says she has been left with a bite mark on her face spanning from her ear to her chin.  The child had been waving a small flag and the lioness rushed from its trainer despite being on a leash and sprang on the child. One account said the wild animal broke a flimsy safety netting around the circus ring at Uspenskoye village in the Krasnodar region. Valentina Pavlova said she was a member of a medical team which treated the girl at the Central Republican Hospital in Krasnodar. “There is a bite on her face that goes from ear to chin,” she said.  She added that the lioness used its paw and pulled the child inside onto the arena and sank its teeth into her head. “The circus team pulled the lioness away and delivered the girl to the Central Republican Hospital. “She is now in stable condition, there is no danger to her le.”  The child is being treated in intensive care. Wild animals continue to be used for performances in Russian circuses, including many touring troupes that go from place to place.

On the th anniversary of suffrage in the country, self-confessed feminist Meghan, honoured her hosts with a traditional Maori greeting of “tēnā koutou katoa” , meaning hello to you all. The Duchess told of her pride of being in the country that has such an important place in the history of women’s rights. She said: “The achievements of the women of New Zealand who campaigned for their right to vote, and were the first in the world to achieve it are universally admired.  “In looking forward to this very special occasion, I reflected on the importance of this achievement, but also the larger impact of what this symbolises. “Because yes - women’s suffrage is about feminism, but feminism is about fairness. “Suffrage is not simply about the right to vote but also about what that represents.  “The basic and fundamental human right of being able to participate in the choices for your future and that of your community. The involvement and voice that allows you to be a part of the very world you are a part of.” “And women’s suffrage is not simply about the right to vote for women but also about what that represents.  “The basic and fundamental human right of all people - including members of society who have been marginalised - whether for reasons of race, gender, ethnicity or orientation - to be able to participate in the choices for their future and their community. “So bravo New Zealand for championing this right  years ago - for the women who well deserve to have an active voice and acknowledged vote, and for all of the people that this effort has paved the way for globally.  “We all deeply thank you.” She ended her speech with a phrase from Kate Sheppard, who was the most prominent member of the women’s suffrage movement in New Zealand. The country’s most famous suffragette was born in Liverpool, and emigrated to New Zealand with her family in . Meghan, who looked stunning in a black Gabriela Hearstgown and a Maori inspired necklace, said: “In the words of your suffragette Kate Sheppard, “All that separates, whether race, class, creed, or sex, is inhuman, and must be overcome.”  The Duke and Duchess were invited to the residence by New Zealand’s Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, who asked them to attend thewith around  women chosen from local communities who are continuing to fight for women’s rights. The evening got off to a  start after the building had to be evacuated just moments before Meghan and Harry were due to be officially welcomed. As they were both getting ready in an upstairs room at the sprawling mansion built in , an unidentied person set off a smoke alarm in a downstairs toilet. An official later said it was believed to have been “steam or some form of atomiser”, perhaps an aerosol can, that had caused the  alarm. After a  minute delay, the Duke and Duchess were greeted first by the leader of the opposition, Simon Bridges and his we Natalie, before spending around  minutes warmly chatting to Ms Ardern, New Zealand’s third female Prime Minister.  They were welcomed my Dame Patsy Reddy, also the third woman to take up her post. Dame Reddy paid tribute to Kate Sheppard and heralded her contribution to the country’s and indeed the world’s suffrage history. She said: “Kate Sheppard is our Emmeline Pankhurst.  “Under her leadership, New Zealand women were the first in the world to achieve the right to vote –  years before the United Kingdom and  years before the United States. “Kate Sheppard and her fellow suffragists went door-to- door and town-to-town to get signatures for their monster suffrage petition. “They showed the power of women’s words to raise awareness and bring about change. “Kate was a superb communicator. “She used invincible logic in her appeals for justice, fairness and decency.  “She was an effective networker – galvanising other women into action, here and internationally.” The royals were treated to several traditional performances, including a six minute rendition from the poet laurette Dr Selina Tusitala Marsh. The Auckland-based Pacic poet and scholar receited her poem “Lead” about the concept of leadership and what it takes to achieve wellbeing in le. The celebrated high school trio Le Art also performed their song Choose Love. The schoolgirls shot to fame earlier this year when they posted an acapella version of the national anthem that received more than one million views on YouTube.

Training has been really good and I thinkyou asked any of the boys in the changing-room we’d all be the same.“It’s really gone up a level, we’re all enjoying it and I think that shows on a Saturday.“It’s been quite tough but I think we needed that. It’s been enjoyable at the same time, though, and we’re all buying into his ideas.”Off the field there seems to be an air of optimism around Tannadice but Booth knows getting results on the pitch is the only way to realise their hopes of promotion.And that means keeping their unbeaten run under the new boss going against a Dunfermline side that have already bagged a deserved win over the Tangerines.Booth added: “Four points from the first two games isn’t too bad but I think they were two good performances as well.“We feel hard done by we didn’t get the win over Inverness – I think most people there would agree with that but it wasn’t to be.“At least we put in a really positive performance and everyone is pulling in the same direction.“There is a good feel about the place and, hopefully, we can kick on now and go on a little run.“The players, coaching staff, fans all seem to be pulling in the same direction especially since the new gaffer has come in.“A thousand fans down at Partick, great backing and then same again last weekend.

of the scariest time of the year.David said: “There’s been a big push on well-known characters like Slenderman – a child- snatching monster dreamt up on internet message boards – along with killer clowns like Pennywise from the remake of It.“And with the new Halloween film out there’s been big demand for costumes of Michael Myers.“We still do a lot of ‘generic’ costumes but people like to make them scary. People are buying costumes of Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz and Little Red Riding Hood and adding blood and cuts.”Social media has given a  to budding make-up artists, who use their skills to create some truly grisly effects.For those who don’t have a make-up artist to hand, Yvonne’s has also stocked up on a iety of “kits” offering everything from cuts and scars through to more elaborate – and gory – bodily injuries.David added: “It’s usually the kids more than the adults who want to add gore, blood and guts. Even little girls and boys.“It used to be that people wanted to dress up as less scary things at Halloween but that tide has turned again.“Superhero characters like Deadpool and Harley Quinn from Suicide Square are still very popular but there’s a lot more demand for horror.”For those who do prefer their look to be more current, Yvonne’s has up-to-date costumes, including a “carry-me” one showing Donald Trump riding on the back of Kim Jong-un.For those coming in to buy their wicked wares, David added that there’s no need to be scared.“All of our staff get dressed up and slap on the make-up – it’s more fun for the customers to see us like this,” he said.“Adults can be a bit sheepish but when they see us totally involved in it they really go for it.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bd3331b01405-848x564.jpg ","title":"work on track to complete two pedestrian crossings on kingsway","story":"The second phase of work to install two new pedestrian crossings on the Kingsway is due to finish on schedule.Workers have been carrying out extensive surfacing improvements on the ide between the eastbound and westbound stretches of the carriageway between Old Glamis Road and Forfar Road.Alterations have been carried out during off-peak hours, with lane closures taking place between .pm-.am to minimise disruption.The latest phase of works has involved metal studs and markings being laid on the road surface, along with footways at the points where the Kingsway meets Graham Street and Mains Loan.A spokeswoman for Dundee City Council confirmed the latest phase of the project was due to be completed by Saturday.It is understood that further works will be required to install the traffic lights themselves along with the systems required to make them work.The local authority’s plans to install the pedestrian-operated Toucan crossings on the Kingsway are part of its wider efforts to encourage the use of sustainable transport.Funded by a grant from the Scottish Government through its Cycling, Walking and Safer Streets scheme, the crossings will link Dundee south of the Kingsway with Caird Park.The carriageway has been viewed by city planners as a “major barrier” for cyclists and pedestrians wanting to travel to the north or south of the city.Fears of disruption caused by the signals have previously been allayed by council officials, who said the lights will operate on an “on-demand” basis rather than on a timed cycle.A date for the next phase of the works is yet to be set and no further comment on the works was available from the council."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"7-iconic-halloween-costume-ideas-related-to-glasgow","story":"If youre stressing about coming up with a brilliant Halloween costume idea, then why not look for inspiration from the wonderful city we live in."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-head-of-entertainment-who-spoke-on-anniversary","story":"OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the worlds biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas -

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13470760.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_AMP_SDR_150718_TRUMP0013JPG.jpg","title":"ayrshire dad who blocked president","story":"NewsDaft dad in the dock after blocking Donald Trumps motorcade while he popped into the Co-op for milkPeter Goudie was stunned to be confronted with armed cops when he came out of the Maybole supermarket with his shopping.ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsPeter Goudie came face-to-face with armed cops when he held up the Trump motorcade when he popped into the Co-op for milk \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHe had dashed out to buy some milk from the Co-op.

And Peter Goudie, , came face to face with officers, including armed police, who were twitchy that his Volkswagen Golf was in the way.  Donald Trump had already touched down at Prestwick in Air Force One and his cavalcade was heading to Maybole, en route to a weekend of golf and talks at Turnberry. And the convoy of the most powerful president on earth wasn’t going to be impeded by a naughty parker. The astonishing tale unfolded at Ayr Justice of the Peace Court last week. Goudie’s lawyer Peter Lockhart just managed to keep his client on the road, and he left with eight penalty points on his driving licence and a pound fine. Goudie, of The Loaning, Maybole, admitted stopping on a zig-zag line at a pelican crossing, having no insurance, taking his we’s car without permission and not having a full licence.  Depute fiscal Ed Sheeran told the Justice on the bench that at around pm on Friday, July  there was a major police operation on-going on the A. He said that it was part of a management plan due to the visit of the president of the United States of America. The court was told that there was a large police presence in Maybole High Street and that they had noticed the grey Golf was stopped on the zig-zags. They found Goudie inside the shop and the offences unfolded.  Mr Lockhart told the court Goudie’s we was out and he had decided to pop down to the Co-op to get some milk. The solictior added: “My client had not noticed the high police presence. “He was alarmed when he was approached by the police in the shop and even more alarmed when he came out and saw more police, including armed police in the vicinity.” Mr Lockhart explained that it had been a costly exercise as the police had removed and impounded his car. He added: “His we was furious when she found out as it cost pound to get the car back the following day. “He was in the dog house for his stupidity.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEd SheeranVolkswagenJusticePrestwickDonald TrumpAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire vets reveal cases sedated","story":"NewsAyrshire vets reveal cases of \"sedated\" and \"drowsy\" dogs on our beachesWidespread reports of dogs falling ill have sparked panic among pet owners in the region.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsAyr beach \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailVets have been inundated with sick dogs on Ayrshires coastline, the Post can reveal.

first two children has also been attacked.And the Tory list MSPs attempt to justy the two-child cap this week was met with anger and disbelief.Ms Ballantyne told Holyrood: \"The two-child limit is about fairness.\"It is fair that people on benefit cannot have as many children as they like while people who work and pay their way and dont claim benefits have to make decisions about the number of children they can have.\"Universal Credit may have its flaws, but the thinking behind the system is sound.\"It is about making it better to be in work than not to be in work.\"MSPs were debating

However, there is precedent for splitting the two jobs.Mrs Merkelrsquos predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, stepped down as leader of his centre-left Social Democrats in  as his government struggled, but remained chancellor until he narrowly lost an election  months later.Helmut Schmidt, West Germanyrsquos chancellor from  to , never led the Social Democrats.ldquoThe CDU faces a turning point, Mike Mohring, a regional party leader from eastern Germany, told Welt television. ldquoAngela Merkel knows best what to do, and now she has decided.

Germanyrsquos nuclear power plants following Japanrsquos Fukushima disaster in .She allowed large numbers of asylum-seekers into Germany in , many fleeing the fighting in Syria, declaring that ldquowe will manage it, before gradually pivoting to a more restrictive approach.That decision has led to lasting tensions in her conservative Union bloc, particularly with the CDUrsquos Baia-only sister

The rampant home side completely outplayed the visitors who looked out of sorts and overwhelmed by the occasion.For those who witnessed the second half, what followed was one of the finest and most unlikely comebacks they will ever experience.Claremont blitzed the unsuspecting Pupils from the outset, scoring in their first attack of the match.Before a breath was drawn, a surging run and cross by Claremont’s tall centre-forward was promptly dispatched into the back of the net at the back post.It was a case of backs to the wall for the visitors who, after a number of close shaves, found themselves two behind midway through the first half.This time the damage was self-inflicted, when an innocuous cross from the left was palmed into the path of the incoming striker who scored with ease from close range.The alarm bells now ringing loudly, with  minutes of the half remaining the visitors somehow conjured a goal against the run of play.A breakout by Ryan Deans ended with a fine pass to set up Sary Rhama, whose pace and parting shot almost took the net away.The home side, however, were unrelenting in their efforts and deservedly restored a two-goal cushion with a goal just before the break.A reading of the riot act at half time appeared to have the desired effect as, after a number of changes, both positional and to personnel, the second period produced a whole new ball game.Leading the line from the front, the introduction of Cameron Wylie was the key to the comeback, his unrelenting efforts to close space soon rewarded as his team responded in kind.A quick interchange of passes between Deans and Grumoli brought its reward, leaving the latter free to curl a wonderful shot into the top corner of the net. The comeback was on.Liam Renton joined the act in the th minute of a strange match after a headed clearance met with a flush volley as a superbly struck shot thundered into the net for the equaliser.There was time aplenty for the Pupils to shoot themselves in the foot again, and Claremont regained the initiative when Fraser Wylie mistimed a clearance to send the ball into his own net.At the opposite end – possibly goal of the match.Astothe gesture, a deep free kick from Renton produced another equaliser, the home defence’s attempted clearance rebounding off a fellow team mate and into the net.So came the final moments of the game, with Cameron Wylie again involved.A crunching challenge on Wylie seemed to be an obvious free kick, but the referee waved play on.Gary Grumoli sent an inch perfect pass to the back post, for Ross Brown to score his first team goal and the Pupils# eventual, but by now, deserved winner.In a clf-hanging finish to a game that had everything, Alastair Ferguson produced a wonderful one-handed save to deflect a perfectly struck free kick to safety.Campbeltown Pupils are at home tomorrow with a pm kick off against second-placed Neilston.See posters and social media for further information.A previous celebration for Gary Grumoli and Liam Renton two stars of Saturday#s match. _cpupils_celebration"},{"url":null,"title":"letter perfect bus service","story":"Last week I went to Glasgow, travelling on the .am bus and arrived only  minutes behind schedule despite the Rest and Be Thankful road closure.I was very impressed with West Coast Motors# handling of the situation which must cause transport companies huge logistical problems.Margaret Mathieson,Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"seniors sway at tea dance soiree","story":"Senior citizens and friends were serenaded at the last tea dance of the year.Singer Robert McCallum#s golden oldies got almost everyone dancing at Saturday#s event in Campbeltown#s Lodge St John’s No .At the event organised by the Monday Social Club, guests were also treated to traditional tunes courtesy of Carradale#s Alex MacKinnon and his accordion.It wasn#t just seniors who enjoyed the afternoon, as ten-year-old Hannah Conley, who attended with her granny, Isabel, who turned  on Tuesday, was rarely off the dance floor.The icing on the cake was the copious amounts of home-baking and tea and coffee on offer, making sure everyone who danced the afternoon away remained hydrated.The event raised £ for Monday Social Club funds.For more photographs, see next week#s Courier.Ten-year-old Hannah Conley, right, danced the afternoon away with her granny#s friend Anna Viola. _cteadance"},{"url":null,"title":"young footballers learn lifesaving first aid","story":"CDJFA groups have been learning basic first aid skills, from paramedic Lorne McArthur, which could help treat sports injuries.The youngster#s training included cleaning and bandaging up wounds, supporting broken bones, dealing with concussion and some CPR and  children in total took advantage of this opportunity.Imogen Todd practices resuscitation watched by other young players.

Dennis Meenan when the Casting the Net project bus sailed into town.Mario and Marek enjoy fishing for mackerel from Campbeltown#s old pier with Marek even smoking their catches himself.Dennis, who stars in a video filmed for the project, popped into the bus, which was in Campbeltown last week, at the same time as the youngsters and told them tales about the ring-net fishing industry, which largely died out in the early s.Dennis, who fished all his le from the age of , explained that two fishing boats would be used to cast a net around a shoal of herring before pulling together to create #a purse# which traps the fish.He said the real skill was not in catching the fish, but in finding them in the first place, at a time when there was no sonar.Nature was the most common guide with gannets, which feed on herring, and basking sharks, which eat the same plankton as the fish, giving away their location.Dennis explained that a single gannet once helped him land a massive catch which filled four boats, off the Tiree coast.Casting the Net, a collaborative project between the Clyde Fishermen#s Association and the Scottish Fisheries Museum, is an oral history project capturing the memories and experiences of the last remaining Clyde ring-net fishermen.The bus, bought on eBay, has been transformed into the project#s mobile hub.Jill de Fresnes, from the Clyde Fishermen#s Association, talked to countless fishermen, including Dennis, carrying out video interviews and collecting clips, photographs and other artacts on display on the bus.Artist Deirdre Nelson transformed the interior with the help of P- pupils from Tarbert Academy, the village where ring-net fishing is said to have been born.Ms Nelson worked with the children to create cushions, a blind and upholstery with exquisite detail based on the interviews.The Scottish Fisheries Museum loaned several historic items to the project, including a needle used to repair nets.As he demonstrated the skill he said he

Whatever the shout and whatever the emergency I have to pick the best crew available for the job in hand.ldquoBut at Dunbar, every volunteer gets their chance to be involved on our shouts.Although Gary is proud to see Kieran maintaining the connection, he said there were times the job really brought home to him the importance of family.He said: ldquoSome jobs have been so rough Irsquove kept the details from my family and one job sticks in my memory because we were tasked to a boy whorsquod fallen from clfs who was the same age as Kieran.ldquoI immediately thought: lsquoThat could have been him.rsquoldquoWill it be at the back of my mind, that Irsquom potentially taking my son into a dangerous situation  Of course.ldquoIn the old days multiple family members were not permitted on shouts in case of loss, but today the boats are a lot safer and sometimes it can pay to have someone you know well alongside you.ldquoMy brother-in-law Kenny Peters was my mechanic here on many rescues ndash including the yacht episode."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-revealed-for-another-250-houses-on-the-edge-of-haddington","story":"An exhibition took place on October  where Taylor Wimpey East Scotland and Mactaggart  Mickel Homes outlined their proposals for a site west of Letham Mains, where work is already under way on more than  houses.The L-shaped scheme, which is off Pencaitland Road, would see about  homes created, with a quarter of them affordable, and would sit in the south-west corner of the Letham Mains plans.Paul Darling, from the townrsquos community council, was among more than  people who attended the event at the Maitlandfield House Hotel.He said: ldquoIrsquom not against them putting houses there ndash they are filling in the gap there. It is in the Local Development Plan as well.But Mr Darling was concerned that all of the affordable housing was being placed in one area of the site rather than spread throughout.Further concerns were aired during the exhibition about the number of houses being ldquocrammed in.As well as housing, the site would contain space for play areas, while there are plans to create a foot cycleway along the southern boundary.The event gave the homebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties. It was also an opportunity for the community to share their views and to give their feedback as the detailed designs for the development evolve over the coming months.Speaking on behalf of both developers, Pauline Mills, land and planning director for Taylor Wimpey East Scotland, said: ldquoOur public consultation event for land at Letham Holdings is an important element of our community engagement.ldquoAlong with our development partner, Mactaggart  Mickel Homes, we are pleased that so many members of the local community took the opportunity to visit our public consultation event.ldquoWe will now consider all of the views and feedback that we received as part of our overall design process."},{"url":null,"title":"no-fortnight-of-late-openings-for-east-lothian-pubs-this-christmas","story":"The traditional am extension granted by East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board for a fortnight each Christmas has been slashed to just three days over Christmas and two at New Year.The changes, which were recommended by the councilrsquos licensing forum, will see the traditional granting of am last calls allowed on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Boxing Day, Hogmanay and New Yearrsquos Day only.Last year, in line with the councilrsquos previous policy, drinking establishments were allowed a am extension from December  to January .In recommending the change to the boardrsquos licensing policy, which was under review, East Lothian Licensing Forum said: ldquoIt has been observed locally that the number of premises that took advantage of the extension beyond these proposed main holiday dates was considered to be quite small.Members of the forum attended a joint meeting with the licensing board in Haddington last month where they took the board to task for ignoring another recommendation calling for the boardrsquos new policy to continue its previous stance that the county had an overprovision of off-sales outlets.The forum is a statutory body which every board has to consult with and represents a community voice on licensing operations. Members are drawn from local residents, licensees, health professionals and police.The board, which approved its new revised licensing policy for the next five years at a meeting earlier in the morning, scrapped the overprovision statement.Forum member Elizabeth Oldcorn said the decision was ldquodisappointing and against the views of the forum and the NHS, which she represents on it.She said: ldquoI think the board has done itself a disservice.And concerns were raised that not having an overprovision statement ndash which allows the board to reject licence applications from new premises on the argument an area already has enough premises ndash left it vulnerable.Forum convenor George Hood warned: ldquoI thinkyou do not have an overprovision statement you will find it very dficult not to grant a licence.The board argued that, while there were ldquosignicant health and crime problems in our communities that should not be ignored and ldquoaccess to alcohol is a key issue, it did not believe the harm caused by alcohol in East Lothian was a ldquodirect and sole consequence of the number of premises.Councillor Jane Henderson, board member, said: ldquoWe have to be absolutely certain about the causal link.Rudi Fruzynski, the boardrsquos licensing standards officer, said that one of the issues was a lack of guidance from the Scottish Government as to what qualied as overprovision.He said: ldquoThere has not been clear guidance from the Governmentrsquos policy unit.ldquoIt does not give us the information needed to put a policy in place with confidence it will not be challenged."},{"url":null,"title":"six-new-electric-vehicle-charging-points-for-east-lothian","story":"The Department for Transportcash will create chargepoints in residential areas in Aberlady, Dunbar, Stenton, North Berwick and West Barns.East Lothian Council applied to the DfTrsquos Office of Low Emission Vehiclesfor the funds following calls from residents who wanted to invest in electric cars.The new funds will be topped-up with money from Transport Scotland.Councillor Norman Hampshire, the councilrsquos cabinet member for the environment, said: ldquoThese chargepoints will improve access for everyone in the area, not just the residents who made the initial approach.ldquoIrsquod encourage anyone with suggestions about locations for new points to get in touch.The cash comes on top of pound, funding from Transport Scotland awarded to the council this year to increase the number of electric vehicle charging points.The six locations for new electric chargepoints are: Haddington Road, Aberlady Church Car Park, Stenton Forth View, West Barns Links Road, North Berwick Dunbar Leisure Centre Car Park and Dunbar High Street Car Park."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-halloween-tale","story":"HIDDEN on the edge of Gford woods are the lonely ruins of Yester Castle. The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus. It should not just parallel other bus routes, which is what the Tesco bus does, but should serve some of the residential areas that are cut off from buses.

However, there is precedent for splitting the two jobs.Mrs Merkelrsquos predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, stepped down as leader of his centre-left Social Democrats in  as his government struggled, but remained chancellor until he narrowly lost an election  months later.Helmut Schmidt, West Germanyrsquos chancellor from  to , never led the Social Democrats.ldquoThe CDU faces a turning point, Mike Mohring, a regional party leader from eastern Germany, told Welt television. ldquoAngela Merkel knows best what to do, and now she has decided.

But there is also a fake Douglas, a counterfeit  Main Street, one that only exists online: the HQ, among other things, of a global corporation with offices in New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Copenhagen and beyond.This particular make-believe version of the draperrsquos shop has a two-storey glass and steel atrium, huge open-planned rooms and an army of hipster staff in designer glasses.It is, at least according to its own website, the Londonoffice of Falcon Business Services, an international ldquocreative advertising agency working for blue-chip clients like Starbucks, HM, Boeing, Cisco and even disgraced mogul Harvey Weinsteinrsquos now bankrupt movie-making concern.Falconrsquos internet offering may look slick ndashauthentic, it would be by far the biggest and most successful business in Scotlandrsquos under-pressure advertising sector ndash but the sitersquos gobbledygook English gives its fakery away.ldquoWe appreciate every culture, we are consist from many dferent culture from many country around the worlds, the agency boasts on its site about its ldquoLondon HQ in Douglas. ldquoThis place very big and cozy, this is our main office consist of large amount of employee across the world.How Falcon portrays its HQ, screen grab of its websiteBack at the real  Main Street, Lilli Clark bursts out laughing when she hears how Falcon describes her surroundings. Clark, with friend Sally Kerr, runs a small book-keeping practice at the old shop, including a ldquovirtual office where a Falcon Business Services is, indeed, registered.The pair find themselves on the edge of the surreal world of Scotlandrsquos notorious ldquotax haven firms: of ghost companies of here-today, gone-tomorrow anonymously owned corporate entities. That is because their address is the registered HQ of thousands of businesses, many created as global criminals exploit Britainrsquos lax and barely policed corporate transparency laws.Most are Scottish limited partnerships or SLPs, a kind of shell firm which anti-corruption campaign Transparency International describes as ldquoa vehicle of choice for money-laundering.Falcon is an SLP. There is no way of knowing who owns the business, how much money it turns over or evenit has anything to do with the website in its name.This, for Clark, is not funny. Because it means her address does not just feature on shlocky websites: it also stars in some of the worldrsquos biggest crime stories.Two years ago The Herald revealed ldquonumber  was the official home of firms at the centre of a major Ukrainian investigation in to allegedly corrupt side-payments on an arms export to the Middle East. Since then Douglas shell firms have rarely been out of the news.Clark stresses she knows nothing about any of the firms using her address. ldquoWe have no control over them whatsoever, she explains. ldquoWe want to get rid of them but we canrsquot.She sighs as she hears the latest on Douglas SLPs. That is because they number among a series of UK shell firms ndash with no identiable real world connection to Britain ndash which The Herald on Sunday has identied as being behind supposedly multi-million-dollar investments in the tyrannical Central Asian state of Uzbekistan.Just one SLP, called Quality Trade Supplies or QTS, is building a steel mill in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, for just over  million euros. This ldquoBritish investment was announced by Uzbekistanrsquos president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, with an official visit to its -hectare site, which, unlike Falconrsquos global HQ, is very real.Presidential press releaseTwo decades after the closure of Ravenscraig, a Scottish company is again investing in steel, albeit overseas. Or is it The Herald on Sunday has made multiple attempts to contact QTS, whose website says it has a representative office in Kazakhstan, as well as its official home at  Main Street, Douglas. We wanted to ask QTS who its owner was. The firm has failed to comply with new UK rules under which last year it should have named any ultimate beneficiary or PSC ndash a ldquoperson of signicant control.The firmrsquos website says the Tashkent Metallurgical Plant is a ldquostate project ndash while the state itself says it is a QTS project. The stated investment is one of the biggest carried out by a Scottish enterprise overseas in recent years.QTS on its site also said it was also building a km railway line with  stops across Kazakhstan, part of a major drive to improve transport links between China and Europe. That job, it said, would involve  construction workers. Again, this would be a nearly unprecedented venture for a Scottish firm.Uzbeks also have questions about who owns QTS. One prominent former Soviet oligarch has been named locally as being behind the firm. A London public relations firm acting on his behalf has denied any connection.Mirziyoyev has also given his official blessing ndash and visit ndash to another major ldquoBritish investment from a Douglas firm, a m cement factory in the underdeveloped western Uzbek region of Karakalpakstan.Shavkat MirziyoyevUzbekistanrsquos Ministry of Economy formally lists ldquoforeign investments in infrastructure or industry every year. These include a roll-call of SLPs with either opaque ownership or PSCs filed in the name of untraceable Uzbeks. At least five other Douglas SLPs are named in press reports or official bulletins as recent investors. None have transparent ownership or any real-world links to Lanarkshire.Uzbek authorities have also named a series of English and Welsh shell firms, mostly limited liability partnerships or LLPs, as ldquoforeign investors.Take Fortalia Consult, a now struck-off LLP. It put up m for a .m factory making washing machines, fridges and cookers. The plant, partly funded by the state National Bank of Uzbekistan, employed hundreds. LLPs have to provide more information on Britainrsquos corporate registry, including accounts. Fortalia, in its last year of existence, , made an operating profit of pound on a turnover of just over pound,. A company investing millions in a white appliances factory made a profit of under a tenner. It did, however, file a PSC. She was Uzbek.Official bulletins, government press releases and state-controlled media reports suggest SLPs and LLPs whose owners are either Uzbeks or unknown have made declared ldquoforeign direct investments of well over poundm in recent years.Other investments officially made by SLPs and LLPs are in real-world factories making everything from spinning equipment to probiotic dairy produce.One of the businesses investing in a major new business district, Tashkent City, is an Edinburgh SLP called Corso Solutions. Corso was created last year but has failed to comply with new rules under which it was supposed to say who its owner is. Fines for failure to comply are pound a day. None has ever been levied.TashkentHuman rights campaigners ndash Uzbek and international ndash have grave concerns about this. They want to know who is buying up chunks of the countryrsquos economy. They are especially concerned about equity and other investments in cotton, the nationrsquos biggest industry.Uzbekistan is currently reforming its cotton farms, which have a record of forced labour ndash slavery, effectively ndash and environmental abuses which have led to the near-disappearance of one of the worldrsquos biggest lakes, the Aral Sea.

She is a journalist and campaigner who was jailed under Mirziyoyevrsquos predecessor, the authoritarian Islam Karimov. Now based in Berlin, she leads the Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights .She says: ldquoThe cotton sector in Uzbekistan is entirely under the control of the state which sets the price of cotton and is the sole beneficiary of revenue from sales on the international market.\"Umida NiyazovaShe adds: ldquoUGF has been monitoring and reporting on state-organised forced labour in Uzbekistanrsquos cotton sector for over eight years. We can confirm that, despite some changes, mass mobilization of forced labour and extortion from organisations and employees to pay for cotton pickers is again ongoing during this yearrsquos cotton harvest, despite Mirziyoyevrsquos public commitments to eradicate it.ldquoFor decades, the production of cotton has been underpinned by a system ... in which Uzbekistanrsquos citizens are forcibly mobilised to pick cotton. This is a state-operated system of forced labour, in which the Uzbek government imposes regional cotton production quotas which are, in turn, allocated by regional officials to their sub-districts.ldquoRegional and district officials are responsible for meeting these quotas under threat of penalty.ldquoWe have observed a proleration of Uzbek entities registered as limited partnerships in Scotland and England, including a number of companies with direct ties to the cotton industry.ldquoWe are interested to know why these companies, in receipt of large swathes of foreign direct investment, want to register in Scotland. Why do these companies not disclose their ownership  Given that hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign direct investment are flowing into the country at this time, the UK government must ensure these companies are not a vehicle for money laundering.ldquoUzbekistanrsquos cotton sector has already disrupted the lives of millions. It would be criminalthey were to be robbed of revenue which should ultimately benefit the Uzbek people.Abandoned ships on the dried-out Aral SeaUzbek sources stress they have no evidence SLPs or LLPs investing in cotton or other industries are responsible for human rights abuses. Nor do they have evidence any nominally UK registered firms are fronts for government officials or others who wish to conceal their identities. They just want to know who is behind investment. They have reason to be concerned. SLPs have been widely abused where in the former Soviet Union, including as part of multi-billion-dollar schemes to launder money out of Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan.At last count, some  Uzbeks were named as the PSCs of SLPs. But multiple investigations reveal closer links. A nephew of former leader Islam Karimov in  was named as the effective controller of SLPs involved in a dispute over the ownership of hotels in Riga which culminated in an attempted gangland-style hit.Last year an international journalistic investigation alleged that Karimovrsquos youngest daughter, Lola, and her husband used three SLPs ndash two of which, Five Star Star Technology Support and Greenhall Management, are based in Douglas ndash as part of complex offshore scheme.

The so-called ldquomega scandal ndash nearly bn was paid out, Odebrecht admits ndash has rocked the western hemisphere and led to prosecutions against senior officials in multiple jurisdictions.A former president of Peru, who denies using an SLP based at a Glasgow law firm to take money infor a highway contract, is among those facing prosecution. A senior state oil official close to the outgoing president of Mexico also dismisses reports he took money from the construction firm through SLPs.In Argentina, government anti-corruption investigators have focused on a prominent entrepreneur called Jorge Rodriacuteguez, though he usually goes by the nickname ldquoCorcho, or ldquoCork.In a ldquobox office celebrity court case, Rodriacuteguez is accused of taking in bribes from Odebrecht, which was among companies bidding to build a metro line. He denies any wrongdoing.Corcho Rodriacuteguez, from YouTubeAn Argentinian government report suggests money was transferred the tax haven bank accounts of two SLPs to Uruguay. From there, investigators allege, Rodriacuteguez used his fleet of private plans to fly money in cash across the River Plate to a small airfield near Buenos Aires. Figures of up to m have been cited.The two SLPs named in official papers are Latin Financial and Capital Investment Enterprises, both of which were created and dissolved without ever filing any meaningful paperwork. Rodriacuteguez says he has no connection with the two Scottish firms. His Uruguayan accountants, in testimony, say they were his.The case continues.

And others realised they were also enticing for people who want to avoid more than just tax.Writer Oliver Bullough has explored the murky world of international offshore finance ndash and its effect on some of the planetrsquos poorest nations ndash for his book Moneyland. He has long watched SLPs being abused.ldquoSLPs and shell structures like them are absolutely crucial to anyone who has wealth to hide, he explains. ldquoWithout them, it would be impossible for crooks and thieves ndash whether theyrsquore rulers of former Soviet states, or leaders of drugs cartels ndash to move their wealth out of the shadows and into the legitimate economy.\"Bulloughs bookHe adds: ldquoSLPs are useful to crooks because, unlike limited partnerships where in the UK, they have legal personality and thus can own bank accounts and other assets, enter into contracts, and take on debt. If the SLPrsquos partners are offshore companies, then their ownership is completely opaque.ldquoThe great advantage of Britain as a place to register a company is that the company looks legitimate, because itrsquos British, but really is not. Our money-laundering regime is so lax, and Companies House doesnrsquot check the accuracy of any information supplied to it. This is why British structures are almost iniably found in the biggest financial scandals.The abuse of SLPs, Bullough stresses, is not a victimless crime. ldquoMore than a trillion dollars a year is stolen from the worldrsquos poorest countries, devastating their economies and spreading misery and destitution, he says. ldquoThat would not be possible without shell structures like SLPs, and itrsquos imperative the UK Government acts to reform them to they can no longer be misused in this way.A map of just some of the SLP scandals in recent yearsA spokesman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \"The UK is leading the global fight against money laundering. \"Changes to the law last year have increased the transparency of these financial arrangements, reducing the likelihood of them being used for illegal purposes.ldquoWe carefully developed our recent reforms to further prevent these crimes without harming the legitimate businesses and pensions that invest through limited partnerships.Registrations of SLPs have fallen in the last year after new PSC reguilations were introduced and, crucially, banks in Latvia started refusing to handle their accounts.Comment: Alison Thewliss on why SLP reform cannot waitMore than three months have passed since the UK Government closed its consultation on the reform of limited partnerships, and despite calls for recommendations to be published, nothing has been forthcoming.Today we see yet more evidence linking limited partnerships to opprobrious behaviour abroad this time with regards cotton production in Uzbekistan.Agencies such as Amnesty International, and the Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights, have gone to great s to expose the coercive and manipulative nature of this industry.Alison ThewlissThe purported involvement of financial vehicles registered in the UK ndash with little or no information offered on ultimate ownership ndash should be of serious concern to UK Government Ministers.Unfortunately, thatrsquos not likely to be the case as far as the UK Government is concerned. A volley of evidence has been sent their way, but met only with indference.The UK Government must take a firm stance on limited partnerships being used to fund corrupt activities and perpetuate human-rights abuses, and stop ignoring the scandal that is continuing to take place on their doorstep.Alison Thewliss is the SNP MP for Glasgow Central"},{"url":null,"title":"lord-adonis-scottish-labour-should-lead-the-way-in-calling-for-a-brexit-vote","story":"Now, though, we are in the fight of our lives to stop this Brexit mess.

They also called on the Scottish government to tackle the problem with action, not words.The \"paid by the minute\" scandal centres on the care industry where councils outsource care at home to private or charitable companies. Care staff are electronically monitored ndash clocking in and out of a clientrsquos home ndash using technology such as mobile phones or iPads.As an example,a carer has five jobs in an hour each lasting six minutes then they will be paid by the minute for a total of  minutes. If the worker is on the Scottish living wage ndash pound. an hour ndash this would see them earn approximately pound. for an hourrsquos work, or just under  pence per minute. Many are not paid for the time in between jobs, or for travel to and from jobs.Scottish Care, which represents private care providers, estimates that the practice of \"paying by the minute\" occurs in half of Scotlandrsquos  council areas. An estimated  per cent ndash or  people ndash of the private care workforce, which stands at ,, are on zero-hours contracts, where most of the \"paid by the minute\" work is found. However, the numbers on ZHCs rises to - per cent in the sector of \"older peoplersquos care\".Care providers and carers are also penalisedworkers stay over the allotted time per visit, in the event of a client being ill or distressed.Scottish Care said: ldquoOver the last few years Scottish Care has continually argued for improvements to conditions which make employment in the care sector precarious for too many iniduals. One of these is the call to offer properly funded contracts to providers to enable them to reduce dependency on zero-hour contracts ... While admittedly some staff desire the flexibility that such contracts provide them with, from our research the vast majority of providers wish to move to a situation where adequate funding makes full-time contracts for the care workforce a possibility.ldquoThe main reason for the existence of zero-hours contracts is the discriminatory practice around the way in which care is bought from charitable and private providers by the public authorities. A local authority only pays for the work which is done rather than what may be intended. This makes it impossible to guarantee hours for many, especially smaller care providers.\"Scottish Care believes that we need to radically change the way we commission and buy care services ... At the moment many, especially smaller organisations, are effectively paid by the minute and therefore by extension unless the provider has its own reserves and assets the worker is paid by the minute. This is no way to deliver care in the st century.ldquoWe are faced with a scenario where workers are pressurised to get tasks done in as quick a time as possible and are penalisedthey are late for their next client. For the person receiving the care this makes the whole experience less than dignied despite the best efforts of inidual care workers ... This is especially unacceptable when we are talking about supporting people with palliative and end-of-le care.Dr Donald Macaskill, chief executive of Scottish Care, said: \"There is something very wrong about a local authority treating its own staff fairly and well and yet treating the staff of services they buy in, whether they are employed by a charity or private care provider, in a manner which is little less than exploitative. Workers are made to clock in and clock out and their organisations are only being paid by the minute, and even thena worker is late or stays longer because someone needs more help or is ill they are being penalised.ldquoThese electronic call monitoring systems are treating care staff asthey cannot be trusted. They do not give dignity or value to a critical workforce. If we ever want to create a fair system of work we need a fair system for commissioning care.\"We have a massive challenge to attract people to do the fundamentally important job of care. People are being put off because of unfair conditions imposed by local authorities upon care organisations.

The control, the powerlessness ndash it all piled up and left him on the edge of a nervous breakdown, he says.Alan worked across Scotland for DPD ndash probably the best known courier service in the UK, sending packages around the country on behalf of retail giants like John Lewis and Marks and Spencer. Alan worked for the company ndash the biggest parcel provider after the Post Office ndash from .He saw an advert for an ldquoowner driver franchise with the company, billed as self-employment, and thought it would be a perfect fit for him. As self-employed Alan could work when he wanted, have weekends with his family, and be his own boss. Today, Alan describes the job as a ldquomassive lie.What Alan experienced is something campaigners call bogus self-employment ndash a growing phenomenon in the UK where employers bring someone on as self-employed but treat them asthey were a member of staff. That means they get none of the perks of being staff ndash they have to pay their own tax and national insurance, and they donrsquot get sick pay or holiday pay ndash but all of the drawbacks. ldquoWhen the bosses said jump, we had to say lsquohow high rsquo,Alan said.Alan got only two weeks holiday a year, had to work every Monday to Friday, as well as weekends when ordered, and when he worked there drivers were fined poundthey took a day off sick. Ruth Lane, the widow of DPD driver Don Lane, is suing the company over her husbandrsquos death. Lane missed medical appointments as he feared the pound fine. He had diabetes and had been charged by DPD after attending a specialist renal appointment. He went on to miss other appointments. He collapsed twice at work.His we says Lane was vomiting blood but still went to work due to his fear of being fined. On the day of his death, he completed his deliveries but suffered a heart attack when he arrived home and later died in hospital. In February, one month after Lanersquos death, DPD began to phase out fines and abolished them altogether in July. Alan says: ldquoIt is a disgrace that it took the death of a decent man to bring this about. It was a Victorian system.Alan also had to hire the van he drove from the company for nearly pound a month and pay for fuel and repairs. UK Government rules permit a maximum of  hoursrsquo driving in any working day ndash but Alan says he often spent  hours behind the wheel.Like all workers in the gig economy, it was the precarious nature of his employment which left Alan most vulnerable. ldquoWe were afraid to say anything. The threat was that you could be dismissed at any moment and told your services were no longer required so we did what we were told ndash we all have mortgages and mouths to feed, he said.Fair employment campaigners, like the Better Than Zero campaign run by the STUC in Scotland, believe many corporations can only generate the profits they do thanks to their employment practices ndash which often involve no contributions to sick pay, pensions, holidays, tax and national insurance. DPDrsquos operating profit rose  per cent last year to pound million.Alan said that, eventually, he ldquowas frightened of what was going to happen to myself and my health. I couldnrsquot carry on there because of the hours. I donrsquot like to admit it but I was honestly heading for a breakdown. I was bordering on tearful. I couldnrsquot even go to the doctor to get help as Irsquod get hit with a pound fine.He left his role as an ldquoowner driver franchisee with DPD earlier this year.lsquoManagement have the power ... staff have very few rightsrsquoWhen most people think of the gig economy, they think of a Deliveroo cyclist or an Uber driver ndash people working here and there were they can, earning a living in the new digitally-driven industries. But that view isnrsquot the whole picture.Fay waitresses at Grand Central Hotel in Glasgow and is on a zero-hours contract ndash a contract which guarantees you no working hours. For staff in all sectors, shts are often changed at the last moment and staff are sent home earlywork is quiet ndash and not paid for the hours they were due to work ndash and they are often asked and expected to work overtime at short notice.ldquoIt makes it exceptionally hard to manage your le, says Faye. Staff on these contracts in all employment sectors can see their pay fluctuate wildly depending on how much work they are offered, meaning it is hard to balance domestic finances. Childcare can become problematicstaff are asked to work at short notice, and late-night travel home worries many women staff.Faye, who is a union activist, said: ldquoZero-hours contracts give management the power to bully and harass ndash as staff just have to take it. Management give the hours to the people they think most deserve it. They have the power to do what they want and staff have very little rightsany.The owner regularly lsquoslaps female staff on the backsidersquoEmma, who waitresses at a well-known restaurant in Glasgow, spoke of the climate of sexism that pervades the hospitality industry for low-paid staff. Young women are often told to wear heels, skirts and make-up, and find thatthey donrsquot comply they can soon see their shts vanish.In the restaurant where she works the owner regularly ldquoslaps female staff on the backside. She added: ldquoMost are migrant workers with little English and they just take it as they feel it would be too hard to get another job.Emma also told of shts being cancelled at the last minute. In the restaurant where she works the biggest problem is that staff have no contracts at all. There was also delayed payment of wages to staff, short-changing for overtime, and staff being forced into split shtsthe restaurant was quiet ndash this would see a waitress told to take an unpaid break of two or three hours between lunch and dinner. ldquoIt seems like the employment policy is just to treat people like s**t, she said.Bad employment practices can also be reflected in a bad attitude to customers. Emma told of cheap brand vodka being decanted as Smirnoff at the restaurant, and wine from unfinished bottles being resold. ldquoI would love to report them to Trading Standards, she says, ldquobut how many people, including myself, will end up being out of work.lsquoI was sick but did a -hour sht as I was scared Irsquod get no workrsquoSandra also worked in a well known Glasgow restaurant ndash she, too, was given no contract. ldquoWithin a few weeks, I realised Irsquod got myself into a bad situation, she says. Her hours fluctuated hugely ndash sometimes she worked  hours a week, sometimes . Like many other waitresses, she found herself ordered homethe restaurant was quiet. After multiple staff departures, she found herself working  hour days.She was one of the few members of staff to receive pay slips. Sandra pestered the owners for correct paperwork as she wanted to ensure her tax and national insurance were being paid. Most other staff made no such demands. Suppliers were also paid cash in hand.ldquoOne week we were all paid cash in hand and told that tax was still being paid for us ndash but how did we know that was true  Sandra said. ldquoMost of my pay slips also had the wrong tax and national insurance information. Other staff who got pay slips found no tax had been taken off them even though they were earning over the threshold. I have no idea what on earth was going on when it came to the taxman.There were rodents in the food store ndash even though the venue has a prestigious reputation among diners. Staff were too scared to speak up about the problems all around them. ldquoThere were cases were people stood up to the bosses and they just didnrsquot get another sht. There were days when I was sick but came in and did a -hour sht as I was scared I would get no more work. Basically, the bosses were like greedy factory owners from the th century ndash they couldnrsquot get enough money and they didnrsquot care about staff.Sandra also spoke of bullying. On one occasion, staff had brought in their own food as they were working at a wedding reception all day. They left their lunches in bags in the staff room. A director tied the bags together and took bets on how long it would take hungry staff to get their food. ldquoThe impression you got is that we were not human in their eyes, says Sandra.Another member of staff describes her time at the restaurant as a ldquonightmare. She had no contract, her pay was late and she was given no payslip.ldquoThroughout my time there [the owners] consistently treated us like slaves, talked to us as though we were children and obviously considered us lesser human beings who didnrsquot deserve to be paid for the hard work we put in to keeping their business afloat.lsquoI have no idea how a waitress can be considered as self-employed, but I needed the workrsquoGwen Garret is  and now doing her masters degree in medieval history ndash but until recently she worked in one precarious job after another. ldquoThey were all terrible in their own way,rsquo she says. ldquoMost jobs were paying illegally with cash in hand. I would ask for pay slips and most refused.ldquoThere was a factory job ndash they paid with a pay slip. A cafe ndash that was cash in hand. A kebab place ndash that was cash in hand. A whisky bar ndash they paid with pay slips. A sushi place ndash they also refused to pay with a pay slip.Nerys, another masters student, also had a succession of precarious jobs ndash but her worst experience came when she worked for a social enterprise. Social enterprises are meant to help good causes ndash an example of a social enterprises doing what they are meant to do would be the Big Issue magazine which runs as a business but helps the homeless. Often, social enterprises get financial breaks and incentives from government.ldquoI have no idea how a waitress can be considered self-employed, but I needed the work, she said. ldquoThis was the most dodgy place I ever worked for. I also had all the down sides of a zero-hours contract ndash so I didnrsquot now how many hours I was getting or when I would get called on to work.Nerys said she worked for four months at the social enterprise and saw one person in all that time come to use the services for the disabled and elderly.The STUCrsquos Better Than Zero campaign is investigating this social enterprise and others.lsquoI ended up with anxiety ndash sitting in bed crying at nightrsquoBelinda was just  when she went to work as a waitress in a well-known Scottish restaurant. She experienced the usual zero-hours problems ndash random hours, unpaid overtime, tips not paid, split shts ndash and was also paid cash in hand. However, the schoolgirl was also touched inappropriately by a member of staff, and when she told her employer he said ldquojust stand up for yourself. No other action was taken.Kyle Scott also began working in hospitality aged just  and pulled pints in many bars around the Central Belt, where all of his employment was under a zero-hours contract. ldquoIt was always very dficult to get a day off as yoursquod be seen as a hindrance and the boss would just start cutting your shts. Irsquove seen people ask for a day off and just get told to get to f***, he said.He also spoke of sexual harassment of female staff by customers. ldquoYoung women would go to speak to the manager and be told lsquolook we need their revenue, they need to stay in the pubrsquo. So they arenrsquot kicked out. It happens widely across the hospitality industry.ldquoIf you are injured or sick or sexually harassed you say nothing as that could put you out of work ndash we basically have no rights. You drop everything do to what the boss says ndash asyou donrsquot, then you are scared you will never get a sht again.ldquoI ended up with an anxiety disorder ndash sitting in bed crying at night as I didnrsquot know what shts I was getting so I couldnrsquot plan my le. It was mentally and physically exhausting.Some weeks Kyle would work  hours, at other times he went without a sht for three weeks. ldquoYou have to suck up to the boss to get shts, and thatrsquos grim as you are put in direct competition with your peers and friends to see who gets the most shts.ldquoOne of my biggest memories is the number of people breaking down crying. Irsquod see that at least a few times a day as people were so mentally exhausted. We even had a joke that there was a lsquono crying in the glass washrsquo rule.Kyle is now working for Strathclyde student union after graduating and loves his new job in campaigns and policy. ldquoItrsquos a genuine breath of fresh air, he says, ldquoit is the first time I have ever been happy going to work.

He wasnrsquot paid a penny for a monthrsquos work, he says ndash and is still in dispute with his employer, who canrsquot be named for this reason.Josh says he worked nearly all of June and was owed almost pound. When he tried to get what he was owned, his employer hit him with allegations of theft, which Josh claims are lies. The row got uglier last week after the Herald on Sunday began trying to find out what had been going on.ldquoJosh said: lsquoI just want to make certain that other people donrsquot get stung like me.lsquoOur tax pounds are propping up this systemrsquoAmazon has courted more than a little controversy as an employer ndash and no-one knows more about what the giant gets up to than Jim McCourt, one of Scotlandrsquos most determined campaigners for employment rights, and the manager of Inverclyde Advice and Employment Rights Centre near Amazonrsquos Greenock plant.This is one of his busiest times of year as sub-contracted agency workers are drafted in to Amazon to work on the Christmas rush. ldquoThe worst and sharpest employment practices are bred in the sub-contract culture, McCourt says. ldquoThis is fundamental to how abuse and control takes place.Agency workers, says McCourt, are dismissed for the slightest infractions, such as too many toilet breaks orthey canrsquot make overtime. ldquoThey will get a phone call from the agency, McCourt says, ldquoand be told they are not required back. That terries the rest of the workforce.It also plunges people into poverty, says McCourt ndash as many agency workers were unemployed before entering the gig economy anddismissed will have to endure the wait for their benefits to be reinstated. Many have been sent by job centres to agencies and told to take the job the agencies offer them or risk being sanctioned.Amazon ndash which has around , UK workers and recognises no trade union ndash announced this month that it was raising wages for its staff employees. The move was hailed as a positive step forward by a company which has been under fire over employment practices for years. The Scottish Government had been criticised for giving Amazon pound.m in taxpayer money.Last month, though, new rules were announced that there would be no state handouts in Scotland for firms which did not pay the living wage. Shortly afterwards, Amazon announced it would raise wages for employees. What went pretty much unnoticed though was that Amazon simultaneously decided to phase out its bonus and stock award programmes for hourly workers.ldquoWhat that all amounts to, says McCourt, ldquois no benefit to the workers. Staff are furious but not surprised.In separate investigations, McCourt has also come across an increasing number of employers using absence management policies which seem designed to sack staff who have been off sick. ldquoThere is a growing occupational health industry which works hand-in-hand with employers to get staff dismissed, he said, citing cases where employers ignored details of sickness provided by GPs and consultants, but instead relied on assessments from private occupational health advisors which results in dismissal. ldquoThis is the world we live in, says McCourt.He has also uncovered a new scandal in the gig economy ndash workers being paid literally by the minute in the private care sector.As the care sector becomes increasingly privatised, companies are being hired by councils to provide care to the sick and elderly in their homes. Many care staff are on zero-hours contracts ndash but thousands are also paid by the minute.ldquoItrsquos the ultimate in the gig economy, says McCourt. ldquoCompanies bid against each other for a contract and it is a race to the bottom. They bid with prices they canrsquot meet and it is their workers who suffer.An example of a care worker paid by the minute would be as follows: a care worker has five jobs in an hour ndash going to the homes of clients to help with their personal needs and medication ndash each job takes six minutes, meaning the carer is viewed as having worked  minutes in an hour.ldquoThese private care companies are funded by the public purse, says McCourt, ldquoas they are contracted by councils ndash so our tax pounds are propping up this system. There is a big dference here to other employment practices as we are not talking about stacking CDs in a warehouse ndash this is about looking after the most vulnerable people in society.ldquoWe are looking at a value set here ndashpeople think there is money to be made in this way out of caring for the sick and elderly then there is something very wrong, especiallythe public purse is being used.Background: Workers are stepping back in time to darker ageA BROWSE through the files of Better Than Zero is like stepping into a time machine and travelling back to the days of the dark satanic mills of the Industrial Revolution.Itrsquos a litany of employees begging their boss for work, staff having to pander to management in order to secure shts, of bullying, harassment, humiliation, low wages, people living hand to mouth, and the steady erosion of pride and dignity. There are examples of female staff who have asked to change shts being texted by their male manager saying: \"My we is out tonight, why donrsquot you come round and then I will change your sht.\"\"The work is sold to the employee as flexible,\" says Sarah Collins of BTZ, \"but there is no flexibility for the worker.\" Staff are expected to take what shts are offered to them, regardless of how few or how many the hours are ndashthey cause a fuss and stand up for themselves itrsquos unlikely they will get any more work. \"All the control is with the employer,\" Collins adds.One of the latest issues within precarious employment is the rise of questionable practices within a small minority of social enterprise firms ndash companies meant to be doing a social good and often in receipt of financial support from the public purse. Some social enterprises are hiring staff on zero hours contracts ldquothen quickly sacking or dismissing themthey raise any concerns. BTZ spoke of firms claiming to be involved in sustainable transport initiatives pressurising and bullying staff on zero hour contracts, or paying cash in hand. There are reports of similar behaviour by social enterprise companies refurbishing kitchen goods or furniture for the poor and elderly to buy at cheap rates.\"On the surface they look great, and there are plenty of social enterprises doing great work but the model has been perverted by a few for bad reasons,\" BTZ said.\"Bogus self-employment\" is another new problem ndash it crossed over from the gig economy where some food delivery drivers were hired on a self-employed basis and is now in many sectors. The organisation cites the case of a beautician in a nail bar who was taken on as self-employed but was told by management when to come in, when to go home, and how much to charge.\"They are not self-employed at all,\" says BTZ. \"It is just a cost saving exercise as the employer is not paying tax, national insurance, sick pay, holiday pay, or pension contributions. There is a big issue here of the exchequer potentially missing out on huge amounts of tax.Self-employment has massively increased since the financial crash of . The largest increase is among women in the following three occupations: cleaners, child minders and hairdressers. Most people drt in and out of self-employment as they look for more stable, less precarious jobs.\"The Scottish Government is projecting Scotland as a wonderful place to visit, but who is checking on the labour conditions of the people in the tourism industry,\" BTZ says.At the core of the problems with zero hours contracts, in particular, is the bullying it seems to enable in the worst managers ndash staff who want to work as many hours as possible are unlikely to defend themselvestreated badly by their boss. Precarious employment also affects young workers in their late teens and early s more than other age groups.\"Bullying is everywhere,\" says BTZ. \"This leads to burn out, mental health problems...unemployment may be at an all time low but the human cost is Dickensian. Couple all this with the housing situation and you see that precarious work leads to precarious lives. If you donrsquot have a steady income and are just bumping from job to job and house to house, every aspect of your le is affected.\"If you are on zero hours you arenrsquot going to get a mortgage, and yoursquoll need a guarantor for private rented accommodation. Thatrsquos why sofa surfacing is on the rise, why people who previously lived independently are moving back home to their parents. It makes people vulnerable not just to loan sharking but even sex for rent. It all knits together. This is what young people have come to expect in Scotland in .Insecure work can also mean in-work poverty as well. Two parents in insecure employment can actually be worse off financially than a family on benefits.Precarious employment has a corrosive effect, with zero hour contracts now even affecting university lecturers it is little wonder, BTZ believes, that young people are leaving school with a jaded view of the world of work and the opportunities on offer to them.\"The most depressing thing is that young people think this is the norm,\" said Sarah Collins. \"They know what is happening is not right, but they donrsquot have any expectation of any other type of work.\"Better Than Zero said: \"It is all well and good saying we want a fair work society, a fair work economy, but on the frontline it is almost laughable how far these claims and aspirations are from the way that huge numbers of people make a living.\"BTZ said that the impact on mental health of precarious employment was a growing problem. Disabled workers are often the most vulnerable to exploitation too. If a disabled worker on a zero hours contract starts asking for wheelchair ramps, or other assistance at work, itrsquos easy for an unscrupulous employer to just take them off the rota, BTZ says.The night-time economy, where a lot of precarious employment is found, is only set to grow in Scotland as bars and clubs push for later licensing laws. Butyou are a young female member of staff on zero hours, with little power to argue for an earlier sht, then going home late at night becomes a hazard of work. Few companies pay for staff to get taxis even in the early hours of the morning.BTZ has accounts in its files of staff finishing work at am and waiting for the first bus in the morning to get home, or staff going to a casino that stays open until dawn and buying one drink to nurse until public transport starts again. There are reports of female staff being harassed and intimidated on late night streets.As the campaign team of BTZ say of all the cases they are investigating, \"is a little dignity, respect, and safety too much to ask \"The Herald on Sunday asked the Scottish Government to put forward the relevant minister for interview on matters related to precarious employment and the gig economy. No interview was forthcoming.Reaction: what the companies sayGRAND CENTRAL HOTELA spokesperson for Grand Central said they did not accept that the comments about the hotel ldquoin any way represent the experience of our valued colleagues.

showcasing Glasgow as an outstanding global city, one thats welcoming and vibrant with a rich cultural heritage, a flourishing food and drink sector and an unrivalled visitor experience.\"Tennents investment in this exciting new attraction strongly reflects our ambition and will undoubtedly boost Glasgows tourism economic in the coming years.\"In the s the brands popularity grew and the famous

due to leave the European Union next spring.In an interview with Skyrsquos Sophy Ridge on Sunday, he said that, despite the current impasse with Brussels over Brexit and the Irish border, his budget

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Monday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amSee this week#s edition of The Orcadian for over thirty job listings.

The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority. We will continue to work closely with Scottish Government, other agencies and industry at this time.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is not some dry, academic debate. The potential health consequences of ministers failing to heed the advice of their own experts are serious.“I hope the Health Secretary will use her influence, therefore, to persuade her colleague, the Housing Minister, to accept the case for using a Rural Minimum Income Standard to help define fuel poverty in rural and island areas.  This is the only way of ensuring those who need help get the support they need.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes. Tickets for the concert will be released on Monday, October , and will be available at the council’s customer services points in School Place, Kirkwall, and Warehouse Buildings, Stromness.At .pm, a lone bugler at St Magnus Cathedral will join , inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic ‘Last Post’.This will be followed by the lighting of a beacon on the St Magnus Cathedral kirk green at pm as part of the national Beacons of Light event which will see beacons lit across the country, symbolising an end to the darkness of war andto the light of peace.St Magnus Cathedral will remain the focus as, at .pm, the bells will ring alongside , others across the nation and beyond.Between pm and pm, the short film specially commissioned by the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative for the centenary of the armistice will be projected onto the cathedral for the last time.The convener of Orkney Islands Council, Harvey Johnston, said: “We are grateful to everyone who has worked with us so far to ensure we have a fitting programme of events here in Orkney for people to mark this momentous occasion and pay their respects to forbears who suffered so much. I hope people will involve and immerse themselves in these events as much as they can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Inkson, have been fondly remembered down the years and credited with greatly boosting the French linguistic capabilities of those involved.As well as sowing the seeds for lasting friendships, one of the exchanges also led to the eventual marriage of Alistair Swanson of Dingwall and Belgian Marie-Anny De Landsheer. Alistair lived next door to Marie-Annyrsquos Scottish exchange partner, Sandra, daughter of the late Sandy and Lilly Macrae.With some of those attending a th anniversary meeting in Dingwall now in their s and s, there was much to catch on. One of those present, George Robertson, said the stark contrast between the new and old Dingwall Academy buildings amazed those present.\"The day began with a guided tour of Dingwall Academy, graciously hosted by rector, Mrs Karen Cormack and two equally charming assistants, Ceitidh Petrie of fth Year and head girl, Anna-Maria Stewart of sixth year. We were amazed by the change in the Academy mdash from the grim corridors with its memories of rooms with formal rows of desks, piles of jotters and frequent administrations of summary justice mdash with the lsquoLochgelly Specialrsquo mdash to the cosy, student-friendly comfort of modern classrooms, sumptuously equipped with digital projectors and interactive whiteboards.\"Gone are the dingy cloakrooms, in the corners of which, stressed-out procrastinators struggled furiously to finish their homework on time! Gone too, are the endless, uncouth nicknames we used to give our teachers, Pirrac, Froggy, Daisy-lugs, Kate Stew, Inky, Willie the War, Kramer, Horace, Scabbac, Sinkie, Snottery Tom and so on.\"He added: \"We soon realised that Dingwall Academy is a much happier, kinder place than the strictly regimented establishment, where we learned, suffered, cried, laughed and fell in, and out, of love! The old school, however, was not all bad, because we had the good fortune of being taught by many caring, brilliant teachers who inspired and challenged us, and whom we still remember with great fondness. J.K.Inkson was one of those par excellence, but kind and modest, despite his many gts.\"After welcome refreshments in the Academy cafe, the group enjoyed a tour of Dingwall Museum.Mr Robertson said: \"The culminating highlight of our day was, without doubt, the get-together and dinner in the Royal Hotel, Cromarty. We were able to catch up with more of our old friends and former schoolmates. We were formally welcomed by Sandra Collardand by Marie-Anny, who addressed us in flawless English. The dinner was a splendid affair, with a host of gastonomic delicacies, all excellently prepared.\"The old friends recalled the lasting benefits of their exchanges down the years.

The ersion could then reopen to traffic shortly after a train clears the other side.Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP, Ian Blackford has been campaigning for the revised system with support from Scottish Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson.Mr Blackford said: \"This has the potential to be great news and work now must be put in place to make these plans a reality. I would like to put on record my gratitude to Network Rail for listening to concerns of the local community and of representatives like myself.\"Despite matters relating to Network Rail being reserved to Westminster, I knew the best hope was for the Scottish Government to try and make clear that the sorry state of affairs that we have all witnessed, couldnrsquot be allowed to continue. Let me be frank, these changes would not have been possible without the intervention of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson MSP.\"The local communities deserve a huge amount of credit as well. Local representatives have campaigned tirelessly and have sought to keep people informed when information wasnrsquot always forthcoming from Highland Council.\"I hope now that we can move forward from what has been an extremely trying situation for local communities.\"Network Rail confirmed the new system is something it is actively looking into, but that it was not yet in a position to proceed and had no specic start date for its introduction.But a spokesman added that the system was similar to one that was introduced on the same stretch of track in  after another serious landslide, so the idea is feasible.Monday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Mr Hammond was handed a windfall of some £ billion due to better-than-expected borrowing figures, easing some of the pressure to put up taxes. However his statement will be closely watched to see where he does decide to apply the pain.Pensions tax relief. One target for the Chancellor as he looks to raise funds could be the tax breaks for pensions savings which benefit millions of middle and high earners.: Christine Jardine - Theresa May’s austerity claim will be put to the testMr Hammond suggested he had them in his sights at the recent IMF meeting in Bali when he described the £ billion-a-year cost to the Treasury as “eye-wateringly expensive”.

Conservative MPs are also growing increasingly restive over the impending national roll-out of UC amid fears that some of their least well-off constituents could be plunged into real hardship.The Chancellor has signalled he is ready to find extra cash to ease the transition, but will it be enough to satisfy critics calling for another £ billion Digital tax. Mr Hammond has been talking tough about the need for internet giants like Facebook and Google to pay their “fair share” of tax in the UK.While he acknowledges concerted international action is the best way to get them to cough up, he has expressed frustration at the slow rate of progress on reaching an agreement.

Having a conviction for driving without appropriate insurance that he picked up while a transport minister was not a recommendation.Every day the actions of Humza Yousaf suggest he is unfit for that office and the First Minister does not act, compounds the question surrounding her judgement. If the minister had any sense of self-awareness, and what is appropriate behaviour for a justice minister, he would spare Nicola Sturgeon her blushes and decide to relinquish his role and spend more time with his family. With Humza Yousaf’s penchant for being in the limelight such voluntary sacrice is as unlikely as the First Minister admitting she can be so demonstrably wrong in judging people.In an interview published this month Mr Yousaf talked freely of his upset at the criminal investigation into his former colleague and leader, Alex Salmond, on accusations of sexual misconduct. He described it as “utterly heartbreaking” but there was no report of his thoughts for those who might be intimidated about bringing such charges against men of power, no revelations about his concerns towards how alleged victims might feel. There was no sense of awareness how he – as Justice Secretary – might make those women, and other women in similar positions who are yet to speak up – feel by showing more concern for Salmond than for women potentially abused. Nor did he appear aware he might be contributing to a public perception – before any possible future jury trial – that Alex Salmond’s character is beyond question.Surely he should have refused to comment on the matter at all, other than to acknowledge the legal proceedings were in place and precluded him from revealing his own thoughts  The week then really took off when an Edinburgh Labour councillor, Professor Scot Arthur, who like Humza Yousaf, is a highly active tweeter, invited his followers to take part in a Twitter poll that he devised. For those that do not Tweet I can advise this is a common practice, sometimes in seriousness to establish opinion, sometimes in jest to poke fun at others. Cllr Arthur’s question was, “What attracted Humza Yousaf to politics ” A The   attacks, B The Iraq War, or C The photo calls Now I have not happened to mention Humza Yousaf’s religion in this article so far, which is intentional, because I do not think his religionshould matter in his conduct as Cabinet Secretary for Justice. For Humza Yousaf, however, Cllr Arthur’s Tweet was prejudiced against his faith and race, indeed it was so hateful that when it was brought to his attention he wrote to the leader of Edinburgh Labour Council Group and called for Cllr Arthur’s immediate suspension.Now at this stage you may want to read the Tweet again. It suggests there might be three reasons Mr Yousaf went into politics and one might guess that the point of such a poll was to ridicule the subject by putting the narcisstic attraction of photo calls as the last answer. But why list   and the Iraq War – was that racist or Islamophobic Actually the origins of those first two answers is that only a few days before Humza Yousaf had said in the same interview that   – when he was -years-old – was “hugely to do with where I am today”. This appeared to conflict with a previous comment given to the Herald where Mr Yousaf said, “The Iraq war was the trigger for my politics”.So was it   or the Iraq war – or was it that politics is attractive to people who like being in the limelight  A political opponent had spotted an inconsistency and no doubt thought it worth calling out the Justice Secretary’s forgetfulness.  was a crime against humanity in which, other than the evil perpetrators, hundreds of innocent Muslims died. As is often the case in Islamist terrorist attacks, be they bombings, shootings or vehicles mowing people down, Muslims are innocent victims too. The same goes for the Iraq War – which was prosecuted against a secular state and where people of all religions and none, and of many races died. The US Secretaries of State during its time were Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, both black Americans. Many Muslims served in Operation Desert Storm and the campaigns that followed. It would be a perversion of the truth to suggest it was a war against Islam, or even a particular section of Islam.Nevertheless, such is the nature of social media outrage that it was not long that Cllr Arthur felt he had to unreservedly apologise for his Tweet and deleted it, while the Labour council leader reprimanded him publicly. I know I am not alone in looking at that tweet and not seeing racist or Islamophobic abuse. What I see is a politician undermining real cases of abuse by overreacting and playing the hate crime card. Humza Yousaf is a regular tweeter who is not backwards at attacking opponents and often winds-up supporters of Rangers FC. It’s never racist or sectarian, of course.The problem for those, like Mr Yousaf, who wish to flaunt their opinions about possible objectionable behaviour of others, is that it can easily lead to hypocrisy when comment is dficulta new example is too close to home. Unfortunately for the Justice Secretary, who is a Glasgow politician and can be expected to know what is happening in his own domain, an SNP Councillor, Russell Robertson, appeared in Glasgow Sherf Court last week after being charged with aggravated religious prejudice for allegedly calling his neighbour an “Orange bastard”.Was there a tweet from the Justice Minister  Maybe a letter to the SNP council leader, Susan Aitken, calling for his immediate suspension  No, he was utterly silent. Either the Justice Minister is embarrassed by Mr Robertson’s alleged bigoted behaviour or is at last learning that keeping his counsel is more befitting for the Justice Secretary.

They’d been found guilty of putting a spell on -year-old Christian Shaw, the daughter of a wealthy local laird - to this day, there’s more interest in whether the attention-seeking child really was to blame. A minor historical detail still over-shadows the horror of seven unjust deaths  Why Is it not possible for modern Scots to empathise – to think about the horror of the situation  Seven people, facing horrible deaths over entirely groundless accusations - can we not imagine the terror  Now to be fair, the Paisley event seems to have been a joyful festival with a Mardi Gras atmosphere, acrobats, hundreds of youngsters in brightly coloured costumes and mercully few witches’ hats or broomsticks. But that flippant and facile connection between strangulation and fun, in every radio interview and press article means I, for one, have no urge to attend. Mention of witches still prompts a wee titter and immediate association with Harry Potter, broomsticks and crooked noses. Not the  people accused of witchcraft in Scotland between  and . According to historians Lauren Martin and Joyce Miller in their exhaustive study ‘The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft’  per cent of them were executed,  per cent were women and almost all were tortured. Of course, that’s disputed. Women were not generally placed in the “boots,” “rack” or thumbscrews. Edinburgh woman Agnes Sampson was shackled to her cell wall and stabbed in the face with a four-pronged iron fork, which pierced through her cheeks and tongue – after being accused of plotting to kill King James VI in . But most suspected witches were “only” stripped naked and shaved of all hair including pubic hair to look for “devil’s marks” which were pricked with pins to find insensitive skin “proving” guilt. The idea of being touched, prodded and intimately examined by strange men must have been terrying. The women were then kept awake for days and “encouraged” to confess. A similar witch trial took place at Tullibole Castle near the Crook of Devon in Kinross, home to William Halliday and his son John in . They held court over ‘covens’ in the village and ordered  suspected witches to be strangled and burned. Rosie Hopkins lives near the old execution site and has researched the trials. She says “The women and one man were kept in solitary and in the dark. There is no record of any defence or appeals. That’s how disenfranchised these women were. When they were strangled, every villager was required to watch. The humiliation and terror is still alive and meaningful to me.”Quite. I’m sure I’m not the only mouthy woman looking at these trials thinking, there but for the passage of time, go I. Or, to use a more modern idiom - “Me Too.”It’s important to tease out links between modern women and “witches” of yesteryear because the idea that most were old, poor, disabled or odd is just plain wrong. The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft found  per cent of accused women came from “middle range” homes. Few were lonely spinsters or widows –  per cent were actually married - but almost all were confident, outspoken and assertive. This is what caused offence. As historian Louise Yeoman puts it“The average witch lived in a small borough town. She had an occupation and brought money into the home in her own right. She had a sharp tongue and might have fallen out with neighbours – in other words, she was us.”This matters.Despite its relatively small population, Scotland was Europe’s biggest persecutor of witches. King James VI’s personal obsession meant Scottish “witch-finders” were also sent abroad. They burned and killed hundreds of Sami men and women in Arctic Norway – a memorial to those victims was unveiled in  by Norway’s Queen Sonja. But there’s been no similar recognition or rehabilitation here. A site at the entrance to Edinburgh Castle’s esplanade, commemorates the place where Agnes Sampson and three hundred other women were strangled and burned for being witches in .A plaque beside a fountain reads “The wicked head and serene head signy that someused their exceptional knowledge for evil while others... wished their kind nothing but good.”This of course is nonsense. Scottish society stopped believing in the powers of witchcraft  years ago, so no “wicked head” passing within inches of this plaque during its last terried minutes on this earth could possibly have committed harm by thought or speech alone. Yet the plaque remains.Ten years ago, a campaign to pardon Scotland’s “witches” was rejected by Holyrood’s petitions committee because they felt it was wrong to excuse people found guilty under laws of their own time and “dficult to apply modern concepts of knowledge and morality to centuries past”.Really  Earlier this year, thousands of gay and bisexual men prosecuted for having sex under old laws, were quite rightly pardoned by a unanimous vote in the Scottish Parliament. The slur on the reputation of the women slaughtered centuries back is essentially no dferent. As it is, the refusal to recognise witchcraft as the unjust persecution ofwomen means new generations of well-meaning folk are able to ignore the pain, terror and persecution of witch trials and find the quasi-judicial lynching of outspoken women somehow inspiring. But why should the organisers of Paisley’s Halloween Festival recognise this shameful aspect of our history when officialdom in Scotland hardly cares Perhaps next year, Paisley can lead Scotland in respectful commemoration of its persecuted women and ensure that forgotten acts of misogyny don’t get packaged into selling opportunities for black hats, broomsticks and detachable warts at Halloween.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4820979.1540731035!/image/image.jpg","title":"derek mackay demands that chancellor ends austerity in budget","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scotlands Finance Secretary has called on the UK Government to make good on its pledge to \"end austerity\" when the Budget is unveiled on Monday.Derek Mackay has issued the calls as Chancellor Philip Hammond warned that he is ready to introduce an\"emergency Budget\" in the event of a No Deal Brexit when the UK leaves the EU next March.The Scottish Government wants a\"meaningful uplt\" in public services funding and is also concerned about the roll-out of Universal Credit.Read more: Theresa May: Good Brexit deal means end to austerity\"The Prime Minister recently announced she would bring an end to austerity and I want to see this delivered within the UK Governments budget.,\" Mr Mackay said today.\"This statement must be backed up by concrete actions to provide a meaningful uplt in funding for public services, in addition to the funding increases announced for the NHS being delivered as a true net benefit and not offset by other cuts to the Scottish budget.Read more: Why Brexit means austerity will continue\"In a letter to the Chancellor this month, I asked for the roll-out of Universal Credit to be postponed until the flaws are fixed, a position supported by the Public Accounts Committee this week.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"no shortage of goals in action packed weekend ","story":"There was loads of football action on Saturday with LK Galaxy claiming a convincing win against Tizers to win the Association Cup.Final score was an incredible -, with no fewer than five goals coming from Jordan Thomason.Meanwhile, the contest for the County Shield was won by Ness at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that.

This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Monday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in

the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain. “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.“A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.6368375.1413823035!/image/3568985441.jpg","title":"new banbridge tesco extra store opens at the outlet","story":"The new Tesco Extra store at Bridgewater Park, Banbridge, has opened bringing  new jobs to the area and potentially boosting cross-border trade.Tesco unveiled its th store in Northern Ireland last Thursday.

We will have state of the art facilities, this will be a top rate training facility for local clubs and schools. Our kids deserve this. There will be high-tech lighting that will illuminate the pitch but won’t effect the houses near by.“It’s vital that local kids get full use of this facility, we want it filled to capacity every day with schools, we envisage coaches training kids here, Gaelic clubs, soccer clubs, after-schools activities and outdoor gym classes. I believe this will transform the community.”Work is due to begin in December andall goes according to plan it should be completed by the end of March.Cllr Baker said the investment by Belfast City Council is a big boost for the community. “This area suffered badly under Lisburn Council and we are delighted now that this huge investment has come into the area. We have a population of just under , people here and they deserve nothing but first class facilities and that’s what we are delivering.“As a father and a member of the community here I would love nothing better than on a Sunday morning having a blitz here, rather than going to other parts of Belfast.

New graves are only available in Blaris cemetery when someone dies, the days of pre-planning your funeral or purchasing multiple graves are gone, we are almost at crisis point with our cemeteries.”Last year Lisburn and Castlereagh Council was tendered for a new cemetery, however the tender was unsuccessful.Cllr Corr said: “Because of boundary changes people in the Colin area are no longer Lisburn Council meaning they will have to pay more to be buried in Blaris because that cemetery  crematorium is no longer in their jurisdiction.“This is reaching crisis point, we need to have a radical approach, review and rethink around the issue of burials, cremations and cemetery spaces. We can’t wait until the day somebody is refused burial because there is no space.”With that in mind Belfast City Council have come up with the new cemeteries working group to look at these issues and to also come up with ideas around the development of our cemeteries.Cllr Corr said: “I am the party representative on the group and we are coming up with some excellent plans. For example, a new multi-million pound upgrade will be going into Roselawn crematorium.“We still need a new cemetery for North and West Belfast, it’s a very sensitive subject.“Our cemeteries are also in a position where they can become historical and tourist attractions. Look at Tom Hartley’s cemetery tours, they tell the tale of our city, from rich tombs and headstones to poor grounds where thousands of our poor are buried.“Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin is one of the main tourist attractions on the island of Ireland, it went from being a crime hotspot to being a place of beauty and interest, because it tells the tale of the formative years around the formation of the Irish Free State – our cemeteries are no dferent.“There have been books written about the City Cemetery and Milltown Cemetery.”Cllr Corr continued: “Clton Street Graveyard contains the graves of some historically signicant families, including the Dunvilles, the Sinclairs and Henry Joy McCracken, one of the leading United Irishmen. It was closed to public access approximately  years ago due to anti-social behavior. This has now decreased and the local area of Henry Place has been re-generated and a new business hub has been formed. The graveyard remains locked due to concern regarding the safety of some of the monuments. There are currently regular requests for access from tourists and visitors with a genealogical or historical interest in the graveyard.“Our social, political, economic and religious history are in our cemeteries and we need to have them as places we can use for education.“Take for example the City Cemetery heritage project, we want to bring tourists, academics and school children in as well as the local community.Our cemeteries are at their safest when people are in them, Tom Hartley’s tours have proved that.“The purpose of this working group is to give an extra edge and focus while giving the issues of graves, cemeteries and monuments the attention they deserve.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"newington boss crossan demands swift improvement","story":"Steel and Sons Cup quarter-finalSt James’ Swts vNewington Donegal Celtic ParkNEWINGTON manager, Conor Crossan has demanded an improved showing from his side as they continue the defence of their Steel and Sons Cup title with a quarter-final away trip to St James’ Swts on Saturday. The North Belfast side suffered a - home defeat to Lurgan Celtic earlier this month as they lost ground to Championship  league leaders Annagh United. Last Saturday, they bowed out of the Intermediate Cup following a - penalty shoot-out defeat at Maiden City after the game finished - after  minutes. Crossan feels Saturday’s game is the perfect opportunity for his side to rediscover their form in a competition that is close to their hearts. “We are looking forward to Saturday, hopefully we can get back to winning ways,” said Crossan.“The boys know that the performances haven’t been good enough over the last couple of weeks. “We want to stay in as many cup competitions as we can because of the way the league is structured. “It was a poor result and a poor performance against Lurgan Celtic and we had a few players out last Saturday, but it was sore getting beat on penalties.“You always want to be going into the big games on the back of a win and our form of the last two weeks hasn’t been good. “We are going into this match against a team that has won  from  so they’ll be full of confidence. It will be up to me to get the team up for this game.” As defending champions, Newington will be the favourites to progress, especially considering they play in a higher league. Yet, the progress made by St James’ Swts hasn’t gone unnoticed in the north of the city and Crossan is refusing to underestimate the challenge posed by the Swts at Donegal Celtic Park on Saturday. “People might underestimate the Ballymena League, but you have some great teams in that league – the likes of Bangor and Coagh and teams who were in Championship  in recent years,” added the Newington boss. “They are playing at a good level and they have players who have experience of playing in the Irish League. “They’ll be full of confidence and I don’t think they lost too much sleep when they drew us.“They are the type of team who relish the challenge no matter who they face. “They’ve been making noise for a while now.“They will want to build on that start and keep going, but hopefully we can put a stop to that winning run on Saturday.” St James’ Swts assistant manager Dan Murphy, meanwhile, insists the club is “buzzing” ahead of Saturday’s eagerly-anticipated clash with the defending Steel and Sons Cup champions. The West Belfast side have made an incredible start to the   season and have won all  of their game so far. The only stain on an otherwise perfect start came when they lost the points following their - win over last year’s Ballymena and Provincial League winners Glebe after it emerged one of their players should have been serving a suspension arising from a ban with his previous club. St James’ are aiming to go a step further than they managed in last season’s competition when they bowed out after losing - to Linfield Swts in the last eight.  “The whole club is buzzing, we know how big this competition is. We got to this stage last year and we lost out to Linfield Swts,” said Murphy. “We were - down and we gave a penalty away and went - down. “We got a goal back and we threw everything at them to get an equaliser and we make a silly mistakes and they broke and made it -. “It was a bit gut-wrenching. We wanted to go on further in the competition and we are just hoping to go one step further this year and make it into the semi-finals.” Last season, the Swts challenged for promotion from the Ballymena and Provincial League Premier Division, but fell short at the end of a busy campaign. This season, they are, strictly speaking, unbeaten on the pitch and Murphy feels that is in no small part because of the summer signings made by manager Damien McStravick. “Last year, we knew we had a good team and we were playing good football,” said Murphy. “Towards the end of the season, it was just injuries and suspensions that killed us.“Our squad was a bit light and a few boys had to play with knocks. “During the summer, we made some brilliant signings thanks to Damien McStravick. He met boys who had played at a higher level and sold them on the ethos of the club. “We ended up with a smashing squad. “We kept all the players we had last year and we’ve added a bit more quality to it. “The new boys have all bought into what the club is about and they are enjoying their football.” This Saturday, St James’ bid to continue their incredible start to the season by dumping the holders out of the Steel and Sons Cup. However, Murphy is expecting a tough battle from the North Belfast side given that Newington went on to defeat Linfield Swts in last year’s Christmas Day final at Seaview. “They are a very dogged team and they work hard for each other. They are able to take their chances when they get them,” added the St James’ Swts assistant. “We also know they are the champions of this competition and they’re no going to let go of it easily. “We played them in pre-season and we won that game -, but they signed well after that game. “We know we are going to be up against it and it will be a real test. “We have to be at our best, but the way we are playing, I thinkwe show up on the day, we can win the game.” Newington will be without the suspended duo of Gavin Taggart and Kevin Bradley for Saturday’s clash while St James’ Swts are set to be at full strength for the quarter-final tie."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sf%e2%80%88asked to take","story":"ALLIANCE South Belfast MLA Paula Bradshaw has called for the removal of the election-style anti-Brexit posters erected by Sinn Féin in parts of the constituency.

As he was going off, McDonnell reacted to taunts and a plastic water bottle was thrown towards him.This led to punches thrown with several Newington players following him off the pitch as scuffles ensued. Things appeared to have calmed down with the players ing to the field, but the incident then sparked off again as McDonnell was being led to the dressing rooms. Again, players left the pitch, some it seemed were trying to calm the situation rather than join in, but the referee had seen enough, saying afterwards the chaotic scenes were out of control and he had no choice but to abandon the game.What happens now is up to the Co. Antrim FA. The draw for the semi-finals were made on Saturday with East Belfast awaiting the winner of Saturday’s gamethat is to be replayed or not.The Co. Antrim secretary was unavailable for comment this morning, but a decision is expected in the coming days.Click here to watch short Facebook video of the St James Swts v Newington game at https:www.facebook AndytownNews videos  "},{"url":null,"title":"chinabuilt titanic ii to set sail in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The company behind the plan, Blue Star Line, said the new ship will include all the latest safety and technical equipment to make it fit for the st Century seas. Originally the Titanic was owned by the White Star Line.Reports claim there will be nine decks and  staterooms that can accommodate , passengers and  crew members, the same as the Belfast original.First, second, and third class tickets will be available, just like the original and there will be a swimming pool, gymnasiums, and Turkish bath.However, the engines will be diesel-powered rather than coal fired but the iconic smoke stacks will remain. Clive Palmer, the Autralian business man behind the project said the maiden voyage will take travellers from Southampton to New York on the same route as the ill-fated  voyage. Then it will cruise around the world from Dubai hoping to \"enchant\" passengers with the style of the old world mixed with the new.It has been rumoured the ship will first lt anchor in , however, the company has said it is still in the early stages of planning and due diligence for the plan. “Millions have dreamt of sailing on her, seeing her in port and experiencing her unique majesty. Titanic II will be the ship where those dreams come true,” Clive Palmer said, thereported. A computer generated graphic of the new Titanic II.“The ship will follow the original journey, carrying passengers from Southampton to New York, but she will also circumnavigate the globe, inspiring and enchanting people while attracting unrivalled attention, intrigue and mystery in every port she visits.\"Speculation over the project has gathered pace over recent weeks after a series of announcements from Blue Star Line. On Tuesday it announced it would base its European office in Paris as opposed to London which will open in March .The photograph shows bodies in sacks piled three high on the deck of the CS Mackay Bennett, before being tipped overboard as the ships priest conducts a service. Photo issued by Henry Aldridge and Son.“It is of little use having a European headquarters outside Europe,’’ Mr Palmer said.Mr Palmer confirmed discussions were underway between project’s World Director and suppliers and consultants world-wide to get Titanic II underway as soon as possible.And last week the company announced the appointment of a European director - who had originally been part of the project in  - for the project who will be responsible for commercial negotiations, recruitment and training for Titanic II, the company said. At the end of September, the company released a new technical specications update in a YouTube video. Palmer was a former elected member of the Australian parliament and has announced he is standing again for election under the slogan \"Make Australia Great Again\". He has a dinosaur theme park in Australia and the Titanic project plan has been described as his \"pet project\". A second Titanic II is also being built in a theme park in China. However it will remain docked and not take on sailings.

As a result of this review, which included getting further legal opinion, NI Water now accepts that its interpretation of Article  was too broad and that it therefore had sought to ban certain activities that were not envisaged under the legislation, as currently drafted.\"Because the Assembly is still suspended due to the political stalemate, the legislative processes which are required to bring Northern Ireland into line with Britains practice in regard to hosepipe bans have not happened.Westminster could legislate in the absence of a ing Stormont.But given the pressure of Brexit on business, it is unlikely that Parliament will choose to do so in the near future."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland gears up for mega halloween celebrations send us your fancy dress pics","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

City deal packages bundle together additional funding and decision making powers aimed at driving growth in regions of the UK. The Chancellor made the first solid commitment to a city deal for Belfast in last years Budget, announcing negotiations on the deal were set to take place. Belfast City Council announced it has submitted a \"detailed, ambitious proposition\" and aims at securing £bn in investment from a number of sources. Mondays Budget will reveal whether Philip Hammond has agreed to stump up the £m being asked for as part of the deal. Chancellor Phillip Hammond is expected to make an announcement about Belfasts city deal on Monday If successful, it is projected the deal could deliver , jobs through a -year investment strategy, and through the £bn worth of public funding could leverage a further £bn of investment from the private sector. Where  has city deals  City deals were launched back in  with the aim of handing over more power to drive economic growth to cities across the UK.The first wave of the project saw deals for the eight largest cities outside of London, with this then being expanded to include the six cities with the highest population growth over the  years between  and . Originally confined to England, included among the aims of the deals were to allow the cities to \"take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area\" and to \"do what they think is best to help businesses grow\". After its initial roll-out, city deals were expanded out into the regions, and as of July last year there were  city deals in England, four in Scotland, and one in Wales. Is the deal exclusively for Belfast  If approved, the Belfast City Region Deal encompass five local authorities in the east of the province alongside Belfast City Council, as well as a number of educational institutions. Also included in the deal are Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council, Ards and North Down Borough Council, Belfast City Council, Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council, Mid and East Antrim Borough Council and Newry, Mourne and Down District Council. Queens University, Ulster University, Belfast politan College and other further education colleges are also included in the deal.  Belfast tables £bn ‘city deal’ proposal ahead of Chancellor’s BudgetThe envisaged deal, which has now been submitted to Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley, focuses on four key investment pillars – digital and innovation infrastructure tourism-led regeneration and skills and employability.Some of the measures included in the proposal are: the creation of a Global Innovation Institute the creation of further centres of innovation investment in digital connectivity investment in new tourist attractions and the extension of Belfasts Rapid Transport System. What about the city deal for Derry  At the time of the last Budget in , Philip Hammond was criticised by politicians from the north west for failing to mention a possible city deal for Derry, with SDLP leader Colum Eastwood labelling the omission a \"disgrace\". \"For too long Derry and the North West has been treated like the poor relation. Like second class citizens and we arent taking it,\" said Mr Eastwood at the time. In July, Chancellor Philip Hammond made the strongest commitment to date for a city deal for Northern Irelands second largest city. Mr Hammond said he was seeking to support productivity growth in Northern Ireland by inviting a \"a bid for a Derry-Londonderry city deal, an opportunity for the region to continue to drive forward economic growth and build an economy that works for everyone\".The document outlining the proposal for the city deal was submitted last month, with a delegation from Derry and Strabane District Council travelling to London. At a meeting of the council last week the Councils Chief Executive John Kelpie said signicant progress had already been made. The Derry Journal reports Mr Kelpie saying the Council would continue to \"lobby the Treasury and the relevant government departments to give a firm commitment\" and that formal negotiations could begin following an announcement in Mondays budget.Writing in the Derry Journal on Friday, Sinn Fein MP for Foyle Elisha McCallion said it would a \"major step forward\"a city deal was announced as part of the Budget.

There is no single obvious successor, but several potential contenders.The current parliamentary term is due to expire in , and the dpa news agency reported that Mrs Merkel said she will not seek re-election.She currently governs Germany in a “grand coalition” of what traditionally have been the country’s biggest parties – the CDU, Baia’s conservative Christian Social Union, and the centre-left Social Democrats. Her fourth-term government only took office in March, but has become notorious for squabbling.An election in the central state of Hesse saw both the CDU and the Social Democrats lose signicant ground amid gains for both the Green party and the far-right Alternative for Germany party. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen and health minister Jens Spahn, arrive for a CDU party’s leaders meeting in Berlin Mrs Merkel’s party managed an unimpressive win, narrowly salvaging a majority for its regional governing coalition with the Greens in Hesse.The debacle followed a battering in a state election in Baia two weeks ago for the CSU and the Social Democrats.Citing unidentied party sources, the dpa reported that Mrs Merkel told an ongoing CDU leadership meeting that she is prepared to step down as party leader but intends to remain chancellor. The mass-circulation daily Bild also reported that she said she will not run again as party leader.That is a major concession for Mrs Merkel, who for years has insisted that the chancellor should also be party leader. However, there is precedent for splitting the two jobs.Mrs Merkel’s predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, stepped down as leader of his centre-left Social Democrats in  as his government struggled, but remained chancellor until he narrowly lost an election  months later. Helmut Schmidt, West Germany’s chancellor from  to , never led the Social Democrats.“The CDU faces a turning point,” Mike Mohring, a regional party leader from eastern Germany, told Welt television. “Angela Merkel knows best what to do, and now she has decided. And that demands respect.”He said that it is important to avoid “long personnel debates” and restore people’s confidence in the CDU as a governing party.Mrs Merkel dragged the CDU to the political centre in her years as leader, dropping military conscription, introducing benefits encouraging fathers to look after their young children and abruptly accelerating the shutdown of Germany’s nuclear power plants following Japan’s Fukushima disaster in .She allowed large numbers of asylum-seekers into Germany in , many fleeing the fighting in Syria, declaring that “we will manage it”, before gradually pivoting to a more restrictive approach. That decision has led to lasting tensions in her conservative Union bloc, particularly with the CDU’s Baia-only sister party, the CSU, and helped the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party gain support.The Social Democrats’ leader, Andrea Nahles, demanded a “clear, binding timetable” for implementing government projects before the federal coalition faces an already-agreed upon mid-term review next autumn."},{"url":null,"title":"brandnew passenger jet plunges into sea with nearly 200 people","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process. But the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gold for James at cyclo cross race in Belfast  ","story":"A LARGE number of Dromara riders competed in round five of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross series in Musgrave park on Sunday, the event organised by VC Glendale.It was a rainy start to the day, but it did not dampen the spirits of Dromararsquos young riders.Hugh Hetherington, Tom Cowan and Anna Armstrong were the first to take to the course in the U- race.

It is vitally important the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site is used for the benefit of the community,he continued.ldquoAny future planning applications will involve a consultation process that enables the public to have their say on the future development.The Downpatrick councillor suggested that given the current parking and traffic flow issues at Edward Street, there was a need for an ultra-modern primary school in the town to continue to provide a high standard of childrenrsquos education.He declared: ldquoI believe the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site would be ideal for a new school development and will be writing to the Education Authority to ask that they investigate the sitersquos potential for such a development.ldquoI will also be asking Newry, Mourne and Down Council to review options for this site as it could also be ideal for other community facilities.A spokesman for the diocese of Down and Connor confirmed on Monday that the former St Patrickrsquos Boys Primary School site will be placed on the market for sale.He added: ldquoThe diocesan Trustees are legally bound to act in the best interests of the charity and to consider all offers made through the public market process.ldquoIn the case of sales of former school sites, the diocesan Trustees are required toa substantial percentage of the sale price to the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.A number of people have taken to social media in the wake of news that the former school site is to be sold and expressed concern about the impact its redevelopment could have on an already heavily congested part of the town.Several have suggested a new school should be built on the site, while others believe its redevelopment could have problems securing planning permission given the topography of this part of the town and traffic congestion in nearby Edward Street.A number of people said they would not be in favour of any form of retail development at the former school site..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Staff being followed home by unruly teenagers  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick have revealed that some members of staff have been followed home by unruly teenagers who are terrorising the town centre with their behaviour.The worrying revelation came during a meeting held last week to discuss mounting concern about increasing anti-social behaviour in St Patrickrsquos Square, the Grove shopping centre area and other parts of the town.Within  hours of last weekrsquos meeting concluding, a firework was thrown at a customer as he left a hot food bar in St Patrickrsquos Square, narrowly missing him.Business owners fear someone is going to have to be seriously injured or worse before the ongoing trouble is addressed.They say the anti-social behaviour cannot be allowed to continue in the area, or in any other part of Downpatrick, and insist there must be immediate action to be bring the trouble to an end.Last weekrsquos meeting between local police, business owners and elected representatives was organised by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who has revealed there were a number of frank exchanges, with all those in attendance describing the talks as ldquoworthwhile.He also confirmed another session involving the parties is due to be held in mid-November.A businessman said it was ldquoentirely unsatisfactory that people who were trying to do a dayrsquos work should be terrorised by  and  year-old children operating outside the control of their parents and the police.ldquoIt is now getting dficult to recruit staff in Downpatrick town centre, he revealed.ldquoWe do not have these problems in Newcastle or Ardglass. Self-employed retailers pay tax and rates in an expectation that the government and Newry, Mourne and Down Council will ensure that the environment in our town centres is suitable for business and attractive to customers. We expect this situation to be turned around rapidly and not deteriorate further.During the meeting, business owners complained about having their staff harassed and having to close early, losing trade due to anti-social behaviour.Vehicles in the car park at the rear of the Grove shopping centre have been damaged, with business owners and local residentsrsquo group representatives expressing concern that police were not doing more to help bring about prosecutions.Residentsrsquo group members complained that they could no longer let their children play near the Grove or St Patrickrsquos Square, an area which they argued should be a major attraction in the town for adults and children alike.Fears were also expressed that this part of Downpatrick was now becoming ldquoout of bounds for the decent people in the town in the evenings.Cllr Enright said local police welcomed the opportunity to listen first-hand to what businesses and residentsrsquo associations had to say and agreed to meet met with them again next month to track progress in dealing with these issues.He also thanked South Down MLA Colin McGrath for attending the meeting and fellow MLA Emma Rogan for sending her apologies and confirming she will be at the November meeting.ldquoIt was clear that senior police officers were not aware of the scale of the problems in the town over the past nine months, Cllr Enright said.ldquoStatistics of reported crime did not reflect what was going on, with business owners surprised at the low number of prosecutions.ldquoThere appears to be a systemic problem in dealing with youth offending in the Public Prosecutions Service which insists on up to five repetitions of so-called lsquoyouth engagementrsquo by the police before considering bringing forward a prosecution.Cllr Enright suggested this left some of the worst culprits with little respect for or fear of the police.He confirmed that MLAs have been asked to raise this particular issue with the PPS, alongside concerns of people waiting up to  minutes to get through on the PSNIrsquos  number to report incidents.He said concern was also expressed about how reports of assaults, vandalism and intimidation were followed though, with some business owners keen for police to search young people whom they suspect of carrying fireworks.He added: ldquoThere was also criticism of the lsquoinvisibilityrsquo of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos community safety wardens, with some suggestions that robust action against anti-social behaviour issues at the Model Farm area may have been partly responsible for transferring the trouble to the town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traffic ‘worse than ever’ amid calls for filter lane  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to address mounting concern about traffic snarl-ups at a busy junction on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Local people and politicians have been campaigning for a new filter lane at the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road which is dealing with a signicant increase in traffic at peak periods.Vehicles can be queued from the junction as far back as Bishops Brae in the morning with the upsurge attributed to the number of organisations now based at the Downshire Civic Centre.The public sector campus is home to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the PSNI, Housing Executive and Fire and Rescue Service. The Downe Hospital is also part of the sprawling estate.Mrs Olwyn McColl, who lives at Vianstown Heights, says there has been a major increase in traffic using the junction over the past year and is urging roads officials to address the problem.She says there is available land to provide a filter lane which has the potential to signicantly reduce tailbacks.ldquoThe problem is getting worse and sitting in a tailback, especially in the mornings when parents are taking children to school and people are heading to work, can be very frustrating, she said.ldquoDue to the current layout of the junction, drivers wishing to turn left at the junction have to wait until the traffic in front of them clears. A new filter lane would help reduce waiting times.Mrs McColl said it would appear that an increasing number of drivers heading from the Newcastle direction in the morning were now using the Ballynoe and Bishops Brae roads, which was contributing to the congestion.ldquoThe problem is  times worse than it ever was, there is no doubt about that, she continued. ldquoThings are bad now and they could get worse when the nearby new civic amenity site opens early next year.ldquoMany of my neighbours share my concern and it would be greatroads officials could use the land which is available to provide a new filter lane. It would make such a dference.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he shared the frustration of those campaigning for the filter lane which has not yet been delivered.ldquoIn addition to the nearby Downshire Civic Centre, we have a large shopping centre, a nursery and primary school, leisure facility and very busy MOT centre which is all adding to the build-up of traffic at peak periods, he said.ldquoWhile I am delighted Downpatrick has a major public sector campus, we need to ensure the roads system can cope with the additional volume of traffic its provision has generated. An important step would be upgrading the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road.Cllr Curran believes a filter lane would not cost a signicant amount of money to provide and would go some way towards easing the current problem.ldquoThis particular junction is extremely busy in the morning, with a long tail back of vehicles a common occurrence. The creation of a filter lane allowing drivers wishing to turn left out of the Ballynoe Road would help reduce congestion, he said. lsquoThe provision of a new filter lane is a no brainer.Cllr Curran said that while roads officials previously identied a scheme to provide a new filter lane, they subsequently decided that, due to the close proximity of the Glebetown Drive housing area, a new slip road would cause ldquoroad safety issues.He added: ldquoI firmly believe that the time has come to revisit this particular proposal.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world.

They were being trained at Ballykinler camp and they built huts and they also dug trenches for practising for trench warfare.“We know of several soldiers who were doing that – a guy called Tommy Ervine, from Belfast, recalls building huts and digging trenches.“And the great thing is, when the hut was removed we found a lot of artefacts in the sand underneath that will now tell the story of the hut.”The artefacts range from First World War era to when the camp was used to intern prisoners during the Irish War of Independence, American GIs during the Second World War, and subsequent soldiers who were stationed there during Northern Ireland’s Troubles.Mr King said they are also trying to trace relatives of the soldiers who owned the items.“We have got a dog tag – every soldier was given two dog tags and somebody lost this one, a fellow called Daidson, so we are trying to trace this fellow. We think it may have been from the end of the First World War,” he said.“We have ious pieces of unorm, one which says its from the Royal Ulster Rles, a badge, matchboxes, a string for cleaning a rle barrel, pipes, mess tin and a mug.“We have got quite a lot of interesting things which tell you about the everyday le of the soldiers.”NI Water admits sweeping hosepipe ban had no lawful basis – months after rejecting News Letter report Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

This is what delivery looks like. No gimmicks. No grandstanding. Just Ministers getting on with the work.#It sounded very positive. It was meant to. It was a direct riposte tothose who had dared to suggest that the working relationship between the DUP and Sinn Fein was ‘built on the pretence that all was well between them’.    The RHI Inquiry report is unlikely to do Arlene Foster or the DUP any favours Yet, just  days later – January ,  – the pretence of the good relationship and the pretence behind the joint article was blown apart by Martin McGuinness’s resignation letter: ‘At times I have stretched and challenged republicans and nationalists in my determination to reach out to our unionist neighbours. It is a source of deep personal frustration that those efforts have not always been reciprocated by unionist leaders. At times, they have been met with outright rejection. The equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP. ‘Apart from the negative attitude to nationalism and to the Irish identity and culture, there has been a shameful disrespect towards many other sections of our community. Women, the LGBT community and ethnic minorities have all felt this prejudice. And for those who wish to live their lives through the medium of Irish, elements in the DUP have exhibited the most crude and crass bigotry ... I am tendering my resignation ... In the available period Sinn Fein will not nominate to the position of deputy first minister. We now need an election to allow the people to make their own judgment on these issues democratically at the ballot box.’Irrespective of what has emerged during the inquiry and irrespective of the findings and recommendations of the final report, one fact is certain: RHI brought down the government of Northern Ireland. Within a couple of weeks of the story breaking it became clear that Sinn Fein was angling for an election: that’s why McGuinness’s letter led with republicans ‘stretching’ themselves for peace, and accused the DUP of pursuing a ‘negative attitude to nationalism.’ He chose, as one of his last political acts, to press the nuclear button: an extraordinary thing to do for someone who had put so much personal investment into the entire process. It’s worth bearing in mind, too, that Sinn Fein hasn’t emerged from the inquiry with clean hands. Having boasted about ‘getting on with the work’ and ‘delivery,’ it does seem odd that they didn’t appear to know all that much about how the RHI scheme was actually being delivered and whether the costings etc had been properly assessed and understood. Perhapsthey had insisted on proper collective responsibility and accountability before signing off on Executive formation with the DUP in ,  and , it might have prevented calamity on this scale.For the DUP, of course, RHI has been a nightmare: and they will be very worried about the report. That’s why a deal to reboot the Executive won’t be struck before the publication of that report unless, that is, Foster is ‘encouraged’ to step down as leader in the meantime. It will not be possible for her to take the role of first minister while the shadow of the report hangs over her head. Only the softest, most benign of reports, could save her political skin at this point and the evidence we have heard during the sitting of the inquirysuggests that the report won’t do her or the DUP any favours.I’m aware that there are people across the DUP who have been wondering how to handle the ‘Arlene problem.’ She knows it, too. But here’s the thing: last February’s potential dealfoundered on the Irish language. I have heard nothing since then to convince me that there has been a change of thinking within the DUP on that issue: andthere hasn’t been a change, then what does a new leader bring to the table  That’s not to say that something isn’t possible but it would require massive compromises from both sides and I’m not sure what those would be. Compromise risks vote loss and it would be a very brave successor to Foster who would begin his leadership with that kind of compromise.She’s in an awful position: with very little to do now but wait for the findings of the RHI report –knowing that it could be catastrophic for the DUP. And her position isn’t helped by the fact that she and her MPs are having to issue regular warnings to Theresa May about anything which could undermine the Union as the UK leaves the EU.

That will be a dficult speech. She knows it. The party know it. Probably the most dficult speech a DUP leader has had to make since the decision was taken to cut a power-sharing deal with Sinn Fein in .A final personal reflection. Having watched and written about all of this for the past  years – and I was based at the Assembly for some of that time – it would take an awful lot to convince me that we should trust anyone hereto deliver good, effective, responsible, collective, accountable, thought-through government.try catch     .               ..

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There is no single obvious successor, but several potential contenders.The current parliamentary term is due to expire in , and the dpa news agency reported that Mrs Merkel said she will not seek re-election.She currently governs Germany in a ldquogrand coalition of what traditionally have been the countryrsquos biggest parties ndash the CDU, Baiarsquos conservative Christian Social Union, and the centre-left Social Democrats.Her fourth-term government only took office in March, but has become notorious for squabbling.An election in the central state of Hesse saw both the CDU and the Social Democrats lose signicant ground amid gains for both the Green party and the far-right Alternative for Germany party.German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen and health minister Jens Spahn, arrive for a CDU partyrsquos leaders meeting in Berlin Mrs Merkelrsquos party managed an unimpressive win, narrowly salvaging a majority for its regional governing coalition with the Greens in Hesse.The debacle followed a battering in a state election in Baia two weeks ago for the CSU and the Social Democrats.Citing unidentied party sources, the dpa reported that Mrs Merkel told an ongoing CDU leadership meeting that she is prepared to step down as party leader but intends to remain chancellor.The mass-circulation daily Bild also reported that she said she will not run again as party leader.That is a major concession for Mrs Merkel, who for years has insisted that the chancellor should also be party leader. However, there is precedent for splitting the two jobs.Mrs Merkelrsquos predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, stepped down as leader of his centre-left Social Democrats in  as his government struggled, but remained chancellor until he narrowly lost an election  months later.Helmut Schmidt, West Germanyrsquos chancellor from  to , never led the Social Democrats.ldquoThe CDU faces a turning point, Mike Mohring, a regional party leader from eastern Germany, told Welt television. ldquoAngela Merkel knows best what to do, and now she has decided. And that demands respect.He said that it is important to avoid ldquolong personnel debates and restore peoplersquos confidence in the CDU as a governing party.Mrs Merkel dragged the CDU to the political centre in her years as leader, dropping military conscription, introducing benefits encouraging fathers to look after their young children and abruptly accelerating the shutdown of Germanyrsquos nuclear power plants following Japanrsquos Fukushima disaster in .She allowed large numbers of asylum-seekers into Germany in , many fleeing the fighting in Syria, declaring that ldquowe will manage it, before gradually pivoting to a more restrictive approach.That decision has led to lasting tensions in her conservative Union bloc, particularly with the CDUrsquos Baia-only sister party, the CSU, and helped the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party gain support.The Social Democratsrsquo leader, Andrea Nahles, demanded a ldquoclear, binding timetable for implementing government projects before the federal coalition faces an already-agreed upon mid-term review next autumn..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Angela Merkel ready to step down as party leader  u reports article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In factyou’d said to me  days ago there would be tourists in Portadown town centre I’d still have laughed.   The ghostly figure to the left of News Letter reporter Graeme Cousins However, last week I was one of nearly  tourists walking the streets of the Co Armagh town as part of a ghost tour organised by Portadown Heritage Tours, a branch of the local Orange Order.And it was to be a ghost tour with a rather appropriate ending ... when a ghostly apparition joined the touring party for a final snap.As the tour came to an end our guide Lisa Partridge gathered us together for a group photo close to the site of the  massacre at the Bann bridge. She remarked that it was the site in Portadown where a ghost sighting was most likely.She took the snap and I thought nothing more of it until Lisa shared the photo the next day.   An artists impression of the  massacre As I scanned the image my eyes were drawn to a figure just behind me in the image that hadn’t been there when the photo was being taken.In the space between the two ladies positioned fth and sixth from the right, what looks to be a lady in profile view, with her hair pulled back, can be seen lurking in the background.I don’t believe in ghosts and my explanation would be that it’s a coincidental arrangement of leaves at the fence behind us, but all the same it did send a few chills up my spine the first time I saw it.Others in the office agreed that it did look a lot like a human form, and was certainly a lot sharper than some of the blurred images often attached to ghost stories.   St Marks Church in Portadownthe spot where the last man was hanged in the town Lisa said: “It wouldn’t be the first time a ghost has shown up in a picture taken in that area.“We took a picture last year under the bridge down at the Bann river and we picked out what looked like the outline of a mother holding the hand of her child.“It fits in with the  rebellion stories and the massacre that took place at the bridge here.Road closed after serious collision Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“We tell people that this area is where they’re most likely to get a sighting.”   Tour guides Ashleigh Todd and Lisa Partridge The -year-old explained how she got involved in historical tours of Portadown: “I’ve always had an interest in history, but was a bit wary of finding work after a history degree, so I did business studies instead.“I came to the heritage tours from a retail background. The idea of heritage tours is we want to move the Orange Order forward.”Portadown Heritage Tours was set up with the help of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund.Lisa, a member of WLOL No  in Edenderry, said: “It’s about community tourism. It’s local people telling local stories about places people walk past every day but don’t realise the signicance of them.“Our normal three tours are a town tour, a Drumcree tour and then the tours ofhall.“Through the history we were gathering from the other tours, ghost stories started appearing. The majority surrounded the  massacre at the Bann bridge during the  rebellion.“For that there was actual documentation from witnesses about the apparitions.“When you start looking for something it’s everywhere. People started coming forward with ghost stories.“We ran a ghost tour last year as a pilot and it keeps growing.“We’ve started getting into more of the stories this year.“Anyone can claim they’ve seen a ghost, so we try to seethere’s an historical event that can be linked to the sighting orthere’s been any documentation of sightings in that area, in newspapers or from other sources.”She added: “Whenever I go on holidays I always try to do a ghost tour. You get dferent ones where people get into character, but for this tour I just wanted to strip it all back and focus on the stories. “There won’t be people jumping out at you or we won’t be embellishing the stories to make them more scary.“It’s suitable for all ages, though there’s some walking involved to get to the locations around the town.”The -stop tour begins at Carleton Street Orange Hall and finishes at the site of the  massacre at the River Bann. Askedshe had ever seen a ghost herself, Lisa said: “There’s one in Carleton Street Orange Hall. I haven’t seen it personally but I’ve heard it.“It’s the ghost of William John Locke . There’s times it’s just been me and another girl in the office and % we’ve heard footsteps going up and down the stairs.“There’s times you feel like someone is watching you.“That said, I wouldn’t say it’s a scary place to work.”Askedthere had been any objections within the local order to running a ghost tour, she said: “Everyone involved with the heritage tours are members of the loyal order. “Our ethos was that the Orange Order needs to move forward, and put out the hand of friendship.“To do this we’ve opened up the doors of the hall and invited people in to come and see. It’s not an Orange museum but it’s living history.“There’s been no objection from the Orange Order to the ghost tours, in fact some of them link back to the Orange Order. As well as Locke, the last man hanged in Portadown was an Orangeman. The  rebellion also has big links to the Protestant culture, there are memorials at the site.“While there are Orange links this tour is very much cross community. The people who are coming have been   from both sides of the community.“We’ve had a lot of people coming from the west – Tyrone, Dungannon.“We don’t have a set cost yet, we just ask for donation only. Things are still at an early stage and we want to add more stories as well.”Portadown Heritage Tours which is attached to the Orange Order have been running tours of the town for the past  months.They began running tours of Carleton Street Orange Hall as well as tours of the town and Drumcree. The ghost tour came about as a result of information uncovered on their other tours.The final ghost tour of the month takes place on Tuesday at pm from Carleton Street Orange Hall.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £.

On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.
