It has also been switched from law to guidance in Northern Ireland.However, people are still required to isolate for at least one week in Scotland and six days in Wales. Outside of the UK, isolation duration periods vary from four days in Norway to 10 days in Germany. Dr Irwin-Knoester said a seven-day isolation period \u0027should be safe\u0027 in almost all cases, but five days \u0027strikes an acceptable balance\u0027 between the infectiousness of the virus and the desire to get back to normal.Dr Irwin-Knoester is expected to tell the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases: \u0027The decisions being made by different countries around the world to shorten the period of isolation for Omicron infections are partly based on evidence from modelling.\u0027And she noted the move also takes account \u0027of the fact that Omicron is causing less severe disease, and fewer hospitalisations and deaths\u0027.She said: \u0027It is a way of returning to something like normal life and accept transmission of this less dangerous Omicron variant.\u0027From the evidence so far, I am not convinced that a person is likely to be infectious for a shorter period of time with Omicron as they would have been with previous variants.\u0027Dr Irwin-Knoester said a maximum of seven days isolation \u0027should be safe in almost all cases of infection\u0027.But a five-day isolation period \u0027strikes an acceptable balance between the infectiousness of the virus and what most communities are willing to accept going forward, especially after around two years of restrictions in many cases\u0027, she added.However, Dr Irwin-Knoester noted that people still suffering from respiratory symptoms, such as coughing and sneezing, after seven days should continue to isolate for 10 to 14 days.And those severely unwell with the virus often \u0027shed for longer\u0027, while immunocompromised people can transmit the virus for months.Dr Irwin-Knoester also warned that a new variant \u0027could throw everything up in the air\u0027, especially if it causes more serious illness or escapes the protection offered by Covid vaccines. \u0027If it is a new variant that makes us seriously ill, I would recommend returning to longer periods of isolation – with seven days as a minimum,\u0027 she added.In England, the legal requirement to self-isolate after testing positive came to an end on February 24, although people are still advised to do so. The requirement to wear face masks also came to an end on that date, while free tests are being scrapped from April 1.           "},{"url":null,"title":"BuzzFeed shareholders urged CEO Jonah Peretti shut ENTIRE news operation","story":"Share this articleBuzzFeed investors have pushed CEO Jonah Peretti to shut down newsroomLeaked Audio: BuzzFeed Staffers React to News Cuts at Internal Meeting"},{"url":null,"title":"Countries queuing trade deals UK says Minister","story":"Share this article ‘We do ourselves down, the rest of the world thinks the UK is amazing and they want to work with a trusted partner.’The minister, whose ancestors moved from the Isle of Mull in Scotland to Canada where her father was born, will wear a suit she has made herself from her family’s ancient hunting tartan.‘It\u0027ll just be lovely to be the person who moves us into that next stage,’ she said.Mrs Trevelyan, who has nicknamed the new deal ‘Canada 2.0’, said the continuity trade agreement rolled over from Britain’s member of the EU was ‘quite old fashioned’ and ‘not really very digital trade focused’.‘This is an opportunity to take it to a much, much higher level,’ she added. ‘Looking at things like digital trade, which is such an important area.By removing red tape, Mrs Trevelyan said the agreement would help ‘strip away costs for the consumer’ and ‘strip away cost and effort for business’.British officials believe thousands of smaller firms will be encouraged to start trading with Canada if barriers can be removed, such as by simplifying paperworkMrs Trevelyan said the new agreement would open access for British firms to Canadian government procurement contracts, which will be ‘really big business for some of our really important construction and industrial service partners’.‘There\u0027ll be some really chunky stuff in there to discuss, which will be good and they\u0027re really up for it, she continued.‘That\u0027s why they\u0027re top of my pile because they\u0027ve really leaned in and said we want to move to the next phase.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillA number of private schools in south Dublin plan to enrol students with learning disabilities who have been assessed as requiring special classes for the first time.Until now it has been Department of Education policy not to fund special classes in private schools.However, under an agreement with the Spiritans – founders of Blackrock College, St Michael’s College on Merrion Road, St Mary’s College in Rathmines and Templeogue College in Dublin - special classes will be funded in these schools as long as qualifying students are enrolled without having to pay fees.The agreement also includes fee-charging primary schools attached to these schools including Willow Park, St Michael’s Junior and St Mary’s Junior schools.Special classes typically provide education for children with additional needs in mainstream schools.These smaller classes - typically six students to one teacher and two special needs assistants - cater to the needs of young people who require more specialised support and might not cope in a regular classroom.The department’s policy of not funding special classes for private schools has been a significant barrier for students with additional needs in the south Dublin area where there is a high concentration of fee-charging schools.The department previously defended the practice on the basis that access to special classes should be available on “the basis of children’s need rather than their ability to pay”.The Spiritan Education Trust agreement with the Department of Education means these students will be exempt from fees under new access routes. In addition, the trust has pledged to make land available on its school campuses to provide special schools, as required.It says this will be done by way of long-term licensing arrangements which avoid any site costs being incurred by the department.The initial focus aims to maximise opportunities for special education at the Templeogue College - which is not fee-paying - as part of an overall development of the campus.This will include a four-classroom base for about 24 students with special educational needs at the college.In addition, there are plans to relocate Cheeverstown School, a special school currently located on a temporary site in Templeogue with about 20 pupils, to the college campus.Enrolment priorityIn terms of special classes at fee-charging schools, the Spiritan Trust has agreed that priority enrolment will be determined by educational authorities based on pupils’ needs, rather than having a sibling or a parent who was a past-pupil.More broadly, Minister for Education Norma Foley and Minister of State for Special Education Josepha Madigan have announced details of the expansion of special education places in Dublin and Cork, with a particular focus on the 202223 school year.The special education system has been under acute pressure for some time with many families saying that they have been unable to access school places which meet their children’s needs.The expanded provision in Dublin and Cork includes:* An additional six places for children at Casa Caterina School, Cabra for the 202223 school-year* An additional six places at Danú Community Special School, Dublin 15* An additional seven places at Our Lady of Hope School, Crumlin* A new special school in Rochestown, Cork that will provide for the enrolment of about 30 children with autism and complex learning needs during the 202223 school year* Carraigaline Community Special School will expand by 16 places to an enrolment of 48 for the 202223 school year* St Killian’s Special School, Mayfield, will expand to provide for the enrolment of 18 additional students in September, 2022Ms Madigan said planning is also underway for the provision of new school buildings for a number of special schools in Dublin under the patronage of St. Michael’s House. This will provide additional capacity in both the north and south Dublin areas.“At this time of year, many families are applying for school places for their children. It can be a period of anxiety,” Ms Madigan said.“Today’s announcement is about saying to families that we understand the pressures you are facing, we are on your side, and we are committed to ensuring that as many places as possible are available.”"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"In Richard Nairn\u0026rsquos second book on the Irish coastline, he has bad news to shareStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"hse awaiting niac advice on fourth vaccine dose for vulnerable people reid","story":"Paul Reid has called on those who have not received a booster to do so now. Photograph: PAThe director general of the Health Service Executive (HSE) Paul Reid has said that the executive is awaiting advice from the National Immunisation Advisory Council (Niac) to start dispensing a fourth dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to older and vulnerable people.“We’re ready, we haven’t dismantled the structures”, said Mr Reid on Wednesday.Mr Reid defended Niac saying that it had served the country well during the pandemic with its advice on timing and sequencing of vaccines. Ireland had done very well because of the advice from Niac and the HSE must act on the best evidence, he said.Mr Reid told Newstalk’s Pat Kenny Show it was important the 720,000 people who had not yet received their booster because they had Covid do so now. He encouraged parents to have their children vaccinated as it had been proven that the vaccine provided the best protection against serious illness from the virus.The current wave of the virus, while not causing illness as severe as previous variants, was still having an impact on the health service in terms of flow, he said, as elderly patients could not be discharged to nursing homes if there was an outbreak. At present there is an average of seven cases of Covid per nursing home.There are also 4,300 health service staff absent from work because of Covid and a further 1,000 staff in nursing homes, he said. “We are seeing increasingly crippling effects of Covid.”Mr Reid said he could not be clearer in his advice that people should wear masks on public transport and in congregated settings, and they should also continue hand washing and social distancing. “I would encourage people to get back to basics,” said Mr Reid.IsolatingMeanwhile, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly is self isolating with flu-like symptoms and will miss engagements he was due to attend on Wednesday.Mr Donnelly has tested negative for Covid-19 but bowed out of an event at Connelly Hospital in Dublin as a precaution.He was due to attend the launch of a planned new RCSI Education and Research Centre on the campus. He also planned to bring legislation to the Dáil.Mr Donnelly said on Twitter: “Was looking forward bringing the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill before the House today. “This is a critical and historic piece of legislation. “It will introduce a regulatory framework for AHR and will pave the way for publicly funded treatments such as IVF.”However, he added: “Unfortunately, I have flu-like symptoms. “Have tested negative for Covid but am isolating at home in line with public health advice - and will continue to do so for 48 hours after my symptoms have resolved.”He encouraged people any symptoms of Covid-19, “even mild ones” to isolate and follow the expert advice on the HSE website. He shared the link to the advice:Minister for Justice Helen McEntee will not attend the British - Irish intergovernmental conference to be held on Wednesday after tesing positive for Covid.

Photograph: EPAAndy RainMPs at Westminster voted on Tuesday night to reinstate the requirement for a US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of proposed new British immigration laws.A majority of 298 MPs to 216 voted to back the UK government’s challenge to an amendment introduced in the House of Lords, which would have exempted Northern Ireland from the legislation.The human rights NGO the Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ) condemned the move, which it said was “unworkable and risks a hard border for many non-British and non-Irish citizens in Border communities who have been able to freely cross the Border to date”.The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney, said the decision was “regrettable” and “contrary to the approach that UK and Irish governments have supported for many years to protect free movement on the island of everyone.“Our concern on this has been communicated clearly but has been ignored.”Responding to Mr Coveney’s tweet on social media, the Northern Secretary, Brandon Lewis, said there would be “no controls on the Border.“UK and Irish citizens will continue to be able to travel freely. This new ETA requirement is about protecting the Common Travel Area from abuse.“Our commitment to the Common Travel Area is absolute, as seen throughout the pandemic,” he said.Under the Nationalities and Borders Bill, EU citizens who are not Irish will be required to apply online for pre-travel clearance –known as Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) –before entering the UK, including when crossing the Border into Northern Ireland.It will also apply to citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA) living in the State, which includes people from Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.Non-British or non-Irish citizens from other countries, outside the EUEEA, which previously did not require a visa to enter the UK, will now need an ETA.The Bill is part of a wider, post-Brexit overhaul of the UK’s immigration laws and includes provisions on asylum seekers, nationality and immigration control.The amendment on Northern Ireland was one of a number of changes made to the Bill in the House of Lords which were overturned by a Commons vote on Tuesday. The Bill will now return to the Lords.The oppositionSpeaking in favour of the amendment during the debate, the Alliance MP Stephen Farry said the ETA was “essentially unworkable in the context of the island of Ireland” and urged the UK government to listen to the opposition of their Irish counterparts and to the “considerable concern” about it in Northern Ireland.He said current movements on the island of Ireland were “not a threat to UK security” but it could place people who previously enjoyed freedom of movement across the Border in “legal jeopardy”.It could also affect cross-Border tourism, he said, and with ten of thousands of cross-Border journeys taking place every day, it “could become fairly absurd” in Border areas where roads cross both jurisdictions.The Conservative MP Tom Pursglove said the UK government was clear there would be “no controls on the Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland”.However, he said exempting the Border from the ETA requirement could result in “an unacceptable gap in UK border security” and that it was important “all iniduals, except British and Irish citizens . . . continue to enter in line with the UK’s immigration framework to protect both the UK immigration system and the common travel area from abuse”.Mr Pursglove said the UK was “entitled to introduce and change its own requirements in the interest of securing the UK border” and would continue to liaise with authorities in Dublin on issues of border security in relation to the Common Travel Area.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"british and irish relationship should be based on equal respect says starmer","story":"Labour leader Keir Starmer speaks to the Labour Party Irish Society Annual St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre.

You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there.

If you back the Nationality and Borders Bill, Mr Farron told the Commons, “you are voting for deaths in the Channel!” - and though Andrew Mitchell, leader of a doomed Conservative rebellion, didn\u0027t go that far, he agreed it was unkind and expensive.Rather than processing refugees in Albania, he said, it would be cheaper to “house them at the Ritz and send the under-18s to Eton”. And wouldn\u0027t that mess with the Left\u0027s head? They might think twice about open borders if the children were groomed to become the next Tory prime minister.To defend this “utterly obscene” piece of legislation (to quote a one-star review by the SNP), the Government sent in the lovely but unexciting Thomas Pursglove. As the MP for Corby, land of the trouser press, rattled through the 54 amendments sent by the Lords in a tone that sounded, perversely, like he was enjoying himself, Mitchell wandered the backbenches trying to foment a mutiny among those still awake - before plopping down insolently in the middle of the Chamber, waggling his red socked-foot provocatively like a red rag to a Bill.Pursglove finished. The rebellion began, an orgy of cross-bench agreement that Tory liberals and opposition socialists pretended to find surprising, but they\u0027re always of one mind on borders. Let asylum seekers work, said John McDonnell (that way he can tax \u0027em, the crafty old commie). Process them in the UK, said David Davis, where it is humane. Australia tried offshoring, said the SNP, and it didn\u0027t work. Oh yes it did, said Thomas Hunt of Ipswich, noting that the number of those dying at sea fell. Oh no it didn\u0027t, said Double-D, claiming that the scheme was judged costly and dangerous, adding that, in his view, what actually made a difference was “pushing back” the refugees - a policy the Left thinks is tantamount to murder.So, what are we supposed to do?When someone knocks on your door, say the wets, and begs for help, you don\u0027t turn them away. Amen. But if they pay a thug to break in via a downstairs window, says the Government, you\u0027ve a right to complain.We need “control!” barked Sir John Hayes: yes to safe routes, no to the illegal. But while this Bill clamps down on criminals, it doesn\u0027t actually provide for new safe routes, which is akin to sticking a sign on your lawn that reads “All Welcome!”, while covering the garden path with mines and barbed wire.Mitchell noted that over 80 per cent of those entering Britain “illicitly” in 2021 came from countries that have no legal route. They\u0027re not dodging the forms. They\u0027re rolling the dice.The amendments were defeated, and the Government will be labelled heartless for trying to enforce the law, which is its basic job. “Disraeli observed,” said Sir John, “that it is easier to be critical than correct”. How true. But if only the correct course of action, namely protecting the border, didn\u0027t leave one feeling just a little bit crummy.More from News\u0026#39Major incident\u0026#39 declared at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park after \u0026#39release of gas\u0026#39Russia-Ukraine latest news: Russia accuses US of hindering peace talks and dragging out war as \u0026#39long as possible\u0026#39 Sir David Amess murder trial live: Court told of terror suspect Ali Harbi Ali\u0026#39s \u0026#39self-satisfaction\u0026#39 after stabbingUkraine\u0026#39s ambassador comes to Boris Johnson\u0026#39s defence over Brexit comparison rowSpring Statement latest news: Tory MPs issue last-ditch plea to Rishi Sunak toPink Moon 2022: when it peaks in the UK and other full moon datesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"incident declared olympic park release gas results number casualties1","story":"A significant number of emergency service personnel have responded to the incident at the Olympic parkA large number of emergency services personnel are responding to an incident at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, the London Ambulance Service (LAS) have announced.The park authorities said on Twitter that the incident is related to the release of a gas and that there are a number of casualties being treated for breathing difficulties.The tweet said: There are a number of casualties with breathing difficulties being treated by @Ldn-Ambulance.LAS added on Twitter: We are responding to an incident at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and have a number of resources on scene.

The Governmentaposs lawyers in written submission argued that there is no principle of common law stopping ministers or officials communicating in a way they consider appropriate.They continued: There is nothing intrinsically novel or distinct about the use of private email accounts, instant messaging and private devices.It was added: The claims advanced are detached from the reality of current working practices. The modern working age is defined by instant and fast-paced communications.This has only been enhanced by the pandemic, and the consequent legal requirements and the Government guidance, which necessitated the need for remote working, and in which context increased the need for fast communication across Government on urgent matters.Ministers and officials need to engage speedily and effectively with others.They went on to criticise the unreality of the claims made, saying they insulate the Government from the modern world.In their separate claim against Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the Good Law Project is expected to argue over the use of non-Government communication channels.As part of a dferent claim over millions of poundsapos worth of antibody test contracts, the GLP previously asked the High Court to order searches of former health secretary Matt Hancockaposs Government email accounts and his non-Government communications systems used for Government business - thought to include WhatsApps.The claims are due to be heard over three days before Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Johnson, with a decision expected at a later date.The hearing continues.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Sarah HarrisonDonald TrumpBoris JohnsonNadhim ZahawiWhatsAppConservative PartyAtc Inc.AppsCivil servantsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is expected to tell Brits how the Government will help them get through the looming cost of living crisis. He has hinted he may cut fuel duty by up to p per litre, with forecourt prices soaring since Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine.The Labour leader backed the move – and repeated calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to drive down soaring energy bills.He said: “Everybody is talking about how they’re feeling the pinch. They want to know that the Government is hearing them, that it’s going to do something about it”. He added: “I think the simple things are a windfall tax on oil and gas companies who’ve made more profit than they expected, use that to bring down bills.  “If the Government is going to actually do something about fuel duties, then, of course, we will support that because I think, for most people, this is such a dficult situation.” As households and businesses struggle, No  admitted that the Government’s energy security strategy had been delayed again to next week. Mr Starmer also said a planned National Insurance rise was the “wrong tax at the wrong time”.There is speculation Mr Sunak could scrap the rise for lower-paid workers by raising the threshold it starts to be paid at. The Resolution Foundation said boosting benefits would bring nearly four times more support to lower-earning families than scrapping the NI rise. It emerged last night pensions could rise by more than % in April  after the DWP insisted it “remains committed” to bringing back the triple lock – despite inflation rising.Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey will base the increase on average wages, .%, or September’s CPI inflation figure – whichever is highest.It will likely bring a bumper rise for pensioners next spring - but only after hefty real-terms cuts this year. The Resolution Foundation has said inflation could hit .% by September, higher than last year though still below a peak next month of .%. That would lead to a pensions rise of £ a week.  But the think-tank blasted the “rollercoaster ride” and urged ministers to ease pressure now Parents are also being squeezed by rising childcare costs and a drop in places, according to the charity Coram Family and Childcare. It found the UK-average price of  hours of care a week for an under two in nursery is £.. More than one in five people fear financial pressures will drive them into problem debt this year, debt charity StepChange found. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Ashworth claimed energy price rises will cause low earners and retirees to either “starve or freeze”. Below are six announcements expected on Wednesday: p fuel duty cut predictedFuel duty was frozen in October’s Budget for a th year in a row. But Tory MP Robert Halfon said it is “vital” it is now reduced as prices soar due to the Ukraine war. Mr Sunak has hinted it could be cut – amid speculation of p a litre. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour will not vote against a cut but warned that p may not “rise to the scale of the challenge”.Inflation set to peak at .% Inflation is set to peak at .% in April after the Russian invasion of Ukraine made it even worse. Officials fear it could go even higher, beating the .% rate of . Some warn it could hit %. This will blow out of the water October’s forecasts that inflation would peak at .% this year and could rise to .%. It will mean more expensive food and goods, hitting the poorest hardest. National insurance to rise to .% National Insurance will rise from % to .% from April and will be paid by anyone earning over £, a year, up from the £, a year it is paid at now. There’s speculation the Chancellor could raise this threshold, taking some of the lowest earners out of paying. One Tory said: “If it’s about pride, they can now say Ukraine is the reason they need to change course.”Benefits to go up by .% Benefits will go up just .%, as little as £. a month on Universal Credit. In October the Chancellor cut UC for millions by £ a week.Pensions will also rise by .%. In a Budget “rabbit out of the hat” in October, he handed more generous benefits to . million working families by cutting the UC taper rate from p to p.But this only helps those who work, not the sick or unemployed.MoD budget to be increased Westminster sources told the Sunday Mirror the Chancellor is planning to raise the £bn MoD budget. One said: “Ministers are no longer talking about cuts. They see the need to beef up our forces to confront Russia.” It may reverse the cut of , troops to , by . But the Chancellor played down reports, saying he has led the biggest post-Cold War defence spending rise.Plan to wean off oil but not gas expected The PM is expected to set out an energy supply plan to wean the UK off Russian oil – but not gas – by the end of the year. It is set to invest more in renewable and nuclear power and aim for more oil from places like Saudi Arabia. But Mr Sunak is said to have called for a delay to assess costs of nuclear and eco power. The PM is reportedly frustrated with his refusal to back nuclear power plans.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Department for Work and PensionsLabour PartyTaxEnergy billsPrice rises\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And then he wonapost. What heaposll do instead is slice a few pennies off fuel, and while you might think this is a dandy idea all it does is reduce the governmentaposs cut, and leaves the profits to oil companies who may, or may not, decide to lower the price you pay at the pumps.By cutting the cost of petrol and diesel, Rishi Sunak will take money out of the NHS, road repairs, schools, bin collections, social work, home help, and a thousand other things you donapost notice as much as the cost of a full tank, but need in order to survive, just the same.The fact heaposll do it while telling you heaposs making le easier for the average man on the street is a flat lie from someone who is at no risk of ever having to choose between filling up on fuel, or food. Itaposs classic Torynomics - the maths of keeping rich people rich, as opposed to making the poor better off.But what more could he do, the backbenchers cry. Vladimir Putinaposs put up the price of oil and gas, the pandemic has caused supply chain problems, and working from home has pinched the economies of our cities. Weaposve lost £bn of trade since Brexit, there are traumatised Ukrainians and Afghan translators to accommodate, weaposre full, weaposre broke, weaposre buggered. Plus, it isnapost easy, being green! There are some quite cheap and easy ways that he COULD put some money in your pocket, though. And heaposs not going to bother with any of them.. Insulate every home in the UK The quickest way of saving money on energy bills is to insulate your home. The rate of doing this has stalled, and while not everyone wants or can afford full net-zero compliance of the sort which Insulate Britain crackpots demand, it is possible for lots of us to do better -we had help. Cutting % VAT on insulation of any sort, plus the same for adding solar , wind turbines, or heat pumps, would make a big dference. Heaposs not going to, because itaposs not sexy, and why should you lot get something for less. . Windfall tax on the energy firmsShell is on track to post a £.bn profit this year, while BP is likely to make £.bn. Oil firms are taxed high already - %, compared to most companiesapos % - but letaposs face it, theyaposre at no risk of the workhouse. And it would produce a massive, immediate, undodgeable payday for government which could use it to bring down bills. He wonapost, for fear that it sets a precedent, which was the opposite of his reasoning when he said heaposd have to raise taxes because of the pandemic.. Raise the NI thresholdNext month everyone with a job, and every firm, will be paying more for the privilege. The .% hike Rishi will talk about is more accurately described as % - because NI contributions will be going up by about a tenth, from % to .%. Itaposs expected to raise £bn a year for the next  years, and will be given to the NHS to repair pandemic damage.But heaposs also asking the NHS to save £.bn in waste. If you think the NHS is currently wasteful, itaposs not clear how throwing another £.bn at it will help. If you think the NHS is underfunded, giving it billions with one hand and taking billions with the other also wonapost help. So whataposs happening is youaposre getting taxed % more for something thataposs not helpful, in any scenario. In any event, it should not be paid by the poorest. Raising the threshold at which you start paying from £, to the same as the income tax floor of £, would be fairer - and he wonapost do it because it effectively creates a tax-free basic income for everyone in work. It would mean less poverty, less disease, better nutrition, better health, and in the years to come lower costs for the NHS and social care, but why should the bleeding obvious matter a jot   . Make Brexit betterThe UK waved goodbye to £bn of cross-border trade with Boris Johnsonaposs bad Brexit deal this year, at just the time the effects were worse thanks to the pandemic and, now, the war crime spree in Ukraine. Thereaposs a simple way to restore every penny of it, though, which is to end all tarfs and customs checks by complying with EU standards on goods and services.It turns out, they werenapost so bad after all. And there is not a human in the world who wants to fill in  pages of customs declarationsthere is an option to not do so. This wonapost happen either, because it would involve a government built on hoods and ignorance admitting publicly that it doesnapost know the first damned thing about what itaposs doing, which would make Rishi look like the best economist while stood in a field of financial morons. Read more . Resign The worst Chancellors in British history are the ones who presided over growing poverty because they did not know what it felt like. They never went hungry, never shivered, never missed out because they could not afford to exploit an opportunity. The better ones did experience that, and knew the price paid for being poor - they knew that it led to sickness, squalor, worse workers, lower tax takes, public health problems and generational, national failure. They could see how hungry children led to lower GDP, and wanted to fix it.Little Rishi argued that feeding children was too expensive. He said helping the self-employed was too dficult, unless they were able to provide some PPE and had a Toryaposs phone number, in which case he happily threw billions at them, no questions asked. He didnapost have a problem giving visas to rich Russians, and now the government heaposs part of is rationing the welcome mat for poor Ukrainians. He seems to resent helping to keep factories open and Brits in work, sohe pulls POaposs freeport contracts on the basis itaposs fired a third of its UK workforce and employed Filipinos on £ an hour, realism itself will seek the therapistaposs couch.There are global, and dficult, economic problems to resolve. It requires someone with empathy, experience, and imagination to tackle them. Instead this chancellor will do tiny things - bijou cashbacks, petite lies, small-minded solutions that solve nothing. Thataposs why heaposs Little Rishi - thinks little, knows little, does little. The Spring Statement will be nothing more than Torynomics - bedtime stories from a man whose only real goal in le is to replace the party-mad pillock in Number , rather than nurse a nation back to economic health.Youaposll never get any financial sense from a man who spends £ on a coffee cup and £ on slippers.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON PO CompanyConservative PartyBPEuropean UnionNHSBoris JohnsonVladimir PutinTaxEnergy billsOil pricesWar crimesCrimePoliticsSolar powerRishi SunakThe BudgetSpring Statement\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Meanwhile tax and student loan repayment thresholds are being frozen in a ‘ stealth tax ’ squeeze on the cost of living.  The Mirror understands officials are braced for inflation to peak above % this Spring, with formal forecasts due to be produced tomorrow.Chancellor Rishi Sunak is considering cutting fuel duty by p a litre and is said to have looked at raising the National Insurance threshold, to take some of the lowest-paid Brits out of the soon-to-be-hiked tax.But heaposs resisting any bigger action like axing the NI hike entirely - or raising pensions or benefits beyond .%. Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis warned on Sunday: “I am virtually out of tools to help people now.  “It’s not something money management can fix. It’s not something for those in the lowest incomes, telling them to cut their bills will work. “We need political intervention.” So as we wait for Tory Rishi Sunak to deliver any help, let’s look at the biggest cost-of-living hikes he needs to deal with - and the dates they’ll hit. InflationDATE: NOWUK CPI inflation has already hit .%, raising the cost of food, energy and transport rises at the fastest for three decades.The war between oil giant Russia and wheat-producing Ukraine is now making this worse, with officials now braced for inflation to peak above % in April.It will mean the same pound in your pocket buys you less in bread or fuel, and tightens business margins to the point where firms could go bust. The Resolution Foundation expects inflation to remain high for most of this year and still be above % in September - a level not seen since the early s.  Interest ratesDATE: NOW Last week the Bank of England increased interest rates to .%, despite warnings it would “crush” households already drowning in the cost of living crisis.The Bank took the move to slow the economy down and cool soaring inflation . Governor Andrew Bailey recently appealed to workers not to ask for big pay rises, as that fuels inflation further. But it will mean new mortgage rates become more expensive, and inflicts an overnight rise to monthly payments for people on standard iable rates. Petrol pricesDATE: NOWPetrol prices have hit record highs due to Russia’s war in Ukraine, leading Chancellor Rishi Sunak to hint he’ll temporarily cut fuel duty.The average price of petrol reached .p a litre while diesel rose to .p a litre Sunday before last.A month earlier they averaged .p and .p a litre respectively. A family car with a typical -litre tank is now paying £.p to fill up compared to £. a year earlier.But Labour warned even a rumoured p-a-litre cut would make a dference of only a couple of quid to a family tank.And Mr Sunak would face pressure to make any cut permanent, despite Tories having frozen the duty for  years already while raising taxes on everything .Energy billsDATE: April The energy price cap will increase to a record £,-a-year for a typical household following soaring gas prices. Around million Brits on iable tarfs will be hit with a £ rise to the average annual bill overnight on April . Those on fixed tarfs will be hit by rises when their fixed-rate period ends. A second hike that could be just as big or even worse is expected on October . Rishi Sunak has announced plans to help, which include people living in bands A to D getting £ discount on their council tax in England, and a £ rebate off energy bills in October.But Labour has branded him the loan shark Chancellor as the rebate is effectively a loan which will need to be repaid over five years. Tory MPs say he must go further - for instance by increasing the £ discount or £ loan, or delaying repayments. But he was reluctant to announce help before April .  National Insurance riseDATE: April A £bn rise in National Insurance will hit working people as the Treasury looks to cut Covid backlogs in the NHS and begin funding social care.Employees will pay .p more in the pound on earnings above £, a year, a rise from % to .%. This earnings threshold has risen since last year, but only by .% - less than inflation. The Lib Dems brand this a stealth tax that makes Brits pay £ more.Those supportive of Boris Johnson argue the levy is progressive as the wealthier pay more.But Tory backbenchers hostile to new taxes baulk at the plans as the tax burden hits its highest in decades. While Rishi Sunak is unlikely to scrap the rise completely, there are claims he could change the earnings threshold - for instance, aligning it with income tax . Income tax ‘stealth tax’DATE: April Rishi Sunak chose to freeze income tax thresholds at a time when inflation is climbing at frightening speed. Youaposll have to carry on paying % on earnings over £,, and % on earnings over £, - just like this year. According to the Commons library, more than a million more people will be paying a higher rate of income tax by . And that was analysed before the latest rises in inflation. The IFS think tank now warns it’s a £.bn ‘stealth tax’, two and a half times bigger than first thought.  Real terms cuts to pay - including for NHS and teachersDATE: April Inflation means many planned rises to public sector wages - which are due every April - will be wiped out by rising prices. At this rate workers will need a rise of % to % just to keep up with rising prices, but the government is resisting these. Ministers have already spelt out plans to raise salaries for experienced teachers by only % in  . Health unions have also blasted plans to offer NHS staff in England a “miserly” % hike. The Royal College of Nursing is demanding % above inflation.  Council tax riseDATE: April  Most of England’s families will be hit with a Council Tax rise of % or more next Friday, Mirror research reveals. Of  councils that run social care, the Mirror found  were planning rises of .% - the maximum normally allowed this year. And a further  planned rises higher than .%, by using allowances that were unused in previous years. Now of course, most people’s council tax will be lower than last year due to the £ discount for Band A-D homes in England. But there are two big catches. First, that £ is meant to pay for energy bills - not absorbing the cost of a tax rise. In Rutland a Band D bill will go up by £, wiping out much of the £ discount. Second, the £ is a one-off. Next Spring, you’ll suddenly feel the force of not just this year’s rise but also the April  rise at the same time.Search for your council tax rise by postcode by following the link below. Covid testsDATE: April From April  the vast majority of people must paythey want a Covid lateral flow test - eventhey have a cough and fever. No has said spending £bn a month on free tests is not an effective use of taxpayers’ money at this point. This prompted a furious row with Labour, some medics and the Scottish and Welsh governments.Asymptomatic tests for NHS workers will be made available but not routinely, only as a surge effort where thereaposs an outbreak. But they will be available for care home residents. Exact lists of those eligible are being drawn up.Boots is preparing to charge £ for a pack of five. Student loans aposstealth taxaposDATE: April Millions will be forced to pay more on their student loans under what has been branded a “stealth tax rise”. Student loan repayment thresholds will be frozen from April  after plans to raise them by .% were scrapped. That means graduates will have to shell out more of their disposable income as wages and prices rise with inflation. The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies warned the freeze will cost £k earners £ a year more than they expected. IFS senior economist Ben Waltmann said it was “a further hit to real incomes”, adding it “effectively constitutes a tax rise by stealth on graduates with middling earnings.” It gets worse further in the future. Students starting university next year will begin paying off their loans when they earn more than £, - down from the existing £,-a-year threshold. And theof time to repay their debt will be extended to  years, up from . The IFS said this will leave poorer graduates paying £, more over their letimes.  Real terms cut to welfare benefitsDATE: April  Benefits will rise by .%, as little as £. a month on the rate of Universal Credit.Tory MPs pushed through the plans earlier this year - saying it was in line with inflation. But it’s only in line with what inflation was last September, before prices began to soar at an alarming rate. Many are warning that this will severely exacerbate the cost-of-living crisis for those who are struggling the most, with food bank use climbing. The Resolution Foundation has urged Rishi Sunak to raise benefits more generously as an urgent priority, ahead of any decision to cancel the National Insurance rise. Pensions are being cut in real terms - before rising next yearDATE: April Pensions could rise by more than % next April after the Tory DWP chief promised to bring back the triple lock - despite soaring inflation. Therese Coffey suspended the triple lock - a solemn manesto pledge - for one year in   because post-Covid wages were bouncing back in an “anomaly”.That sparked fury as it meant the state pension will rise by only .% next month, less than inflation. That is a real-terms cut of £ to Britain’s million pensioners, Shadow DWP chief Jon Ashworth said.But Ms Coffey said the triple lock wouldin   as promised. That could lead to a rise of .%, experts predict. A real-terms cut to childcare helpDATE: NOWPoor parents will be hit hard by April’s cost-of-living crisis as Tory ministers refuse to raise a crucial childcare allowance - despite soaring inflation. Parents on Universal Credit can claim back % of childcare costs, but only up to a £.-a-month cap - which has not changed since  and is not rising in April. Campaigner and working mum to a four-year-old and Gemma Widdowfield, , told MPs: “We’re all in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis. We’re all feeling the pinch. “My childcare’s going up slightly but the Universal Credit cap isn’t going up at all… that’s going to be passed on to us.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Spring StatementPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Energy bills, National Insurance and inflation are all surging in April, outstripping benefit, pension and wage rises. Inflation is already up .% in the  months to February - the fastest for  years. The Ukraine-Russia war will make inflation worse in OBR forecasts out this afternoon - the Mirror understands Whitehall officials are braced for it to go higher than %.Meanwhile tax and student loan repayment thresholds are being frozen in a squeeze on the cost of living. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has is considering cutting fuel duty by p a litre after dropping a heavy hint on Sunday - but Labour warn this would barely touch the sides. Heaposs also said to have looked at raising the National Insurance threshold, to take some of the lowest-paid Brits out of the soon-to-be-hiked tax. But heaposs resisting any bigger action like axing the NI hike entirely - as demanded by five anonymous Cabinet ministers. And he seems unlikely to raise pensions or benefits beyond .%, as called for by Labour and despite pensions being set to rise more than % in April .  A source told the Sun on Sunday: The Spring Statement will be very policy-light. Donapost expect him to pull a rabbit out of a hat. Maybe a few baby bunnies, no more. The SNP called for an emergency package of support while Labour demanded a windfall tax on oil giants. And TVaposs Martin Lewis said: “As the Money Saving Expert who’s been known for this - I am virtually out of tools to help people now. “It’s not something money management can fix. It’s not something for those in the lowest incomes, telling them to cut their bills will work. We need political intervention.” The Tory Chancellor said “where we can make a dference, of course we will” and has set up a cost of living unit in the Treasury - amid suggestions he could raise the £ council tax rebate or £ repayable discount off energy bills.  He also claimed he would be lowering taxes by  - after raising the tax burden to its highest in  years. Yet the only policy he had actually announced by Sunday is a demand for the NHS to make £.bn of “efficiency” savings to cut “waste” in a move reminiscent of austerity. Mr Sunak also warned Brits “it’s not going to be easy”, saying: “I wish government could solve absolutely every problem, that I could fully protect people against all the challenges that lie ahead. I can’t do that. So when and what is the Spring Statement, and what do we know about how it’s shaping up  Here’s what you need to know.What time is the Spring Statement  and how can I watch  Chancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver the  Spring Statement on Wednesday  March at .pm. He will give a speech in the Commons, followed by documents and forecasts published online. You can follow live coverage on this website with all the analysis of what it means for you. We will also be running a liveblog with a video feed of the Chancelloraposs statement, and it will run on major news channels and BBC Parliament. What is the Spring Statement The Spring Statement is a ‘mini-Budget’ by the Chancellor on the situation facing the economy.It is lower-key than a Budget and does not contain the same tax and spending powers.For instance, fuel duty and taxes on cigarettes and alcohol were already set for the year in October’s Budget. So was the minimum wage rise from £. to £. in April - though you can expect Mr Sunak to crow about it anyway.What will Chancellor Rishi Sunak announce during the Spring Statement The Chancellor is expected to lay out the sheer scale of the cost-of-living disaster hitting poor Brits. This will be in the form of Office for Budget Responsibilityforecasts on GDP growth, borrowing, debt and inflation. They will also have the warm-up acts of the Bank of England’s interest rates decision tomorrow, and monthly inflation figures for February - which will be published at am on the day of the Spring Statement. While growth is rising post-Covid, so is inflation - and it is set to be much worse than the last forecast . All this will ramp up pressure to announce extra help for households - but he’s reluctant to do that. He reportedly has £bn more in coffers than hoped as rising prices lead to higher taxes. But soaring inflation looks set to push up his borrowing bill, as debt costs more to pay back. He could recycle already-announced policies or announce vague ‘consultations’ on future ones, but will it be enough  UK inflation could rise over % Shock analysis last week found inflation is set to peak at .% in April after the Ukraine invasion made it even worse.The Mirror understands Whitehall officials believe this figure, calculated by the Resolution Foundation, is broadly accurate. Officials in fact fear it could go even higher, beating the .% rate of  and even hitting %. This will blow October’s forecasts - that inflation would peak at .% this year and could rise to .% - out of the water. It will mean more expensive food and goods in the shops, hitting the poorest families hardest. Will fuel duty be cut on petrol - but tolls on roads  Fuel duty was already frozen at October’s Budget for a th year in a row - handing £, to the average car driver since . But on Sunday the Chancellor dropped a heavy hint he could go further and cut it - after the war saw prices rocket. Mr Sunak said: Obviously I canapost comment on specic things. But what I would say, I understand that, I have a rural constituency, people are incredibly reliant on their cars and this is one of the biggest bills that people face, watching it go up, right, weaposre all seeing that, when weaposre filling up our cars. I get that. The Resolution Foundation declared fuel duty cuts will inevitably be part of the package announced this week. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour would not vote against a fuel duty cut - but warned Sky News: “Even a p reduction in fuel duty will only reduce filling up the car with petrol by £. So I donapost think that really rises to the scale of the challenge. Meanwhile, itaposs been claimed the Chancellor is looking at new ways of taxing drivers in the long term - including toll roads.  Will National Insurance thresholds change National Insurance will rise from % to .% from April . Tory MPs are still pushing for this to be cancelled as it’s a major tax rise just as a cost-of-living crisis hits. Downing Street insisted the rise is going ahead, despite reports that five Tory Cabinet ministers staged a last-minute plea to axe it. But could it be tweaked instead  Itaposll be paid by anyone earning over £, a year - up from the £, a year now. Thereaposs some speculation the Chancellor could raise this threshold, which is currently lower than the point at which people pay Income Tax. That would take some of the lowest earners out of paying the tax altogether. The failure to raise the threshold by inflation is a stealth tax thataposs costing Brits an extra £ a year, says research. One Tory told the Mirror: “If itaposs about pride, they can now say that Ukraine is the reason they need to change course. Pensions will be cut now - but hiked later Pensions could rise by more than % next April after the Tory DWP chief promised to bring back the triple lock - despite soaring inflation. Therese Coffey suspended the triple lock - a solemn manesto pledge - for one year in   because post-Covid wages were bouncing back in an “anomaly”. That sparked fury as it meant the state pension will rise by only .% next month, less than inflation. That is a real-terms cut of £ to Britain’s million pensioners, Shadow DWP chief Jon Ashworth said. But Ms Coffey said the triple lock wouldin   as promised. That could lead to a rise of .%, experts predict. NHS forced to cut £.bn of aposwasteapos The Chancellor announced a demand for the NHS to make £.bn of “efficiency” savings over three years to cut “waste” in a move reminiscent of austerity. That means DOUBLING the annual NHS efficiency target to .%. The current level of waste across government is simply not acceptable,” Mr Sunak said. But Pat Cullen, General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: “Trying to squeeze even more out of the same staff will not work. The existing shortages already mean nursing staff work unpaid overtime to keep the NHS running.” Another £ million is predicted to come from a review of Quangos or armaposs s bodies - publicly funded but not entirely Government-controlled. Could Rishi Sunak change energy grant  Previously Rishi Sunak announced a £ council tax discount for Bands A-D next month, and a £ repayable rebate in October. Yet bills are rising by £ a year on April  and will rise again in October - possibly by another £, a year. This is a far bigger hit to the poorest tenth of households who spend around % of their income on energy. The richest spend %. Thereaposs speculation Mr Sunak could increase the £ or £ packages to make them more generous.Treasury officials want to wait until the run-up to the October rise before announcing more help. But a former Treasury minister told the Mirror that approach is “not going to work”, adding: “He’s going to have to do something, it just can’t be the full Covid.” Will there be help for childcare  The Chancellor is considering more help for parents who pay for childcare after Boris Johnson raised the issue in Cabinet, according to the Sunday Times. Ministers are said to be looking at plans to increase the number of children that registered childminders can look after, which now stands at six up to the age of eight. Dad-of-six Jacob Rees-Mogg - who has a nanny - is said to have backed the idea saying: Even I can look after six children at once.Row over energy supply plan and nuclear power Boris Johnson was supposed to set out a delayed, long-term energy supply plan this week - for the UK to wean off Russian oilby the end of the year. This is expected to invest more in renewable power and nuclear power, as well as trying to get more oil from places like Saudi. But it has been repeatedly postponed and now wonapost be this week. Rishi Sunak reportedly insisted it should be delayed to give him more time to assess the costs of nuclear and green power. The PM is privately frustrated with his Chancelloraposs refusal to endorse a massive surge in nuclear power, according to the Sunday .  Will other tax hikes change  The Income Tax personal allowance and p rate threshold will freeze at £, and £,. The IFS think tank warns the threshold freezes will lead to more than £bn in ‘stealth’ taxes as inflation soars - and by , % of GDP will have been added to the UK tax burden. Meanwhile the VAT rate for hospitality firms, currently .% due to Covid, is due toto %. There are spaces here for the Chancellor to act - but it would scupper his claims to be recovering from Covid.Will benefits and pensions rise in April Mr Sunak will raise benefits by just .% - as little as £. a month on Universal Credit and far less than inflation. In October he cut Universal Credit for millions by £ a week. Pensions will also rise by just .% after the triple lock was axed.In a Budget rabbit out of the hat in October, he handed more generous benefits to .million working families by cutting the Universal Credit taper rate from p to p. But this only helps those who work, not the sick or out-of-work.The Resolution Foundation is worried there will be a “rollercoaster” with real benefits down this year and up next year. Tory MP Nigel Mills suggested bringing forward next yearaposs increase in Universal Credit to this autumn to solve the problem. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves called for benefits to rise by the rate of inflation - which is .% now and could rise beyond %. That could be double the .% rise in April, worth just £. a month on the standard allowance of Universal Credit. She told the Observer: “The chancellor should look at how to uprate benefits in a fair way. They are supposed to go up by inflation and they are not at the moment. But Mr Sunak seems unlikely to raise benefits by more than .% because of the multi-billion pound cost - and the need to raise pensions and pay at the same timehe does.  Will defence spending rise  Westminster sources told the Sunday Mirror the Chancellor is planning to raise the £billion MoD budget. One said: “Ministers are no longer talking about defence cuts. They now see the need to beef up our forces to confront Russia.” And that could reverse the planned reduction of , troops to , by . But the Chancellor tried to hose down the reports, saying he has already presided over the biggest rise in defence spending since the Cold War.Will there be a pay rise for nurses, teachers and other public sector workers from April  Inflation means planned rises to public sector wages - due every April - will be wiped out by prices. Rising prices put huge pressure on the Chancellor to give these vital key workers pay rises above % or %, to avoid hitting them with a real-terms cut. But the Treasury is resisting such big cash rises. The government has spelt out plans to raise salaries for experienced teachers by only % in  .Health unions have also blasted plans to offer NHS staff in England a “miserly” % hike.Pressure on the Chancellor to reverse this will be huge but again, it will take a lot for him to budge.  Will alcohol prices rise and when  The cost of beer and sparking wine will fall, but whisky and vodka prices will rise, according to changes already announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in his October Budget. Currently there is a complicated system of  separate tax bands for booze, across four main areas: beer, cider, spirits and wine. But the chancellor will do away with the old system and bring in a new one from February next year. This means tax cuts on drinks like normal-strength beer, wine, cider and liqueurs, but tax hikes on spirits like whisky. Sparkling wine costs will fall by around p a bottle.A vision beyond Covid and the war The Chancellor will likely try to set out a world beyond Covid but the Ukraine war and soaring inflation will make this dficult. Expect many references to infrastructure and ‘levelling-up’ but be on the lookout for old pots of money being reannounced. One Tory admitted to the Mirror: “The Rachel Reeves line that weaposre a high tax, low growth Government is true at the moment. “We donapost seem to have many pro-growth policies, weaposve pretty much given up on supply-side reforms.

As well as plunging into debt, they could also experience physical and mental health problems, according to research from GambleAware. Campaigners urged those affected to seek help from the National Gambling Treatment Service.

But GambleAware fears that for every person who gets NGTS support, nearly  others who could benefit do not get the help they need. Among gamblers who did access treatment, the most common reason for seeking help was mental health concerns, cited by %, followed by financial reasons, highlighted by %. GambleAware chief executive Zoë Osmond said: “While we’re proud to have enabled over , people over the past six years to get the help they need, we know there are many more out there who also need help. “Our message to anyone struggling or worried about their loved ones is that you are not alone.”  Labour MP Carolyn Harris, who chairs Parlaiment’s cross-party group on gambling-related harm, said: “These figures are yet a further demonstration of the immense harm that can be caused by gambling.“We urgently need the Government to come forward with reforms to properly regulate gambling. “As part of this, treatment for addiction must be funded by a statutory levy on the industry - it is only right that the industry pays for the harm it causes.” She called for treatment to be “operated wholly-independently of the gambling industry”.  The campaign is backed by comedian John Robins, who today opens up about his gambling problem. He said: “Gambling didnapost just cost me money, it also cost me friendships and my self-esteem. “It left me isolated and in total despair, and it almost cost me my le. “There are many people too afraid to seek help for gambling harms, but let me reassure you - it was the best thing I did.” The findings come from the annual GB Treatment  Support Survey of , adults carried out in November and December by YouGov.  A spokesman for trade body the Betting and Gaming Council said: “We do not recognise these figures which are not supported by the Gambling Commission’s most recent research which showed rates of problem gambling have been falling. “According to the regulator is it .% – down from .%  months ago that’s equivalent to a drop from , problem gamblers down to , – not .m suggested by GambleAware. “Some .m adults enjoy betting and gaming each month, whether that’s playing the lottery, enjoying a game of bingo or a day at the races, playing casino games or having a bet on football and other sports. “We strongly support the Gambling Review as a further opportunity to raise standards, but it is vitally important it strikes the right balance between protecting the vulnerable and not spoiling the enjoyment of the vast majority who enjoy a flutter safely.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON John RobinsGamblingMental healthPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Richard will begin his fundraising for Brain Tumour Research this Friday when he will tour four Lloyds Bank branches in Worcester, Kidderminster, Droitwich and Cleobury Mortimer. It is part of a campaign organised by his sister-in-law who works for the bank. He was diagnosed with a Stage  glioblastoma multormetumour on New Year’s Eve - the same day he turned  and celebrated his ninth wedding anniversary with we, Lucy, aged . His symptoms began in September, , when he began experiencing severe pain at the back of his head which would last for days and gradually became more debilitating. Richard, managing director of Weldmax UK in Stourport-on-Severn, said: “I woke up feeling like I had been ‘on the pop’- which I hadn’t. I could see red and green lights in the corner of my right eye and remember a friend telling me about something similar they experienced whilst they were having a stroke and I thought that was happening to me.” His symptoms worsened and after losing his peripheral vision he was forced to pull over his van and seek help from strangers, who called Lucy to come and pick him up. She took him to AE at Alexandra Hospital in Redditch where his cancer was diagnosed. A further three CT scans and two MRIs were carried out to assess the tumour and he was transferred to the neurological unit at University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire . Results revealed the tumour was the size of a satsuma and attached like a millipede to his optic nerve, deeming it inoperable due to risk of further damage. He underwent a six week course of radiotherapy which finishes this month. On March  he will undertake a day of fundraising as part of Wear A Hat Day with the aim of collecting £,, which represents the cost of a day of research at one of the charity’s Centre of Excellence.

Do they describe me as aposThat Asian girlapos  Is my colour or my race a thing to describe me or stereotype me  The couple have been married for  years and are looking for a house to expand their family. Purplebricks have said they are no longer selling the property and have refunded the vendor fee. Mum-of-three Mrs Devine had lived in the house with her children and husband before moving to Sutton Coldfield two years ago.Mrs Devine told the Daily Mail aposthereaposs a lot more to the story than you know, adding Iaposm not the slightest bit racist.Sales trainer Sareena said she was in disbelief when she read the message.  She said: I had to read the message  times before it sank in. At first, it was laughable and I laughed because I didnapost know how to feel. And afterwards, the sadness kicked in and I got upset. “At first, it was laughable and I laughed because I didn’t know how to feel. And afterwards the sadness kicked in and I got upset. “Now, I’m not as angry as I was because I’ve come to terms with it but it’s just the shock I can’t get over.  “Where we live currently there’s a minority of Asians and it’s made me look at everyone dferently. I’ve never felt like that before. “I’m now conscious about what I’m saying andsomeone is looking at me. The couple have two children and have had to sit down with their eldest son, six-year-old Jhye, to explain racism to him. Sareena added: “I’ve always taught my eldest that words are just words. But I found that I had to have that conversation about racism with him. “The whole experience has made me scared for him.” Sareena was keen on the property because it was close to her family home where she grew up. The couple did not respond to the seller but reported them to Purplebricks. A Purplebricks spokesperson told the : The sentiments expressed in this message are completely opposed to Purplebricksapos views and values. As soon as we saw this comment, we told the vendor that we wouldnapost sell their house and refunded their fee. The house is no longer on the market with Purplebricks.

The ceremony will take place in Belmarsh prison, just weeks before the third anniversary of the WikiLeaks founderaposs dramatic arrest when he was dragged out of the Ecuadorian embassy. The wedding is expected to be attended by four guests, two official witnesses and two security guards.Assange has been held in the high-security jail as he fights extradition to the United States, where he is wanted over an alleged conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defence information.That follows WikiLeaksapos publication of hundreds of thousands of leaked documents relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. The -year-old, who denies any wrongdoing, has been held at Belmarsh prison since  and before that was holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London for seven years. He has won support for his case from human rights organisations and journalist groups across the world.  While living at the embassy he fathered two children with Ms Moris, a lawyer more than a decade his junior, who he met in  when she started work on his legal team. Their relationship began in . The registrar-led ceremony will take place during visiting hours at the prison, where some of Britainaposs most notorious criminals have served sentences, including child murderer Ian Huntley. Ms Morisapos wedding dress and Assangeaposs kilt - a nod to his family ties to Scotland - have been created by British fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, who has previously campaigned against his extradition. His fiancée has spoken of her joy at being allowed to marry the WikiLeaks founder despite restrictions being placed on their wedding. The guests will have to leave immediately after the event.  Ms Moris said: Obviously we are very excited, even though the circumstances are very restrictive. All the guests and witnesses must leave as soon as the ceremony is over, even though that will be before normal visiting time ends. Julian is looking forward to the wedding because it is finally happening, many months after we first made the request. A Prison Service spokesperson said: All weddings in prisons must meet the requirements outlined in the Prison Service policy. The service said photography for weddings in prisons is facilitated by prison staff, in line with established national policy on photographing prisoners.  It added: The relevant policy makes clear the governor can block images being takenit is believed they will be shared publicly, which can compromise prison security. Accordingly, photos will be taken by prison staff. The cost of the ceremony will be picked up by the couple. Supporters have been asked to dress asthey were attending a wedding. Instead of sending gts, it was suggested they donate to the new official Crowdfunder campaign, sponsor a park bench or similar in their area, and put up posters calling for Assange to be freed. Assange was denied permission this month to appeal at the Supreme Court against a decision to extradite him to the United States. He could still challenge any decision from the government to approve his extradition.

He also complained about being confined to his cell for  hours a day and demanded a supply of creamer for his coffee.Brueckner, who is being held at the Oldenburg correctional facility near Bremen, penned the letter to the Ministry of Justice.Madeleine, three, vanished from her parents’ holiday apartment at the Ocean Club complex in Praia da Luz in  as her parents were having dinner at a nearby restaurant. It sparked a worldwide hunt for the child and Kate and Jerry McCann have refused to give up hope of finding their daughter. Her whereabouts remain unknown, despite her disappearance being the most heavily reported missing person case ever. In the rambling note, suspect Brueckner said he was too scared to leave his cell over fears he would be attacked by other prisoners. “In the beginning, the fellow prisoners held back because they knew who I was, but had too little information about it,” he wrote.But after a TV documentary was aired he claims that he suffered “insults and death threats”. “I am forcibly self-isolating, since there is a high probability of a physical attack by fellow inmates,” he moaned.German newspaper Der Spiegel said he compared his long days in his eight sq metre cell to “torture”. Brueckner, who denies any involvement in Madeleine’s disappearance, refused to work in the prison factory over fears he would be attacked. “Should any of the inmates, due to ignorance or for whatever reason, think that they want to seriously injure me physically or even kill me, the locksmith’s shop is the ideal place for this,” he wrote. “Tools are lying around everywhere and it is possible a sharp blade can be found in a few seconds. “The repellent behavior of the prisoners working there was so threatening for me that I asked for the termination of my employment.” Brueckner also complained about the poor state of the pens provided to inmates at the high-security jail. German cops believe Brueckner abducted and killed Madeleine, who vanished from her parents’ Algarve holiday apartment in May .

Paul spoke about how he had to wait around, just in his shorts, while his “stinky” clothes were washed. He didn’t bother reporting it to the Leeds City Council at the time, about  months ago. He didn’t think the council would help him and continued to work that day.Paul said: “It once burst all over me, all over my work clothes. It stunk. I had to get all my work clothes washed and that. I got a wash in here and then the council washed it [the area] up. I just had shorts and that on, I had to take my clothes off and I had shorts on underneath. “I didn’t complain, I just left it. As long as I washed my clothes and that, I wasn’t really bothered to be honest. I know they wouldn’t offer anything anyway.”  Paul now works slightly further up the row at another fishmonger – which is historically Tarbett’s rival – TE Bethell Best Quality Fish. His boss Suzanne Lemming,  and owner of TE Bethell, condemned the level of maintenance as a disgrace. She said the council officers ought to be “sacked”. Suzanne said: “Look at the market, it’s filthy. We’re working with a bag of p*** up there. That’s what we call it. “That’s to collect the rainwater and then they’ll come and empty it from the buckets in the back there. It just goes through the hose pipes and then they’ll come to empty it.  “The management is an absolute disgrace, everyone wants sacking. If you look on the roofs, there’s a whole load of tissue paper to catch the water and buckets. That’s to catch the rainwater. All the way across, that’s all tissue paper. It’s disgusting.”This comes after a series of complaints about the council have come to light. Well-known butcher-shop Malcolm Michaels Quality Butchers is leaving due to aposhigh rent and minimal footfallapos. Plus another butcher J.P. Johnstonaposs has condemned the council for serving him an eviction notice in the post after  years of trading there.Suzanne added her voice to these complaints, labelling the rent prices “horrendous” for what they get. Suzanne said: “The rent is horrendous, when I started in , my rent was £ a month and now we’re on about £,. There’s tons less footfall. Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday were our main days, on a quiet day our minimum take was £ in about , now it’s usually £you’re lucky.” Leeds City Council says they’re in “constant discussion” with traders over improvement works. The local authority says it aims to renovate units to a “modern day standard”, which is presently being carried out on all , block shops. These improvements will “put a stop to the water ingress issues we have in this area, removing the temporary measure we have had to put in place”.A spokesperson for the authority added the Covid- pandemic has caused work to stall, with “dficulties” arising from finding suitable contractors to carry out the work.The council spokesperson went on to say: “Over £m has been given over the course of the pandemic in rent concessions, over and above any government grants received by traders. Additionally, phase one of the market’s restoration for the  block shops will cost just over £m with phases two and three still to come. Additionally, during  , £, was spent on repairs and maintenance for the market.”The local authority said it’s discounted rents over most the pandemic period, with just over £million in concessions, and continue to offset service charges.

Initial polling conducted between September  and February  on , Brits found that of those who reported having had Covid, % had at least one lasting symptom  weeks later. New data on , more Brits who took part in Imperial College London’s REACT-LC study shows those questioned in May  saw prevalence drop to %. One theory is that getting outdoor social contact and exercise in the brighter weather improves the chances of recovering from lasting illness. Author Prof Helen Ward said: “Fatigue and tiredness was the most commonly reported symptoms. They may have symptoms that are affected by the seasons. “Eventhe [Long Covid] estimates are at the lower end of the spectrum, we conclude that a lot of people have long persisting symptoms.“This is a major, major challenge [for the NHS ]. It’s the next big global health challenge.” The findings, soon to be published in the journal Nature Communications, show women are % more likely to suffer with Long Covid despite being less likely than men to suffer with severe complications during the initial infection. Detailed analysis found that symptoms that lasted for at least  weeks tended to group together. Many patients suffer lingering respiratory symptoms such as tight chest and shortness of breath. A second group of Long Covid sufferers tended to have tiredness, muscle and joint aches as well as dficulty sleeping Initial polling had come at the height of the pandemic when many people were going through lockdowns and staying home more. Researchers cannot rule out part of the dference in the later polling being down to people forgetting that their symptoms had lasted that long. Prof Ward added: “Most of the infections reported were from before  so there may be some aspect of recall bias.” At least half of the UK population is thought to have had symptomatic Covid. The study is being funded by the Government through UK Research and Innovation. Researchers found that for most people who caught Covid then symptoms faded in the first month. Howeverany symptom remained for  weeks then it tended to be with the patient for at least six months. “That suggests there’s some chronic illness going on there,” Prof Ward said. “We know millions of people in the UK have had this infection. “The more extreme cases have been left with signicant disability, such as profound tiredness and brain fog, and they really can’tand hold down a job.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSImperial CollegeLong CovidCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily health briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The teen has been without full-time education since April last year and his mum said it’s taken a toll on his mental health. Leanne - who has had to take unpaid leave to look after Jack - said she was given little warning before the decision was made. The school and Medway Council didn’t initially offer any kind of alternative educational programme while he waited for a new permanent school place, she claims. Jack had been at Bradfields - which caters for pupils with complex needs - for two years, which included pandemic lockdowns.Are you having similar issues finding a special school for your child  Let us know at webnews@mirror But on ing to the classroom in early  he lost his grandfather to Covid within a matter of weeks and then his auntie died suddenly. Leanne told the Mirror: “There was a lot of extra anxiety he had to deal with, on top of his own problems. “It was causing him extra stress. He went back to school and he was having more dficulties.” In March last year, Bradfields called Leanne in for an emergency review, with the council present. Jack had managed to escape the main school grounds the previous day and it was decided he would have his school hours reduced to one morning a week. But by the following month Leanne was told “it’s not working” and he has been at home ever since, she said.  Jack is still officially enrolled at Bradfields while the council makes enquiries for an alternative placement. However, Leanne claims the school - beyond sending a work pack last July - has never even checked how he is or sent him any work. Due to also having a daughter at mainstream school, Leanne needs Jack to get a place within a reasonable distance from their home so she can drop them both off, as he struggles to cope on other transport. But Medway has even looked outside the immediate area, with still no luck. And not once has Leanne had any contact with any of the schools, and none have ever met Jack before making a decision. “We are at the end of our tether now,” said Leanne. “It’s all just a waiting game and when you’ve got a child with severe needs and high anxiety, you’re left to just get on with it, which is quite disgusting. “It is a strain on the whole family.”  Leanne has put in a formal complaint to the council as she believes Jack is “not getting the duty of care he deserves”. “I have got a list of all the schools and they’ve either got a ‘no’ or ‘no space’ against it or ‘unable to meet needs’.” She said the whole system seems to be broken, and she feels discriminated against because Jack has multiple diagnoses, which the school were well aware of when he enrolled. She said: “It does feel like they are cherry picking children, taking the easier cases. That’s how it comes across.” She said Jack was highly reliant on the rigid routine school brought and is missing interacting on a regular basis with friends. He struggled in larger classroom settings and his tutor would often have to teach him in more secluded areas, sometimes out in school corridors. Leanne has since spoken to Medway SENDIAS, a local organisation which helps families whose children need special education support.She said they advised her to put in a complaint and to push for alternative education. Jack is now due to get a home tutor, but Leanne said that was never offered initially. In response to her formal complaint, in an email sent late last month and seen by the Mirror, the council said a referral to a tuition agency to provide tuition at home had now been made. Leanne said: “They didn’t give that to me without me pushing for it. It’s always been me having to push for it. “It’s upsetting because you know there’s a lot of other people out there that are not quite as wise and they take it as gospel what they’re being told and I don’t think it’s acceptable. “I am one of the ones that moan but you’ve got to, at the end of that day, it’s your child’s rights,” she added. The complaint response email added: We are very sorry that we have not been able to identy a school place for Jack as yet and we are continuing to work hard to resolve this. We understand your frustrations. There is a currently a lack of places within specialist educational provision nationally as well as in Kent and Medway generally. A statement from Medway Council said: “We are doing everything we can to help find a suitable school place, which is able to meet his complex needs. We have contacted a number of schools but unfortunately they either do not have any vacancies or are unable to meet his inidual needs. Whilst we continue to consult with suitable schools to find him a place we have arranged for a specialist tutor to help him. We are committed to ensuring every child in Medway receives the best education possible.” The Mirror has also contacted Bradfields for comment.

Workers on the site, on a plot of land neighbouring a number of bungalows on a housing estate in the Haughton Green area, were also captured leaning over a huge hole estimated to be around seven-feet deep.  Locals said they understood it was to become a swimming pool. The botched excavation work has now left one property on Gilbraltar Lane, close to the Haughton Dale Nature Reserve in the Tame Valley, aposunstableapos, said the Health and Safety Executive. Mr Matib was successfully prosecuted by HSE and was handed a suspended prison term at Manchester Magistrates Court.Those living nearby spoke of their anger and frustration at what had been happening at the site following the granting of planning permission several years ago. One man, Ernie Lamb, said it had been aposa nightmareapos. The -year-old said: Weaposve been here for two and a half years and itaposs been going on since before then. Itaposs been going on for up to four to five years I believe. Itaposs just gone on and on and on, and itaposs caused a lot upset round here.  I saw them working barefoot, everyone did! They were blaring loud music as well and we just couldnapost believe what we were seeing really. We kept asking how are they getting around that ground, because, as you can see itaposs rough down there. The whole idea was that it had a swimming pool and they dug it out and breeze blocked it. But it rained pretty solidly and it just filled with water. It must have been six or seven-foot deep. It also just had a really flimsy sort of wire mesh fence initially and this area is chocka with kids and people with dogs going down to the river in the valley and they were worried kids might get in and start playing in there. So I believe someone complained about that. Three dferent times, three dferent people came in with JCBs to dig and started digging. And the drivers were saying to us aposI donapost think he has any idea what heaposs doing, heaposs just telling us aposdig this, dig that.apos I donapost think a suspended sentence and a fine will mean much to him really.  John Hulme, , agreed. He said the work had been aposgoing on for yearsapos. Itaposs just been an eyesore and a consistent mess. They dug a massive hole which we think was meant to be the swimming pool and it just flooded. The last time I saw people working on there was probably when they had a cabin put in last April. When we did see people working on there they had no shoes, no boots, no protective equipment. It just saddened me really as they were just young lads and they werenapost being properly protected. It was an accident waiting to happen really. And I just donapost understand it or see the point. I canapost imagine how much they have spent on it. So either build it, and do it properly, or sell it. Thataposs how we see it.  You do obviously worry when such sub-standard work is being done on your doorstep. We werenapost too worried about our home but at other parts around it, fences have basically collapsed. AndI was the person who lived next door Iaposd be very worried about my foundations. Itaposs just been really frustrating for everyone. And who knows when it will get sorted as itaposs still an eyesore. On the sentence, he said: I donapost like to see people going to prison. The prisons are full as it is, and him going to jail wouldnapost solve anything so I think unpaid work probably is the most appropriate punishment.

Johnaposs we Sue, also  said: Heaposs a brick short of a loadhe doesnapost know how what people round there think of how heaposs behaved over it. I donapost think the sentence is strong enough. Shirley Hoyland, , said: Weaposve not been as affected as others as we have only been here under two years and we donapost directly overlook it. But you see lots of people coming and going, and they blatantly didnapost have the right gear or kit. It was shocking and pretty worrying, yeah. The HSE said they carried out an inspection in August  after neighbours raised apossignicant concernsapos over the work. A subsequent investigation found Matib had employed several groundworkers to excavate land ahead of the building of the new house.  However, he had failed to prepare risk assessments and method statements detailing how the work would be safely carried out, failed to appoint a site manager with suitable skills, knowledge and experience and failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the workers they said. A large, deep and unprotected excavation was found, meaning there was a foreseeable fall risk. In addition, excavations were not shored or suitably battered back to prevent the risk of collapse they added. Ultimately the work put workers in danger and rendered the neighbouring property unstable, the HSE said. Matib, of Allerton Road, Bradford, pleaded guilty to two charges under the Health  Safety at Work Act. He was sentenced to sixteen weeks imprisonment suspended for twelve months, ordered to carry out  hours unpaid work and pay costs of £,. Speaking after the hearing, Inspector Phil Redman said: Inspectors will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action against duty holders who fall below the required standards and put lives at risk.

The Queen welcomed the Ambassador of Qatar and the Ambassador of Poland via video link today. The diplomats, who were at Buckingham Palace, presented the letters of recall of their predecessors and their own credentials at the audiences on Tuesday.Speaking on GB News yesterday morning, the actor, who has long been friends with many members of the Royal Family, said: “I have heard that the reason she’s not doing a lot of the events that she should be doing and cancelling them is because she is in a wheelchair. “She doesn’t want to be seen, she’s very proud. She’s our greatest ever monarch. It’s so very sad and I hope she is able to make her anniversary celebrations.” His comments were made while speaking with Eamonn Holmes and Isabel Webster. Asked by Eamonn about comparisons with the Queen’s late sister Margaret, whose appearance in a wheelchair at the Queen Motheraposs st birthday shocked the public, he claimed it was “embarrassing” for her.  Royal aides are reportedly anxious for the Queen not to replicate her sister Princess Margaret who was seen in public in a wheelchair, six months before passed away.A palace source said: Itaposs a haunting image and not one the Queen remembers fondly, William Tallon, the Queen Motheraposs page, then pushed Margaret in front of the waiting media in a wheelchair. Margaret was known for glamorous good looks that had lasted well into middle age. The world had never seen her like this. A source who remembers the occasion told the Daily Mail: The optics were terrible. It was supposed to be about the Queen Mother but all anyone saw was a sadly declining Princess Margaret. Last week, the head of state missed the Commonwealth Day service at the Abbey, a decision understood to be related to her comfort rather than a specic illness. But she has continued with light duties including some face-to-face audiences. Today, the Queen was onscreen and seen smiling and wearing a regal purple day dress. She welcomed the Ambassador of Qatar Fahad bin Mohammed Al-Attiyah, who was joined by Sheikha Raya Khala Abdulla Khala Al Khala. The monarch also received Polish diplomat Professor Piotr Wilczek. In just a weekaposs time, the Queen is hoping to attend the Duke of Edinburghaposs memorial service at Westminster Abbey. Large numbers of the royal family are set to gather next Tuesday, alongside Philipaposs friends, colleagues, representatives of organisations he supported and foreign royals to pay tribute to the -year-old duke who died in April last year.

An error on Camelotaposs app meant around , people were told their winning tickets had actually lost after scanning their QR codes.

Another mistake saw , players buy single tickets - but they were charged for and received two tickets. Everyone either received a refund for the ticket they didnapost want or paid for their wins.  A final blunder saw marketing messages sent out to customers that had self-excluded on Gamstop, which is a free service enabling users to limit their online gambling, as well as players who had been identied by Camelot as having a gambling addiction. This message was sent although none of the , players could buy a National Lottery ticket through the app. Andrew Rhodes, Gambling Commission Chief Executive, said: We are reassured that Camelot has taken steps to make sure that their National Lottery app is fit for purpose.

Joan Blass died in March , sparking the beginning of a nightmare for her family. Her son and daughter became worried when a man  years younger became friends with her and moved in with her five months before her death. Daughter Daphne Franks, of Skipton, North Yorkshire was concerned because her mum was not aware he lived in her home and did not no know his name or where he was from.She told LeedsLive : Mum never seemed to know he lived there.She was asking, aposwhat is his name  Where did he come from apos At this stage, Joan could barely recall her own name, let alone that of her new toyboy.  When she died, the family discovered that Mr Folan had married her and the dementia sufferer was still wearing the wedding ring from her late husband Ron. Ron died in  after  years of the couple being together. Her new marriage meant her two children Daphne,  ,and Michael, , lost out on their £, inheritance because the registry office ceremony annulled her will. Daphne discovered three days after her motheraposs death that she had been married in a civil ceremony at Leeds Town Hall. Speaking to Predatory Marriage UK, Daphne said: We had contacted my motheraposs GP on so many occasions, the police, the social services, and had also taken legal advice and had been told that she could not make another will or marry again because of her severe dementia. Taking the toyboy to court The marriage meant the will Mrs Blass had drawn up, naming her two children as beneficiaries, was void and she died intestate, meaning her new husband automatically inherited her assets. Daphne decided to take legal action after Folan, now , took over the funeral arrangements. The hearing lasted four days but sadly for the family, siding with Mr Folan. Mrs Franks and her relatives were left with a £, legal bill. On top of that, none of Joanaposs relatives were invited to her funeral and she was buried in an unmarked grave.  Pushing for change Since the nightmare the family have been pushing for action to stop predatory marriages. Predatory Marriage UK aims to reform marriage laws and procedures to protect people with dementia. In  Fabian Hamilton, MP for Leeds North East, called on the PM to stop elderly and vulnerable people being preyed upon by tricksters leading to families losing their inheritance. Mr Hamilton first began campaigning on the matter a few years ago after hearing a story he could “hardly believe was possible in modern Britain”. He said: “It’s not good enough for a registrar simply to say that because one of the participants in the marriage ceremony was smiling at the time, that meant consent was happily given. The family have been working with Hourglass charity to welcome round-the-clock help. Mrs Franks said a   helpline would make an absolute dference. The Frank family have recently been working with Hourglass charity to get round-the-clock help for those affected by elder abuse. Ms Franks said a   helpline would make an absolute dference. She added thatshe had known about a helpline before she would have definitely rung it. The Hourglass charity said it was moving Its helpline to a   operation because more than a quarter of the calls it received went unanswered during out of hours. It said Home Office funding meant it was now able to extend its service to make sure calls were being answered day and night. Richard Robinson, Hourglass CEO, said: Thankfully we are increasingly aware of other forms of abuse like child abuse and domestic violence, but the abuse of older people remains in the shadows even though it affects millions. So many people are suffering and donapost know where to turn for help.

Despite the encouraging drop off in positive cases in just seven days, itaposs still over double what it was this time last month - just two days before Covid measures were scrapped in England.

The figures then rocketed again a week later by %. Downing Street was warned it was taking a major risk in introducing its Living with Covid plan last month.  It means those who test positive are no longer required to self-isolate, but are advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five days. Masks are also no longer legally required in public. As of April , lateral flow tests will no longer be free, except for over-s and over-s with weakened immune systems.  This time last year on Tuesday, February ,  the UK recorded just , new cases. However, England was just emerging from its latest lockdown - with the Prime Minister unveiling his roadmap for lockdown easing the day before on February . At that time in , schools in England had reopened, recreation in outdoor public spaces was allowed between two people - but the stay at home order remained in effect.  Following a Christmas  easing of rules, despite the highly transmissible B iant - first identied in Kent - running rampant, the Government had been forced to throw the country back into full lockdown for months. In terms of deaths, the UK recorded  last Tuesday and  the same day the previous week. On Tuesday, March , the figure was  and  two days before the new plan was brought in.  This time last year, on Tuesday, February , , a total of  deaths were recorded - a dference of % on todayaposs toll. And considering the UK had been in lockdown since the start of the previous month, it shows how far the country has come in breaking the link between infection and death. This is in no small part thanks to the rollout of the vaccine programme.  As of the latest figures released on Monday, a total of ,, people have had their first jab in the UK. Those having had both total ,, and boosters ,,.The UK is currently contending with yet another new iant the BA. strain of Omicron, which is said to be more transmissible than its predecessor. Hybrid versions of the coronavirus that combine genes from the Delta and Omicron iants - dubbed “Deltacron” - have been identied in patients across Europe and the United States, researchers have said.It has been officially confirmed as a new iant. According to analysis of Deltacron’s genetic code, its “backbone” is derived from the Delta iant while its spike – the part of the virus that attaches itself to human cells – is from Omicron.  In fact, Professor Adrian Esterman, an epidemiologist and biostatistican, said the iant could be one of the most infectious diseases the world has ever seen.He said it is up to six times more transmissible than the original strain of Covid - hence the up surge in new cases. BA.aposs R number, the rate at which it can spread, was at  last week, compared to . for the original virus. But it appears to be far less deadly than previous strains.

Bare-knuckle boxer Big Willy Collins, dubbed the King of Sheffieldby the travelling community he came from, was aged just  when he died during a family holiday to Majorca in July . The huge grave stone - which is said to be made of  tonnes of fine Italian marble - has been branded an eyesore and monstrosity by some visitors to the cemetery in Sheffield whoaposve taken issue with its extravagance, Yorkshire Live reports.Council bosses revealed that the headstone had been erected without permission, meaning it may have to be demolished in the future. And now Sheffield City Council has announced they are considering the next steps to address the memorial. The local authority rules that memorials must be under three inches thick and no taller than .ft. Applicants also need to noty the council about materials and proposed inscriptions before permission is granted.  Councillor Alison Teal, executive member for sustainable neighbourhoods, wellbeing, parks and leisure, said: We are aware of a large memorial which has been erected in Shiregreen Cemetery. This memorial was built without permission and we are currently considering our next steps. Cemeteries are a place where people can come, pay their respects and visit loved ones who are no longer with us. We understand memorials are deeply personal, however we must have rules in place to ensure fairness. The stone - which is emblazoned with the word King in large gold letters - has been shared on TikTok since his family unveiled it last Thursday.  But some visitors have no problem with the gravestone at all.Mandy Stratford, who was visiting a loved oneaposs grave at the cemetery, told the BBC : I think itaposs beautul. It doesnapost offend me at all and I think itaposd be a shamethey did take it down.I donapost think itaposs offending anybody in the position itaposs in. If it was in the middle near everyoneaposs loved ones I could understand it. The stone features imposing biblical carvings, a working jukebox playing Willyaposs favourite tunes, and -hour surveillance which acts as a walkie-talkie for his family to converse with him whenever they need. However, many other visitors have branded the stone an eyesore and a monstrosity.  Kelly Greaves said: My husbandaposs cousin has had no end of problems with red tape for her -year-old sonaposs grave. Can’t put this on or that. Yet it’s nothing like this. I’m not saying this is wrong! I’m sayingthis is right then it should be right for everyone and should be equal. Lesley Smith said: How was that monstrosity allowed  Countless times, bereaved parents of young children have had to move teddy bears etc from graves in other cemeteries. Lights and a jukebox in a cemetery whatever next.Willyaposs family spared no expense for his send-off, which featured a procession of Rolls Royce cars and a horse and carriage. The funeral was a massive affair, with hundreds of well-wishers lining the streets to pay their respects, to a man that was very well known in the Darnall area of Sheffield. Meanwhile, Tara Dawn Ellen said that the structure looks hideous and Gill Camidge agreed, commenting: OBSCENE should not be allowed. Let them build their monstrosity on their own land!! And Lorraine Larkings said: How or why are allowed such a big area  If you go over your grave area you soon get a letter to remove it. Peter Bradford said that it is embarrassing that this has been allowed to happen, while Carol Bodham said: What a monstrosity absolutely hideous. And Leslie Wand said that she has been tending to her own daughteraposs grave in Shiregreen Cemetery and has had to put up with the loud music. Simone Fenton-Jarvis said: Sheffield City Council Can you explain how this was allowed  Music in a cemetery  What happened to rest in peace  I also thought there was a lack of space leading to increased cremations !

Lucky sunbathers on the beach basked in C heat and it will be a similar story on Wednesday while in comparison in Marbella, on the Costa del Sol, it is set to be rainy day with highs of just C. The warm weather is the result of a high pressure system that has moved in from the east and is now settled on the country for the next few days.There is plenty of sunshine ahead and going into the weekend but then there is likely to be an abrupt halt with BBC weather predicting ato “wintry weather”. Maps from WXCharts show temperatures nose-ing next week and could even get as low as -C in Scotland on Friday, April . Snow could also fall across Scotland and northern England on the first weekend of April. But for this week there are glorious temperatures albeit with cold starts to the day. BBC weather forecaster Ben Rich said: “High pressure still close by on Wednesday, it stays mostly dry and with those clear skies overhead quite a chilly start to the day with temperatures down to around freezing and below freezing in a few places. One or two early fog patches around too, they should tend to lt and clear by the early part of the morning and then it is another beautul spring day with y spells of sunshine and the vast majority will stay dry. There is just a small chance of one or two showers popping up in north east Scotland and maybe in the eastern counties of England. Not as breezy as it was on Tuesday across western areas but every bit as warm with top temperatures C to C or even C.” Temperatures are then expected to drop again on Wednesday night to around freezing and fog patches for Thursday. It is not expected to be quite as hot for Thursday and Friday but top temperatures will still be C and then it is also expected to be fine for the weekend. Mr Rich said: High pressure continues to hold firm so despite that extra cloud and the chance of a bit of fog it is going to stay fine and dry with some spells of sunshine. Into next week though we will develop a northerly wind, it will start to feel quite a lot colder and there could even be some wintry showers. UK forecast for the next  days Mostly dry and sunny. Feeling warm. Today: A chilly start but after any early morning fog clears it will be dry for the vast majority with long sunny spells and becoming warm again. Perhaps an isolated shower developing in the east and north later in the afternoon. Tonight: Dry with clear spells, although becoming cloudier in the northwest later. Cold under the clear skies with rural grass frost, and a few fog patches, more especially in eastern England. Thursday: Again mostly dry and warm with sunny spells for many although cloudier than of late in the northwest. A few well scattered showers possible, most likely northeastern England and Scotland. Outlook for Friday to Sunday: Mostly settled with warm sunny spells each day, but cooler near coasts and overnight. Far north cloudier with light rain at times. Some fog patches for north and east coasts.

The fugitive pulled off his escape act when officers turned up at the tower block in Preston, Lancashire, to arrest him. The video shows the track suited escape artist climb out of a four-storey window before using ropes to shimmy down towards Samuel Street on the Callon estate. He appears to use dog leads or belts tied together to lower himself halfway down before leaping from the second floor.  He hits the ground hard, landing next to one of the police cars, before hurling himself over a metal fence and fleeing on. Lancashire Police have named the suspect as Jamie Carlisle and say he is wanted in connection with threats to damage property in the city. The hunt is under way for the nimble-limbed -year-old and police have appealed for anyone with information to get in touch.  A police spokesman said: “Officers attended an address off Samuel Street, Preston, yesterdayas part of our enquiries to trace wanted man Jamie Carlisle. Carlisle is wanted in connection with making threats to damage property following reports of a public order earlier this month. “We are aware of a video circulating on social media showing a man climbing down from a fourth story window and jumping to the ground in order to evade police.  “We are continuing to actively search for Carlisle and we would urge anyone with information to contact us.

The plane had to be erted after she became aposdisruptiveapos and reportedly slapped other passengers. One female passenger on board has told The Mirror how her young daughter was left traumatised by the womanaposs foul behaviour and fighting. The Jet flight to Antalya left Manchester at around .am on Monday and was due to arrive in Turkey around four and a half hours later.It was erted to Vienna and landed there around .am, reports the Manchester Evening News . In the video, the irate passenger is seen screaming in the face of a unormed staff member at the front of the plane.  As other flight staff gather around her to aid their colleague, it looks as though she lashes out with her hands against someone seated in the first row. A member of staff can be seen telling her to aposstand backapos, to which she replies: I am back. Sort your head out you. The airline worker says: You are not doing yourself any favours. She replies: Yourapose not doing yourself any favours either. So what have I done  Donapost touch me, donapost ****ing touch me. She adds: What have I done  What have I done wrong on this flight, eh  See, you havenapost got an answer.  Another passenger, who asked only to be named by her first name, Emma, told The Mirror it was about  minutes into the flight when the disruption started. She said: The flight attendant was trying to calm her down. She was being really loud and arguing with the passenger in front of her. That went on for about  minutes. They gave her notice that any more trouble and further action would be taken and were telling her aposweaposre not here to be horrible to anybodyapos. She was not having any of it. She was aggressive and swearing, it was not a nice experience. You didnapost dare look at her. At one point I walked down the aisle to go to the toilet with my little girl and she said aposwhat the f*** are you looking at  Go on, have a f***ing look all of you.apos  Emma said the ‘disruptive’ passenger was “ranting and raving”. She said people made her her aware there were children on board when she was “shouting and swearing” but she “retaliated” and swore more.“She lunged forward and slapped a woman around the face,” Emma added.“A guy got up and calmed her down, who I think had just qualied as a police officer. “It was announced on the tannoy we were making an emergency landing. We landed in Vienna and stayed for about  minutes. “The flight was a nightmare from start to finish. “I was frightened. My daughter was panicking.“Nobody wanted to intervene because they didn’t want to get in trouble”. A witness on the flight said: This was a truly horrible flight for myself and my  children. My little girl was traumatised at the ladyaposs foul behaviour fighting and shouting and swearing. Sheaposs now refusing to fly home due to this it scared her so much. A man can be seen shaking his head at the womanaposs behaviour. Another video clip appears to show the moment armed police officers escorted the woman from the plane. One passenger can be heard to shout: Wait til you get the bill love. Others are shouting bye bye as the woman is led away by armed officers.  A text sent by Jet to passengers onboard the flight shortly before pm said: Hello, we are sorry that due to the disruptive behaviour of a fellow passenger, your flight has been erted to Vienna. We are working on a situation to get you on your way as soon as possible. The flight arrived at its original destination, Antalya, just after pm - one hour and  minutes later than scheduled. A Jet spokesperson said: “We can confirm that flight LS from Manchester to Antalya erted to Vienna yesterday so that a disruptive passenger could be offloaded. As a family friendly airline, we take a zero tolerance approach to disruptive behaviour.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON JetCrimePlanes\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Butyou donapost mind the eight-legged creatures, letting them roam free on your walls and ceilings might seem like a great idea, especiallytheyaposre going to snack on insects like mosquitos that would otherwise be leaving bites all over your body.Thataposs the thought process of one woman from Australia, who has been allowing a massive huntsman spider to live on the ceiling of her living room for around two weeks - and has even named him Simon. Posting anonymously on Reddit, the -year-old woman admitted Simon can sometimes freak out her house guests, and revealed she recently had trouble when she invited her friend and his arachnophobic girlfriend over to stay for a few days.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.In her post, she said: I live in Sydney, where huntsman spiders are our common house spider. I’ve had onein my living room in the ceiling corner for about  weeks now. He’s hard to reach for me to trap and put outside, and honestly, he doesn’t bother me. He can chill there for as long as he wants so long as he keeps eating smaller bugs and so long as I can see him.A couple of weeks ago I had a friend named Ben and his girlfriend Shay stay over for a couple of nights. He lives in Melbourne, she’s from Wales and has only moved here recently. They’re travelling around Australia and Ben askedthey could stay at my place in Sydney as a favour. I was happy to do so! But I did warn him that there was a huntsman in my living room since I know foreigners can freak out about them. The woman insisted she warned the couple about Simonaposs presence, but her friendaposs girlfriend was still terried by the spider and demanded it be killed.  She claimed Shay called her f***ed up for keeping a spider in the house, but said she told her friendaposs girlfriend that she was doing them a favour by letting them stay here - so Simon wouldnapost be getting the chop because of them. She added: Shay and Ben got here and we were all having dinner and watching TV when Shay notices Simon chilling in the corner. She freaks out and says I need to kill it. I said no, I’m not comfortable killing spiders and he’s not hurting you. Apparently Ben hadn’t specied how big huntsman spiders are and Shay didn’t know. Shay kept telling us we needed to kill it. I said I didn’t want to, huntsman spiders are harmless and timid and they actually eat mosquitoes and other bugs you would rather not have in here. I askedshe had a phobia of spiders, she said spiders are fine but having one inside the house is f***ed up. I got kind of mad at that because I’m doing her a favour letting her stay for free, cooking for her etc and she’s calling me f***ed up for not killing a harmless creature.  I said, aposI doubt he’s the only spider, he’s just the only one you can seeapos. This p***ed her off even more, which I obviously understand so I get I may be the asshole for that. As a compromise, the woman and her friend ended up capturing Simon in a container and setting him free outside - but Shay was still traumatised by the events and demanded she and Ben stay in a hotel instead. The woman said: In the end, Ben and I ended up getting a step ladder, trapping him and putting him outside. She was not happy with this either and said that I should have killed it after putting it outside. She basically called me an a**hole and gave me dirties the rest of the night. They ended up leaving a day early to stay in a aposclean hotelapos . This again rubbed me the wrong way because my house is clean, it just had a spider in it ! Commenters on the Reddit post were mostly on the womanaposs side, as although they acknowledged Shayaposs fear and discomfort, they also said her comments were unnecessary. One person said: I mean, I understand why they freak people out. I wouldnapost kill one but I wouldnapost want one lurking either. While another wrote: I understand her fear but her comments were so unnecessary. How would you even kill a huntsman  Theyaposre like the size of dinner plates. While I would NOPE out of that house very quickly, she was told about the spider. She could have gotten it herselfshe wanted. She also continued to be an asshole after you had done what she wanted.

The man explained in his post that his mum had wanted to be in the delivery room but had reluctantly agreed to stay away when his we said she wasnapost comfortable having her there.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. His mum was then supposed to meet the baby at home, but after complications with the birth, the manaposs we was clearly exhausted so asked that her mother-in-law wait a few weeks before coming over. He wrote: My we recently gave birth to a beautul baby boy. He is the first kid in many years in my family and everyone was really excited about his birth, especially my mother. She wanted to be there in the delivery room with us but my we said no so I respected her wishes. I said she can meet him when we get home and my we agreed. Well, there were some complications in the birth and my we was clearly exhausted. In her exhaustion, she told me that maybe my mother waiting at the house isnapost a good idea, and said can I ask her to come after a couple of weeks. I was shocked and hurt. My mother loves my we and here my we was trying to intentionally hurt my mother. But seeing her in pain I couldnapost say no and called my mother. She was very upset.  A week after the birth of their son, the man asked againhis mum could visit and his we simply told him to wait. But instead of listening to the mother of his child, the man decided to go behind her back and invite his mum over anyway - specically when his we had left the house for a doctoraposs appointment. He added: A week goes by without any events. I asked my we again and again when can my mom come but she told me to wait. Yesterday my we went to a doctoraposs appointment and I was in charge of taking care of my son. Suddenly I got an idea and called my mother who lives nearby.  She came and met my son. The happiness that I saw on her face was amazing. It was an emotional moment for me when she held him for the first time. When the new mum came home and saw her mother-in-law she was furious, and exploded at her husband once his mother had left. He explained: She was just getting ready to leave but then my we arrived. She got very angry very fast. She didnapost say anything to my mother but I could see in her face that there was some rant coming. My mother left and my we exploded. I have never seen her this angry. She told meshe didnapost even invite her own mother then I shouldaposve understood that there was a reason. She was especially upset about me doing this behind her back. I said I am sorry multiple times but she is still angry. I slept in the guest room yesterday. I donapost think I did anything a good son wouldnapost do, but I do feel bad about hurting my we. Comments on the Reddit post were firmly on the new mumaposs side, as many of them pointed out that he should have listened to his we and respected her need to heal following the birth of their son.

The anonymous man said he was scrolling on his phone late one night when his Ring doorbell alerted him that someone was at the door. The alert scared the ever-loving s**t out of me, he said, but when the app showed a random hooded and masked person at his front door, he was understandably spooked.When theyaposd left, he went to see what all the fuss was about, and saw that the mysterious postman had delivered a letter, reports Daily Star.Butthataposs not weird enough, the bizarre letter was an accusation of an affair against a local restaurant owner, he claims.The confused homeowner posted a picture of the letter on Reddit and captioned it: Got an alert on my Ring doorbell at half eleven last night.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. “Somebody posting this through the door… The letter read: Hello my fellow [redacted]. My name is [redacted]. I am a victim of abuse and have been ill-treated and cheated on by an unsavoury character. His name is [redacted]. He is the owner of the [redacted] restaurant in [redacted]. A British Pakistani national, he is a married man with children. He has cheated on his loyal we on numerous occasions and has not kept his promises to me during our long secret relationship for one year and a half.All of promises he could not keep. My advice is to vulnerable women out there to be aware of this man and to avoid his manipulative ways so he can not get away with hurting other women like myself. The cheating and the lies. In the comments, he later revealed that the letter had been sent to all of his neighbours too. Reddit users were quick to share their thoughts on the note, with many saying they thought the culprit was a competing restaurant owner.One person said: Love the random sentence at the end like it’s the title of the next chapter, to which the original poster jokingly replied: Like Bridgertonit was st century eh  Another put: Weaposve been left on a clfhanger. Has a new restaurant opened up nearby that one by any chance  asked a third. Someone  wondered the same and said: Odds on for this being the owner of a competing restaurant. It actually could well be, said the original poster. The person posting it was wearing a mask and had their hood up on their raincoat despite it being dry out. Another user couldnapost help but add: I’ll bet they were hiding their chef whites and chef’s hat under their coat.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

You know how we lather our legs up and we shave and we shave and we do all that, right  Wrong!Try this instead. Shave but don’t lt it. Shave but don’t lt it. It literally took me five seconds per leg to shave my legs this morning. That is the fastest it’s ever taken me in my le and you can go over your knees too and it won’t cut you up.

Instead, at a press conference on Monday, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe calmly explained that she’d found it hard to trust foreign secretaries after so many let her down. “What’s happened now should have happened six years ago. I shouldn’t have been in prison for six years,” she said, not even raising her voice. Within hours, the appalling hashtags #sendherback and #ungrateful were trending on Twitter. Angela from Worcestershire called in to Channel ’s The Jeremy Vine Show to say: “For her, now she’s back, in her first interview, to turn round and blame our ­government is an ungrateful thing to do.”Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Jason from Milborne Port agreed on Nick Ferrari’s LBC radio show. “It would have been nice for her to say thank you,” he moaned.For the record, the first words out of Nazanin ’s mouth at the press conference were: “I would like to begin by saying that I am very grateful to whoever has been involved in getting us home, from politicians, to media members, whoever has been trying very hard to get our voices heard.”She then gave a long list of thank yous. She used the word “grateful” so many times I lost count. But because she didn’t just sit prettily in front of the cameras and smile appreciatively, because this woman who has lost six years of her le – her marriage, her daughter’s childhood – dared address the elephant in the room, she’s now being berated. It’s outrageous, insulting, misogynistic. Cheer up, love – OK, it did happen, but you’re home now so count yourself lucky. She didn’t even mention Boris Johnson, whose ­incompetence when he was the foreign secretary tasked with helping her sealed her fate further instead. He wrongly announced she was “teaching people journalism” – a statement that days later was cited in Iranian court proceedings as proof she was engaged in ­“propaganda against the regime”. It’s something that must surely have played on her mind every now and then as she sat in her cell for years and years and years.Heroic MP Tulip Siddiq, who worked tirelessly to free her constituent, revealed this week that, “This disastrous blunder meant Johnson was forced to meet us. Incredibly, he askedRichard had enjoyed his visit to Iran.“Anyone who had read a newspaper article on the case was aware that Richard had been at home in the UK when his we was arrested in Iran. To this day, I feel astonished by Johnson’s extremely poor grasp of his brief. ” The simple truth is that Nazanin has a lot to be angry about. She was an innocent pawn in a game between two governments arguing over a £million debt for a cancelled arms deal. She was held for ransom, and left to rot. Then, six long years later, the Tories who run this country may need Iranian oil, so they suddenly decide to do the right thing and rescue her… and she’s supposed to be grateful  Are you kidding  Jeremy Hunt, one of the other foreign secretaries who failed her said yesterday: “Those criticising Nazanin have got it so wrong. She doesn’t owe us gratitude: we owe her an explanation.” Too right.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ParentingNazanin Zaghari-RatclfeIranWomen\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He entered the car she was using for the morning school run in Brisbane, Australia, before telling Ms Clarke: I wanted to see my children and telling her to get out.Despite suffering burns to % of her body, brave Hannah managed to summon the energy to tell paramedics and police what happened.An inquest heard how Hannah told first paramedic on the scene, Stephanie Ring: My babies are in the car, my children are in the car. Why didnapost I just stay in the car with them  Baxter, , then took his own le after burning the mum and three children to death.  He had previously rejected an offer to share custody of his three children with Hannah before launching the horric attack. Baxter allegedly kidnapped his six-year-old daughter on Boxing Day last year, which allowed Ms Clarke to get a domestic violence orderagainst him. On the opening day of the inquest, a neighbour described Hannah as amazingly strong, as she tried to stop Baxteraposs attack and save her children. The neighbour told how she heard her screaming: Call the police, heaposs trying to kill me, heaposs put petrol on me. CCTV footage also showed Baxter at a DIY shop buying the jerry can used in the attack, reports NEWS. It was understood in the lead up to her death she had been experiencing increasing levels of violence and coercive control. The inquest is also set to call witnesses including counsellors and police, who helped Hannah during the breakdown of her marriage - as well as a support worker who took a call from Baxter  hours before he killed his family in . Hannahaposs parents Lloyd and Sue Clarke have since dedicated their lives to preventing domestic abuse and raising awareness.  Mr Clarke told Daily Mail Australia: Rowan must have been lurking somewhere close, either hidden around the side of the house or in the neighbouraposs driveway. His car was found down the street, this was definitely premeditated. Speaking of their grandchildren, they said: They were young, vibrant… beautul people... she loved her children.

Ukrainian intelligence officials claimed yesterday to have discovered a plot to remove Putin from his presidency, over fears that economic sanctions will cripple the country.The elite circle in Moscow is said to fear that the countryaposs brutal war could lead to further ramications for them. Now they are reportedly considering a range of options to replace him - including faking an accident or poisoning the brutal leader. His former friend Alexander Bortnikov, who was previously sanctioned by the US, is said to be in the running to replace him.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here  He is the current director of Russiaaposs FSB - a role previously held by Putin - and was regarded as an influential member of the Presidentaposs small inner circle. Bortnikov previously served in the KGB and met Putin while they were both stationed in Leningrad - now Saint Petersburg - in the s. Since being appointed to the top role in , he is said to rule with an iron fist, to ensure Putinaposs regime continues. The shadowy organisation - which Putin relies on for all his intelligence - is at the heart of the Russian government, with Dossier Center describing it as a “state within the state. After Putin became President, he appointed Bortnikov as the head of Russiaaposs Economic Security Service, where he wielded a huge amount of power. In , it was claimed that Bortnikov allegedly oversaw the operation to assassinate Alexander Litvinenko on British soil. The agency is also believed to be responsible for the poisoning of Alexei Navalny under Mr Bortnikov’s order. Russia and Bortnikov deny any involvement in the deaths.  And in , Bortnikov was accused of holding a pro-Stalin attitude, after a group of academics claimed he was legitimising the mass purges carried out under Joseph Stalin, which were dubbed the Great Terror. At the time, he told a paper that archives showed that a signicant part of the criminal cases of those killed had an objective side to them.Now intelligence agents claim powerful figures in Russia have chosen the spymaster as they believe he can help restore economic ties with the West. Their goal is to remove Putin from power as soon as possible and restore economic ties with the West, destroyed due to the war in Ukraine, the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine said.It is known that Bortnikov and some other influential representatives of the Russian elite are considering ious options to remove Putin from power. In particular, poisoning, sudden disease, or any other ‘coincidence’ is not excluded. Itaposs thought the relationship between Putin and Bortnikov has become strained - with the spymaster blamed for allowing his military commanders to be overwhelmed by the fierce Ukrainian defence. Putin is said to be displeased with the FSB thanks to failures with the intelligence secured during the war. Deputy Vyacheslav Ushakov has already been sacked. One intelligence source told the Mirror: It is noteworthy that Bortnikov has recently been disgraced by the Russian dictator. “The official reason for the disgrace of the FSB leader – fatal miscalculations in the war against Ukraine. “Bortnikov and his department were responsible for analysing the mood of Ukraine and the ability of the Ukrainian army.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Alexander BortnikovJoe BidenAlexander LitvinenkoJoseph StalinDmitry MedvedevVladimir PutinBritish ArmyThe Washington Post CompanyArmed forcesShopping centres\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#.

I’ve looked forward to this date since we entered and it’s what I’ve been working towards. My aim is to defend my gold,possible, but I want to see how well I can do and give him [his dad] a good run for his money.“I’ve made a few changes to my training, my bike and my run style slightly so we’ll see how that all pays off, but I love racing at Oulton Park, it’s a really nice track, a lovely atmosphere, it should be a really good day of racing.”Preparing to defend his M- British title, Leahn added: “This time around it’s at the beginning of the year so it’s going to be interesting, especially as the fields are much deeper this year which is great because that’s what it should be for a British Championships. But I’m going there to try and defend my title, I’ve got a taste for it now after last year and then it’s building up to the Worlds and Europeans later in the year.”Reflecting on the moment they shared on the podium together, Leahn said: “It was such a proud moment to see Dylan on the podium and to be able to share it with him made it even more special.“You are focused on your own race and your own effort, and it can be hard to work out who is in which age group when you’re racing, so until you cross the line you never really know where you’ve placed.“So, to find out I had won and then to see Dylan crossing the line to win his age group was a really nice feeling, especially having seen all the training and hard work he put in last year. It was a nice surprise to be driving home with two gold medals in the car.”.removeLast year’s championships was Dylan’s first standard distance duathlon and his first experience of a British Championships.“I had raced at Oulton Park earlier in the summer, so I knew the track and I really enjoyed racing there,” Dylan said. “I felt a lot more confident in October than at the race in June, but it was a whole new experience for me because it was across a distance I had never raced before.“It was a lot of unknowns, a lot of guess work, but it was an amazing feeling to cross the line and to be told you’re British champion. To be able to stand on the podium with my dad was amazing.”Last year saw Leahn claim world bronze at the World Triathlon Duathlon Championships in Spain. Later this year he will be back in Spain for the European Standard Distance Duathlon Championships in September, when he will be joined on the GB Age-Group Team by Dylan for the first time.“I’ve had the opportunity to travel and compete in dferent places and meet so many dferent people at races who I genuinely call friends, and now seeing the development and progression of Dylan within the sport is fantastic,” Leahn said.“When Dylan was youngerI was doing a long run, he would cycle alongside me and then at the weekend we would both run. Now we’ll do sessions together, we train together after Dylan comes home from school or at the weekend, and we also compete against each other at cross country. I’m so proud of him to see how he’s come from someone who used to follow me around on the bike to now I’m following him, and that’s purely down to his own effort and determination.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted. Returning alongside St Kentigern for further instructions.’There was a lull in the activities while the leboat resumed its operations. They tried again- without success.Then came the news at . hours – ‘St Kentigern Refloated.’The leboat has succeeded in its third attempt, against odds.The St Kentigern then proceeded to Campbeltown under her own power, while the leboat escorted her, but first it took in tow the coaster’s own leboat, which it had earlier lowered over the port side in case of an emergency.The Ardchattern also accompanied the Saint Kentigern to Campbeltown.Meantime, the two remaining ships, Lairdsdale and Brora, seeing their attendance was no longer required, sent a parting signal of good-luck to the coaster and continued on their respective passages to towards the Irish Coast."},{"url":null,"title":"information is key in kintyre","story":"Campbeltown-based Keeping it local CICis introducing the screens up and down the peninsula, including Tarbert and on the Isle of Gigha.A spokesperson for the community interest company said: #With the support of fantastic businesses all over we are able to provide up-to-date information on events, news, travel and destination areas to visit all around the area at the touch of a button.#The work we do is also supported by advertising on our screens while promoting your own business offerings.#The boards should be up and running by April, all being well.The aim of Keeping it local CIC is to support businesses, trades, services and events by collating information and bringing all that Kintyre has to offer under one roof # a one-stop-shop for the consumer and businesses.The Tarbert information boards are due to be located at One Fyne Deli and at The Gather restaurant."},{"url":null,"title":"island residents and friends have a happy 20th gigha day","story":"Celebrations were in full swing this week as residents on the Isle of Gigha marked  years of community ownership.After extensive community fundraising alongside securing grants and loans from Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the National Lottery, Gigha was purchased by the community for the sum of £m on March  .On this day the island was handed over to the Isle of Gigha Heritage Trusta day that is marked on the island every year as #Gigha Day#.To commemorate this -year milestone all Gigha residents and key island stakeholders were invited to watch Gigha’s eldest female resident Ina McNeill raise the island flag on Tuesday.This was followed by a display from the pupils of Gigha Primary School and a performance by the Kintyre Schools Pipe Band, who made the journey over from Campbeltown to attend.The Isle of Gigha Hotel then welcomed the guests for refreshments and to view a display of island memorabilia and photographs from the past  years.Since the buyout the permanent population of the island has grown from around  up to  residents.This has been achieved through housing renovations and new affordable housing, coupled with increased economic development.Gigha has several businesses which support employment on the island and IGHT now employs  people across its office, maintenance team, Achamore Gardens, new campsite, marketing, and ranger service.This includes two apprentices who are contributing to the restoration of Achamore Gardens.The trust is managed by a board of voluntary directors who are elected by the membership to develop the assets of the island and take forward plans and projects for the community.IGHT  retains ownership of the majority of the built and land assets of the island, worth over £m.Since the buy-out in  IGHT has renovated  houses as part of an ongoing investment programme, sold  plots for private self-build development, developed four wind turbines which help fund development, installed moorings and pontoon facilities, successfully marketed Gigha’s tourism assets as well as working to protect and conserve Gigha’s heritage and environment.One of the trust’s biggest challenges has been managing its financial position.The trust’s debt levels increased to £.m in  after taking out loans to deliver housing renovations.This debt burden is now reduced to £,, which has been achieved through asset sales and income from its renewable and trading companies.The trust has a number of projects underway including a new campsite, km of new and upgraded path networks, on-site and online heritage interpretation, five new housing units, and a -year restoration plan for Achamore Gardens.The trust is actively trying to reduce the island#s carbon footprint through  e-bikes for hire from the activity centre and is also soon to install the island#s first electric vehicle charging point."},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 11 2022 2","story":"So the Scottish Government remains adamant in its decision to ban creelers from the Clyde for the next two months or so.We#re not talking North Sea trawlers here that can go where in the interim.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

That all has planning approval and work will proceed on site before the summer. However, a group of concerned parents were at the same time looking for a site to locate a skate park and pump track in Dunbar they did a presentation to the community council on their ideas. I have for the last several months been working with these parents and iniduals.We are aware that skateboarding and BMX bikes are now Olympic sports and the idea of linking these facilities with the fantastic sporting facilities we have at Hallhill developed into the idea of locating it on the land we have available at Lochend. We have been developing this idea and, along with the changing rooms, we feel that a community cafe would be fantastic for our young people when they use this area. It would provide some supervision for the area and provide toilets and refreshments for the people using the facility.We are all aware of the anti-social behaviour that has been taking place within our community. Our young people are currently using Lochend Woods at nights and over the weekends to meet up but have no supervision and are getting involved in anti-social behaviour. We see lots of complaints about our young people on social media and now all young people have been banned from using McDonald’s in the evenings. The situation will not improve and will become dangerous unless we do something to support them. We need to provide these young people somewhere they can meet up in a safe area along with some supervision.The outdoor activity can be used by anyone despite their age, sex or ability. I would expect to see adults and children using this facility at the same time along with some quality coaching in all activities. We are fortunate in Dunbar that many of our young people use skateboards, scooters, roller skates and bikes they will all benefit from using this facility. My hope is all our young people can feel this is a place they can come and feel safe and be involved, or just sit in the cafe with friends for a chat.As for the woodland, I am fully committed to doing everything I can to protect it and the wildle within it. We need to find a way of engaging with our young people to respect it and support the work we need to do protect it and its wildle. I hope the new centre will make young people think they are part of the community woodland and will want to be involved.I am committed to delivering this project on the ground quickly, as I did with the Hallhill Sports Complex that was £ million.

Today they are front page news, displacing the latest bulletins from a nation fighting for its le against a new, frightful version of fascism.What kind of mindset can that be – navel-gazing about a timeline while the rest of the world focuses on Russia, Ukraine and how to prevent more human suffering, and aworld war Don’t we have enough international disgrace already, from a UK Government compromised by decades of corrupt Russian money-laundering through the City of London, from its “hostile environment” policies towards refugees, from its cynical Brexit lies  That same verbally incontinent Prime Minister has just horrically compared Ukraine’s fight for its le to his Brexit, so that on this day, having aroused international revulsion, he has caused the UK to be excluded from a European summit on Ukraine.Of course I believe the timing of a referendum on Scottish independence takes second place for most people in Scotland just now, while we try to counteract the shameful behaviour of Westminster towards Ukraine and all refugees.The ghastly motivation of that “poll” however – and the rotten aftermath – has just confirmed how desperately Scotland needs her own voice Europe and the rest of the world would surely be very glad of it too.Frances McKie, Evanton.* DR Jonathan Eyal thinks sidelining democracy in Scotland will displease and deter Vladimir Putin from his machinations: this after President Putin was “recruited” by David Cameron in .I doubt Scotland looms large in Mr Putin’s calculations, when he has already, inexplicably, elected to make Russia a pariah state. Independence for Scotland will hardly render the “rump UK” much weaker, given there would certainly be a negotiated short-term accommodation for Trident.The Union has been a disaster, Scotland having been stripped of its commercial industrial assets its population and economy stagnant for a century. Other than Trident, Scotland retains no military presence of any strategic value.Dr Eyal should yoke his enviable intellectual powers to the task of guessing what Mr Putin’s next play, or endgame is. One thing is certain – it has zero relevance to Scotland’s democratic future.GR Weir, Ochiltree.CURRENCY NOT A PROBLEM FOR SCOTLANDJILL Stephensonis in a time warp over currency in an independent Scotland.Several European countries have created and launched a new currency quickly and effectively, under far more dficult circumstances than would be the case with Scotland leaving the UK. Establishing a central bank, to manage the new currency, is a task that many other countries have managed successfully and sometimes even before they are fully independent.Every country in the world uses its own currency, or one tied to a fully-convertible counter, and finds no trouble in doing so. In an independent Scotland our citizens would use whatever currency was accepted in shops, bars, online shopping, investments and tax payments. Like some other countries, Scotland could even run multiple currencies, as the technology is there to handle multicurrency transactions. Banks are perfectly capable of issuing multicurrency accounts.As one of the wealthiest countries on the planet, Scotland will choose the currency option best suited to our needs, but in a situation like the Covid- pandemic, having one’s own independent currency would have allowed Scotland to borrow and continue with widescale testing while supporting the economy without having to beg the UK to borrow on our behalf.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh.OUR NATION IS TOTALLY DIVIDEDAS we approach  years of SNP rule in Scotland and with local elections in May, it is worth considering what has happened in Scotland over these years. Unfortunately it is a reflection that is deeply troubling for our nation.We are governed by a political party with a single mission and focus to the detriment of all , as demonstrated by a list too long to describe in full. Some of these failures are hugely impactful on the everyday lives of voters – in education, health, transport and the economy. Year after year we are promised that things will get better but we have higher taxes, quangos everywhere and a Government bereft of ideas save that independence will cure all our ills.However, the most disappointing and, yes, hurtful result of this last  years of SNP rule is how, as a once proud and indeed global nation, we have become completely ided, insular and look to blame all our ills on someone . A grievance culture is alive and well in our nation. We now have ided families, friends and colleagues to a degree that one questions whether that ision can ever be healed regardless of whether another independence referendum is held.The conceit and arrogance demonstrated on a daily basis by this utterly incompetent Government must stop. The only way to show our contempt is to give the SNP a very bloody nose in the May local elections.Richard Allison, Edinburgh.NATO SHOULD MAKE PUTIN THINKNATO’s stance of ruling out any intervention in Ukraine makes Vladimir Putin believe he can get off with anythinghe doesn’t attack Nato members. This could lead to him continuing to flatten Ukrainian cities and annexing the whole of Ukraine into the Russian Federation. He might then move against Georgia and Moldova, both outside Nato and already containing Russian-backed separatist enclaves and troops. These conquests might let Russia build up its economy and military to a level where it and China could challenge Nato.Sanctions aren’t guaranteed to work. North Korea has been under draconian sanctions intended to stop its nuclear weapons programme for decades. Yet it’s built an estimated  to  warheads, with capability to make seven more annually.Nato should change its publicly-stated position to considering its options in Ukraine. And make it clear the reasons include war crimes like indiscriminate rocket fire and targeting of civilians Russian forces not allowing civilians to escape to EU countries, and not allowing aid, food and water into cities they are besieging plus the lack of a negotiated peace deal between Russia and Ukraine after a month of war.This could put enough doubt in President Putin’s mind to make him agree a negotiated peace that he could sell as victory to the Russian public by getting Donetsk, Luhansk, Crimea, and a neutral Ukraine, but leaving it an independent country with an elected government.Nato should also warn any use of tactical nuclear weapons would have military consequences.But Volodymyr Zelenskyy should also offer to lt the suspension of Ukrainian parties which back joining a trade bloc with Russia rather than the EU as part of any peace deal. If President Putin thinks no government can be elected backing this policy in Ukraine, a peace deal is less likely.Duncan McFarlane, Carluke.* I THOUGHT everyone was entitled to a fair trial under our ever so fair democratic values.So how would Vladimir Putin fare under a Special War Crimes Court, such as proposed by Gordon Brown and others Joe Biden, the President of the United States, no less, and Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the UK, and many other leaders under the influence of the US, of course, have already declared that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal.

Orkney Islands Council has announced that it will be installing card payment machines in its car parks, thanks to a boost from the Scottish Government.New ticket machines being installed in the coming weeks will offer contactless and chip and pin card payments.Work to install the machines – which will also accept coins – starts from Monday  March.The new machines are fully funded by the Scottish Government Place Based Investment Programme Capital Fund.All new machines are expected to be in place by the end of March.OIC’s roads support manager, Kenny Roy, said: “The existing machines require more and more maintenance now and are due to be replaced.“The option to pay by card has been a growing request over the past few years from our community and visitors, so we’re pleased to have secured funding from the Scottish Government to help us invest in that option.”Once works start, there will be periods during the installation of new power supplies and of the new machines, when parking in the car parks affected will be free of charge due to temporary unavailability of the machines.All other conditions of the car park order will continue to apply and be enforced, such as maximum stays and parking within marked bays.Drivers are being asked by the council to continue to use the bays in the short stay “pay and display” car parks for a maximum of three hours to ensure a turnover of available spaces. You should always check whether the machine is working and not assume free parking is available.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The day is open to all ages and sexes, so please bring your kids along also.”Previously, Orkney enjoyed success in the North of Scotland Cricket Association.Mr Rae continues: “If we can get back to that level, it’d be a huge bonus. At this stage it’s just baby steps, andthe interest is enough, we’d like to resurrect the indoor winter league, which hasn’t been played since  .“If there is enough interest over in Caithness, we’d like to get the inter-county going too. The tours we used to do in August were also very popular, playing a game at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire while the royal family was in residence.”Communication through their Facebook page has been encouraging, boosting Mr Rae and others that there is renewed interest in raising the profile of the sport once more.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population. Instead, our advice will be thatyou have symptoms of COVID — or indeed symptoms of the flu, or any other infectious illness — you should stay at home in order to aid your recovery.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We’re hearing of some food bank users declining potatoes and root veg because they can’t afford the energy to boil them,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.Mr Sunak is expected to link strengthening the UK economy to opposing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, but he is under pressure to address the domestic crisis.“So when I talk about security, yes, I mean responding to the war in Ukraine,” he is poised to tell the House of Commons.“But I also mean the security of a faster-growing economy, the security of more resilient public finances, and security for working families as we help with the cost of living.”The Financial Times reported on Tuesday evening that forecasts in the statement will show the deficit is better than expected this year, to the tune of £ billion.However, the newspaper said Mr Sunak is planning to set aside a large part of this windfall cash – rather than investing the full sum in driving down the cost of living.Energy bills are soaring, inflation is at its highest in decades. Yet the Tories are choosing to raise taxes on working people.Tomorrow the Chancellor must halt the National Insurance hike and back our windfall tax to cut the cost of gas and electricity. https:t.co XKAYmajGNJ— James MurrayMarch , Labour’s shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: “As he heads into his spring statement, he can either choose an unfair tax rise on working people and business at the worst possible time, or he can cancel his tax rise and ease the cost of living hitting families by cutting energy bills by up to £ through bringing in a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits.”The rocketing energy bills faced by households have been caused in part by a post-pandemic rise in demand for gas, with lower levels of production. This was only exacerbated by the war in Ukraine.A planned hike in NI contributions, combined with forecasts that wages will rise slower than inflation, will also take a toll.Delivering greater economic security for our people, accelerating growth and productivity, and making sure the proceeds of that growth are shared fairly.That is not the work of any one statement. But that work begins tomorrow.The Spring Statement starts at .. pic ZbflaC— Rishi SunakMarch , A briefing from the House of Commons library said the cost of living across the UK has been rising since early , while in January this year inflation reached its highest recorded level since .The Chancellor has already announced a £ loan for gas and electricity payments from October – although not until the price cap jumps %.In addition, certain households will get a £ council tax rebate in April.The Treasury said the measures announced so far add up to around £ billion of support this year, taking in the rebate, changes to Universal Credit and the freezing of fuel and alcohol duties.Mr Sunak is also expected to set out how the Government plans to create a new culture of enterprise, helping the private sector to train, invest, and innovate more.Other options available to the Chancellor include adjustments to VAT in certain sectors and an uprating of benefits in line with new inflation forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-275-march-21-wordle-word-hints-todays-answer  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

A key element of the Review was to gain insights from interested stakeholders and the wider public on the future of rail on the island of Ireland. With over , responses to the consultation, both Ministers received an update from consultants ARUP on the initial findings from this phase of the Review at a progress meeting today.  Minister Nichola Mallon said: “Minister Ryan and I have a shared ambition for rail and are committed to improving our network for citizens across the island through our All Island Strategic Rail Review. The public consultation phase was a vital step in delivering this important piece of work and I am delighted to have delivered this key stage. Today we met with the consultants at ARUP, along with Minister Ryan to hear the out-workings of the consultation, to understand the views of the public and stakeholders and to ensure that their priorities are a focal point of the Review as it moves forward. “With over , responses received, this highlights that this work is long overdue and has captured the imagination of the public across the whole island. In that regard, the consultation has clearly demonstrated that our citizens view decarbonisation and enhancing connectivity as key components of this Review and these factors will play a strong role as we move forward to the next stage. “Minister Ryan and I have ensured now that working in partnership the next steps will move at pace. The next phase now will see ARUP analyse the comments and feedback received to ensure that the final report fully considers the views of our citizens when published by the end of the year. “This is an exciting opportunity for people, communities and our island economy. The benefits of enhanced rail connections cross Ireland will improve lives and have signicant benefits that a better connected island could bring not just to people but also for our environment. I believe that this is our chance to deliver real and lasting change. I’m proud that in government, Minister Ryan and I have shown that working together in the interests of people works and I hope we can continue working closely to see delivery on our aspirations for all island rail.” Minister Ryan said:“I’m delighted with the progress of the All-Island Strategic Rail Review. The incredible public response has shown the importance of rail for regional accessibility and demonstrated wide support for sustainable public transport. The public and stakeholders’ ambitions for the future of passenger and freight rail transport will play a signicant role in the future work of the Review, informing concepts to enhance the rail network and, in doing so, enhance connectivity, drive decarbonisation and support sustainable social and economic development. “Minister Mallon and I are committed to increasing low-carbon mobility and regional accessibility. Through rail we can sustainably enhance connectivity to improve the quality of le for all citizens on the island of Ireland.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1648027003458.jpg--ministers_welcome_report_aimed_at_producing_a_21st_century_high_street.jpg?1648027006000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220323newsministers welcome report aimed at producing a 21st century high street","story":"Junior Ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney have welcomed the publication of the Executive’s High Street Task Force report ‘Delivering a st Century High Street’, along with its  recommendations. The Junior Ministers, who are joint chairs of the task force, were presented with the report today by High Street Task Force members Glyn Roberts, Retail NI Seamus McAleavey, NICVA and Cathy Reynolds, SOLACE and paid tribute to the work carried out and the collaboration involved from both inside and outside of government. Junior Minister Gary Middleton said: “Our high streets have experienced constant and increasing change, particularly in recent years. “We want to empower people and communities to reshape and repurpose their local villages, towns and cities, to create a more erse high street - high streets that are clean, green, family friendly destinations that are welcoming for everyone. “I want to thank the High Street Task Force for bringing forward this report which has been developed to prioritise those actions that can drive delivery and build momentum. “A joined-up and collaborative approach must continue over the coming years to deliver high streets, village, town and city centres that are fit for the st century and this report provides the next steps for the new Ministers in the next mandate to take forward work to revitalise our village, town and city centres.” Junior Minister Declan Kearney said: “We want to see our cities, towns and villages regain and retain their vibrancy, purpose and sense of place. High streets of the future should be safe and attractive gathering points for whole communities, where people can live, work, shop, learn, do business, use public services and enjoy their leisure time. “The High Street Task Force report provides a long-term focus on addressing the transformation of our high streets and recognises that there will be a requirement for a number of short, medium and longer-term interventions. “I want to thank Task Force for their hard work and commitment to date and commend the joint-working and co-design roles played by departments, retail and other business organisations, trade unions, local councils and the community and voluntary sectors. “I believe this report and its recommendations can play a vital role in revitalising our high streets.” Glyn Roberts, Retail NI Chief Executive and Chair of the High Street Task Force – Influencing Policy and Strategy sub-group, said: “This report sets out proposals for a five year reconstruction plan for our high streets, reform of our business rates and the need to improve our retail planning policy. “We hope that an incoming Executive after the election will hit the ground running with this plan and begin the long road of recovery for our high streets.” Seamus McAleavey, Chief Executive of NICVA and member of the High Street Task Force – Developing Capacity sub-group, said: “It is obvious change is happening. We are in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it has speeded up during the Covid pandemic by necessity. Online commerce is the norm and communities need to re-invent there town centres. “Only a new vision will work as the past is the past. Communities are the heart of the city, town and villages centres. We can build vibrant high streets places people want to work in, shop in and enjoy themselves in. It is achievable.” Cathy Reynolds, Director of City Regeneration and Development, Place and Economy Department, Belfast City Council, and representing SOLACE , said: “Our high streets have experienced signicant change and challenges over recent years and it is critical that there is a focused effort to address these challenges and build on opportunities to ensure the future sustainability of our towns and cities. “A long term sustained approach is required to ensure high streets are supported to thrive and most importantly survive.” The High Street Task Force report and its recommendations will be subject to consideration by the next Executive who will determine how it can be aligned with the future Programme for Government."},{"url":null,"title":"if he hadnt got covid hed be doing well he had a good few years ahead of him","story":"Tyrone’s All-Ireland victory in  was bittersweet for the Bell family, just months after super-fan Laurence passed away and his brother James at a Tyrone game.

She has been nominated twice for the Royal Television Society award for presenter of the year.More recently, she made cameo appearances reading news bulletins in the hit Channel  comedy Derry Girls.Announcing her departure on Twitter, she said: “It is with deep sadness that, after almost  years, I am leaving the job that I love and resigning from BBC Northern Ireland with immediate effect.“Because this is the subject of ongoing tribunal and other legal proceedings, I am not able to respond to any questions or comments about my reason for leaving the organisation.”It is thought the journalist would no longer be the first-choice presenter for the flagship Newsline programme and would also have been required to work on Radio Ulster shows. Read MoreDonna Traynor back on the BBC – but as a character in comedy Give My Head PeaceDonna Traynor taking ‘age bias case’ against BBC, corporation insider claimsMost ReadBarry’s confirms Easter reopening as Portrush amusements set toas Curry’s Fun ParkCharles and Camilla greeted by schoolchildren on first visit to Co Tyrone townMotorists are warned to be alert after spate of hijackings across NIBelfast roads closed due to collapse of sewersEveryone will want a peek at £.m Co Down manor at mountainTop VideosPlayCharles and Camilla greeted by schoolchildren on first visit to Cookstown PlayExample of Javelin anti-tank missiles being sent to UkrainePlayWatch: Derry Girls stars spotted filming latest series at Barry’s Latest Northern IrelandOscars : Anxious wait for Covid-hit Ken Branagh and Ciaran Hinds with hopes pinned on BelfastCharlie McCann can be major boost to Northern Ireland after switching allegiance from the Republic, claims namesake AliCar, mobile phone and laptop stolen during south Belfast burglary involving kneBelfast woman Rachel Newhousesaddles up to add some spice to latest series of MasterChefChancellor Rishi Sunak should ease cost of living crisis by scrapping National Insurance rise, says Stormont minister Gordon LyonsLatestHolly Willoughby s to This Morning after bout of coronavirusCovid- pandemic could lead to rise in global TB cases, expert warnsInquest into death of The Jeremy Kyle Show guest Stephen Dymond is put backMP’s aide tells murder trial of ‘self-satisfaction’ of terror suspectLuke Marshall is a spiritual leader for Ulster, it’s great to have him back in contention after injury nightmare: Dan McFarland,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

According to the Commission, all MLAs were surveyed to assess the demand for the service and it agreed during a meeting last month “that the responses to the survey indicated that there was sufficient demand for the provision of simultaneous interpretation of Assembly business, as directed by the Assembly”.“Work on the practical arrangements, to put in place the simultaneous interpretation system has been, and is under way. The arrangements fall under two main categories, namely the equipment and infrastructure, and the personnel needed to provide the interpretation service,” a Commission spokesperson said.“With regard to the equipment and infrastructure, some of the equipment has already been delivered, installed and tested, with the balance of the equipment due in early April.“The required building and facilitation works, will be completed in a timely way, so that the simultaneous interpretation service can be operational at the start of the new mandate.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Installing the translation system in the Assembly chamber is estimated to cost around £,, while the annual running cost of the service will be around £,.The Commission said: “In relation to the personnel needed to deliver the interpretation service, three members of staff are required for each of the two languages, in order to provide and develop a consistent and secure service, meaning six in total.“Draft job descriptions have been prepared and the next stage will be to issue those to recruitment agencies.“The interpreters will initially be engaged on a temporary basis, with the level of service provision subsequently reviewed in line with the Assembly’s direction.”TUV leader Jim Allister has branded the plans “needless” and “farcical”, while the SDLP’s Patsy McGlone, on the other hand, “wholeheartedly” welcomed the news the service will be available from the beginning of the next mandate, although he was disappointed it has taken so long.“This will be a meaningful step for Irish language and Ulster Scots speakers across the North, not least the MLAs who will be looking to take advantage of these services. We have a growing number of Irish language speakers in the Assembly and will no doubt have more in future who will be able to make good use of it,” he said.“As a fluent Irish language speaker myself I know how much this will mean to our Irish language community who have been treated as second best for far too long. I hope this will be an important step to the introduction of full language rights for both our Irish and Ulster Scots communities, as agreed in NDNA.”People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll added: “Whilst it’s regrettable that this has taken such a long time to deliver and implement this, I fully support the provision of simultaneous translation services.“It’s important that English isn’t the only language heard in the Assembly chamber and other languages are spoken and catered for.”Related topicsNorthern Ireland AssemblyPatsy McGloneGerry CarrollJim AllisterMore On Northern Ireland AssemblyStormont watchdog ‘disappointed’ majority of recommendations by RHI Inquiry still not implemented PremiumMalachi O#DohertyOpinionSinn Fein’s mix of strategy and self-delusion is a recipe for confusion PremiumSome Northern Ireland firms feeling effects of sanctions on Russia PremiumClaire McNeillyOpinionDUP now a party that appears to be making it up as it goes along PremiumCall for unionist parties to stand aside in west Belfast for community candidate in Assembly electionMost ReadMotorists are warned to be alert after spate of hijackings across NIEveryone will want a peek at £.m Co Down manor at mountainBelfast roads closed due to collapse of sewersBarry’s confirms Easter reopening as Portrush amusements set toas Curry’s Fun ParkCharles and Camilla greeted by schoolchildren on first visit to Co Tyrone townTop VideosPlayCharles and Camilla greeted by schoolchildren on first visit to Cookstown PlayWatch: Derry Girls stars spotted filming latest series at Barry’s PlayJohn Travolta makes horric attempt at Irish accent as he lands in ShannonLatest Northern IrelandOscars : Anxious wait for Covid-hit Ken Branagh and Ciaran Hinds with hopes pinned on BelfastCharlie McCann can be major boost to Northern Ireland after switching allegiance from the Republic, claims namesake AliCar, mobile phone and laptop stolen during south Belfast burglary involving kneBelfast woman Rachel Newhousesaddles up to add some spice to latest series of MasterChefChancellor Rishi Sunak should ease cost of living crisis by scrapping National Insurance rise, says Stormont minister Gordon LyonsLatestMP’s aide tells murder trial of ‘self-satisfaction’ of terror suspectLuke Marshall is a spiritual leader for Ulster, it’s great to have him back in contention after injury nightmare: Dan McFarlandUK and Ireland submit initial bid to host Euro  – what happens next How much money will I savefuel duty is cut Ali Kirk admits the time is right to retire from road racing after losing his hunger to compete,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It has just become a bigger cost of living crisis because it has expanded to more people.“It’s time for those in charge to take a fresh look at the welfare system.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Unemployed people need support to help them get back into work but they also need jobs that pay enough to make working a viable option.”The former child-minder told how she found herself without work for a few weeks after losing her job just before Christmas.She currently works  hours a week working with children with special needs, earning £ a month, but she doesn’t get paid when the school is closed as she doesn’t have a permanent contract.“I was unemployed from just before Christmas until the end of January and when you’re in that position you have to take a job,” she said.Ms Rice has between £, and £, coming into the household each month, with which she must cover rent, food, electricity, home heating oil and the cost of running a car that she needs for work.“When you’re living month to month there are no savings,” she said.“I can’t afford bulk purchases, such as oil. I have a stove that heats the house, so we have been living on sticks and coal.“Coal has surged from £. last weekend to £. for a  kilo bag now. I can maybe stretch a week out of that.”She spends £ on monthly rent on her house, which has solar  on the roof which helps keep electricity costs down.Notwithstanding that, Caroline said she has noticed her bills going up.“Last year I would have spent a maximum of £ a month but I’m now looking at £,” she said.“When it comes to food, it’s on a ‘buy as you need’ basis as I don’t have a lot of money to spend in one go.“Milk used to be £. in our local supermarket, it’s now £.. Those small increases add up.”She added: “I stretch everything. I buy frozen chicken and frozen mince. I can’t afford to go to the local butcher. I’m always trying to look for cheaper alternatives.”Ms Rice said that le has become “almost unmanageable”, especially after being out of work for a short time.“When I had a flat wheel it was a choice between buying diesel or fixing the car,” she said.“I didn’t have the money to do both. There are no bus routes where I live. I need a car to get to work.”Caroline told how her young daughter is learning how to manage her money “because she knows money is going to be tightI have to pay for a school trip”.“She knows things are tough, and that makes me sad,” she said.“She has her birthday money and buys herself little treats, a croissant or a drink.“I don’t want her coming out of school at  or  or going to college and struggling… but we are trapped.”She called for the £ reduction in Universal Credit to be restored and said it would be helpfulthe Chancellor cut fuel duty to help drivers.She said she was “grateful” for the £ Executive payment scheme but that has already gone on electricity and oil.“Dual household incomes are currently struggling just imagine how hard it is for single income households.“People living on low incomes feel a deep shame because there’s a stigma around it.“There’s a lot of finger pointing at people on benefits.

But that could be about to change.Last year, the estimated repair bill for the clock, whose interior mechanism was removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, was in the region of pound,.Many are concerned to see the historic landmark falling into continued disrepair, but hopeful that it can be restored to be enjoyed for generations to come, reinforcing its connection with the villagersquos industrial past.Shrigley was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.The factory was powered by water supplied from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill mdash which is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash has long gone, the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Now there is fresh hope that it can be restored to its former glory.Strangford MLAs Michelle McIlveen and Harry Harvey, who have been campaigning for the clockrsquos restoration, are also hopeful that progress can be made.Welcoming the recent developments, they hope plans to acquire the clock and restore it to its former glory will prove successful.The MLAs said Housing Executive chief executive Grainia Long made it clear last year that the huge cost of repairing the historic clock was something the organisation was not willing to meet at the time.The housing chief said at a time when it was experiencing a signicant funding shortfall for investment in tenantsrsquo homes, it was not be appropriate to use income derived from rents to fund the considerable costs that would be required to undertake a full restoration of the Shrigley clock.Ms McIlveen and Mr Harvey then raised the issue with Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey, who has overall responsibility for the Historical Environment Division.They detailed the clockrsquos history and its local signicance, explaining that it is one of the last remaining pieces of Victorian architecture in Shrigley.The MLAs said it was ldquounacceptable that an old clock of such important signicance and splendour should be allowed to fall into such a sad state of disrepair.ldquoWe urged the communities minister to take the necessary steps to prevent this important listed monument from further deterioration and urged her to consider a partnership approach with ious interested bodies,

controversial decision to restructure the districtrsquos museum services is to be reviewed.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos decision to appoint a joint curator to oversee museum services in Downpatrick and Newry mdash which was taken without consulting local councillors mdash is to be reviewed by the local authorityrsquos Audit Committee.The newly appointed curator will be based in Newry, a move which has angered a number of councillors and highly respected organisations, including the Friends of the Down County Museum.Council officials have been accused of downgrading the status of the Downpatrick museum with stinging criticism continuing of the decision to have one curator in charge of the local authorityrsquos two museums.Council officials insist they are ldquofully committed to the continuous improvement and development of both museums and that updated staffing structures for both ldquoprovides an unparalleled opportunity to build in this work.The restructuring process has been referred to the Audit Committee by Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin, who is disappointed that despite signicant opposition to the move, the new joint curator is already in post.He wants the process which led to the councilrsquos decision to be reviewed, with the referral coming on the back of an update on the new staffing structure recently provided in secret to members of the local authorityrsquos Strategy, Policy and Resources Committee.Cllr Sharvin said while the press and public were prevented from hearing the update, he understands that the new curator will be based in Newry and shared across both museum sites.He continued: ldquoThe new staff structure is seen as an activity under the so-called scheme of delegation that enables the councilrsquos senior management team to conduct the change without the need to consult or inform any stakeholders in the process.ldquoThe new staff structure is currently being implemented and cannot be subject to change, as the roles have been offered out. We are told this is an operational matter that councillors are not involved in.Cllr Sharvin says he is disappointed to have to confirm that the new staff structure will be implemented at Down County Museum, which means it will have no permanent curator in the building.ldquoGiven the lack of information around the new roles and how the existing complement of skills are being integrated into the new museum structure, it can only raise concern as no one outside the senior management team have the information and understanding of how the fantastic services provided in Downpatrick will continue to be offered and delivered, he continued.ldquoThe campaign by the Friends of the Museum and the many groups associated with the Down County Museum was very much focused on the skills needed to run the museum and offer the excellent experience many hundreds of thousands of people have enjoyed over the years.Cllr Sharvin insists that a strategic review should have been undertaken first to understand the vision for the museum services in the district, design a plan around that vision and identy the staffing structure needed to support it.ldquoWhat has happened in this case, is that the staff structure is being implemented and a strategic review being held afterwards. The strategic review could easily identy that a dferent staffing structure is needed as opposed to the one being implemented now, he continued.ldquoI want to see the Down County Museum grow in size, reputation and service offerings. When you research the top  museums in Northern Ireland on Which Museum, the Downpatrick museum is placed th compared to Newry which is st.ldquoSimilarly on TripAdvisor, the Downpatrick museum is listed th, with Newry in th place. This shows a clear dference in status for each museum and where the councilrsquos main museum asset is.Councillor Sharvin explained he has referred the museum process and procedure to the councilrsquos Audit Committee for a number of reasons, even though he accepts the review will have no signicance in relation to the staffing structure as that will continue.However, he said the move will ensure that ldquolessons are learnt for any future changes and the Downpatrick museum is protected and respected.Cllr Sharvin explained the role of the audit committee is to review internal procedures and that is what he has asked to be examined.ldquoThere is no clear one approach when it comes to restructuring in council and the review of the procedures undertaken in this case will help the organisation identy were gaps are, what risks have been identied and the improvements that need to be implemented, he said.Cllr Sharvin said he has asked for a timeline of the start and completion of the strategic review being implemented and how key stakeholders such as the Friends of the Museum will be consulted as part of the process.He added: ldquoThe strategic review is now the focus of the campaign to ensure that the Down County Museum is not downgraded in any way.

chairwoman, Cathy Mason, following a recent meeting she had with senior council directors who provided her with a progress report.A detailed report on building the eagerly-awaited pound leisure centre is expected to be completed shortly, with senior council officials working with consultants to develop an outline business case which is designed to pave the way for construction work to start.The rear of the existing Newcastle Centre and the outdoor Tropicana swimming pool are to be bulldozed to make way for the new town centre leisure complex which will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.The new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which is a listed building, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Cllr Mason described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as ldquowelcome news and is delighted that the development plans are in the final stages of development.ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike, she said, confirming that the proposes new complex will feature a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.ldquoFor too long, people of Newcastle have had to put up with these substandard facilities, the chairwoman continued. ldquoThe plans highlighted safety concerns with the old part of the building which is to be demolished as it simply isnrsquot fit for purpose.Cllr Mason said she hopes to see the finalised plans and formal site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.ldquoIt is essential that the council moves in a timely manner to ensure this project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access these new facilities as soon as possible, said the chairwoman.ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure these much-needed leisure facilities are delivered and I will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to deliver these essential services right in the heart of communities.Last week, formal planning approval to bulldoze the rear extension of the existing Newcastle Centre and the adjoining Tropicana swimming pool was agreed by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed timescales are in place, politicians hope that major progress to deliver the project can now be made, with planning permission and all other associated approvals secured in a timely

extended to anyone who would like to attend.The club was formed in response to the growing interest in course angling at the river and with coronavirus restrictions largely gone, anglers have joined forces to form the new club and aim to encourage greater involvement in angling, particularly for coarse fish in the lower reaches of the River Quoile.The picturesque river is home to rudd, roach, hybrids, bream, pike, and eels.The new club is hoping to run a few competitions and, in the future, provide coaching courses for young anglers.A key concern for the new club is addressing the current state of the fishery which runs from the below the Belfast Road bridge to the Steamboat quay.The aim is to engage with a raft of statutory agencies to raise the profile of the river and its angling potential, alongside improved access for anglers and visitors.While there has been signicant investment over recent years and additional upgrades in the pipeline, the anglers will hope this paves the way for greater emphasis on the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset.Anglers say the Quoile basin is a designated nature reserve and, as such, there are ious regulations which govern its usage, with those who fish along its banks keen to maintain the waterwayrsquos biological ersity and general appearance, ensuring it is an asset everyone can enjoy.At the clubrsquos inaugural meeting

The EDAC race committee had an A and B routes on file in case of flooding on the Quoile towpath.They had worked with and through Covid- restrictions, secured road licences and Athletics NI permits, and employed professionals for timing, first aid and traffic management among others.The club rallied members and friends of the club to marshal the roads, man the water station and prepare the post race food tables.The race committee were out at am on Sunday to finalise the cones and signage when news broke that a fallen tree had brought down a power line directly impacting the planned route.East Down AC volunteers were straight into action. They were at the scene in minutes and had even a tree surgeon on speed dial, but they could not gain access.They were determined not to cancel and set about re-routing the race. This is not as simple as it may seem. With a traffic management plan to take into account and new sections to measure as well as the clock ticking, there was a lot of pressure.The wind and rain didnrsquot help and mindful of the wellbeing of runners, a delayed start was not even considered.With some sharp thinking and speedy manoeuvres a new route was hurriedly drawn up.Having advised the athletes that it was no longer a measured K, the start team herded them on to the start line in Ballydugan Estate and the hooter went only a minute or two behind schedule.With a huge sigh of relief Mags Mathieson, the official starter, waved the  strong crowd on their way. Thankfully everything  went to plan and post race comments have been nothing but positive from those who took part.There was high praise for the volunteers along the route, who cheered, clapped and gave out water. It was not the race that East Down AC had planned but with  fresh in our memories, most were simply glad that they got the chance to run.With all that had gone on pre-race there was barely time to consider who the winner might be, but there was a wave of excitement when Neil McCartan of East Down appeared in the home straight and crossed the line  seconds ahead of Owen Carleton of Annadale Striders.This was a bucket list moment for Neil as he is a longtime club member and he ran well to achieve it.It tops off a great season so far and leaves him primed for the track season which is his first love.

McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants presented Neil with the Jimmy Murray Memorial Shield at the finish line and the top three received cash prizes.The ladiesrsquo race was almost pre-determined when Emma Mitchell ndash the current , metre track championndash decided to throw her hat in the ring.However, given that she has been targeting half marathon timesand that the pandemic has played havoc with both racing and training, it is hard to gauge where iniduals are form wise.In the end she had a clear win finishing in . with Sinead Murtagh of Newcastle and District AC taking second place in ..Eimear McCracken of City of Lisburn came third in . to complete the podium.Emma was presented with the Joe Quinn Perpetual Trophy for first female and she took the time to say that she was delighted to support the magnicent Jimmyrsquos Ten and that the hospitality from the host club was first class.From an athlete who has raced at top level all over the world, it was praise indeed.Two shields are presented for club teams in the K and this year Newcastle and District took the honours in the menrsquos race and East Down AC retained the ladiesrsquo title.It is based on the top four men and the top three women home. There is also a relay event where two people split the K with one runner starting on the line and then passing over a wristband at the changeover point.Their team-mate then heads home to record a joint time. Ollie Robinson and Jacob Crawfordwere the quickest all male team.Holly Scott and Willow Farrington of Scrabo took the all female prize and the mixed title went to mother and son duo Maureen Kelly and James Wright .With the podiums decided the spectators turned their attention to looking for friends and family.The race is a highlight for local runners, many of whom do not belong to a club. This does not mean that they are not well able and plenty of fast times were recorded as the runners flooded in.Some were running to test their pace, some to seethey could run the distance with no speed in mind, others were raising funds or dedicating their run to causes.In short, there were all sorts of reasons and all sorts of runners but they were united in their efforts and the thrill of crossing a line to cheers.The fact that they were then brought to tables laden with food was a big surprise as for so long hospitality has been withdrawn, but with restrictions eased and a bit of careful planning the hosts were able to entertain their guests outside.Even the weather played ball by that stage as the rain had stopped and there were shreds of sunlight to lt the atmosphere.Jimmyrsquos Ten is always a memorable event but the  event will definitely be lodged in peoplersquos minds as the race that went ahead against all odds.EDAC would like to pay tribute to their full list of sponsors McMahon People Solutions, PCG Fitness, MC Dental Laboratories, Duffyrsquos Killough, JS Flooring, Murdock Brothers , P. Gardiner Carpets, Bells Supervalu Crossgar, McDonalds Downpatrick, Gordons Chemists, Plusprint, Wrap and Roll, McVeigh Traffic Management, Soaring Productions and main sponsor M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants. The financial backing is what makes this race an event.Thanks are also due to the members and even more so to those who are simply friends of the club, who give up their time to make the race happen. The hard graft that they put in cannot be underestimated.Finally, last but not least, there is heartfelt gratitude towards every single runner who signed up.Without runners there is no race. The smiles of the finishers and the kind words of support post race make all the hard work worthwhile. Well done and see you all next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Kilmore overrun Grove in league  ","story":"KILMORE Rec kept their promotion hopes on track with an impressive one-sided victory over a physical Grove United outfit at Robert Adams Park on Saturday.An early penalty kick converted by Anton McGrattan and two further second half goals from Eoin McGrattan and Joe McKinney was enough to see The Blues home and dry in bitterly cold yet sunny conditions.The Blues came firing out of the traps from the first whistle with Kilmore striker Joe McKinney the first to try his luck within the opening minutes, although his effort trickled harmlessly into the gloves of Grove number one Michael Davidson.However, it wouldnrsquot be long until the home side opened their account and after six minutes they were awarded the opportunity to do just that.Following a long ball over the top, Kilmore midfielder Eoin McGrattan spun his marker before he was clumsily clattered from behind inside the danger area.The referee had no hesitation in awarding the penalty kick, which Anton McGrattan dispatched confidently by drilling his effort low and hard to the bottom left corner beyond the reach of Davidson.The Bluesrsquo good start continued as they relentlessly pressed the opposition and didnrsquot allow Grove out of their own half.McKinney danced his way past three opposing defenders before his opportunity at goal was thwarted by a wonderfully timed last ditch tackle from Grove defender David McCallen.This wouldnrsquot deter the ever-dangerous Kilmore marksman, who continued to be a thorn in the side of his United counterparts when he battled to win back the ball before laying off team-mate Patrick Grant for a shot at goal.Grantrsquos effort did swing wide of the post but it was an encouraging sign for the Kilmore team, who clearly had their tails up.Man of the match, Barry Walsh, was enjoying the freedom of the middle of the park, as the Kilmore newcomer flung himself into every tackle necessary in order to gain possession for The Blues.Grove were very much stuck in first gear and were being overran in essentially every area of the park. Kilmore were dealt a blow when Grant came off second best in a crunching tackle with Grove defender Adam McKnight, leading to The Bluesrsquo defender to be substituted on  minutes.However, the silver lining for the hosts came in the form of substitute Joshua Smyth, who made an immediate impact when he entered the fray.Smyth quickly gained possession and whipped in a fast-paced cross to the head of incoming team-mate John McCarthy, whose effort was stunningly saved from point blank range by the reaction of Davidson in the Grove goals.This garnered applause from the sizeable home crowd, who had turned out to support their local side.With half an hour played, Kilmore looked to inflict further damage and almost did so following an eye-catching move which was unfortunate not to double the deficit.Smyth was yet again involved as he played a delicate one-two with the back heel of McKinney before his pass inside to the chest of Eoin McGrattan allowed the midfielder to find team-mate Michael Carvill unmarked at the edge of the box.Carvill unleashed an effort towards goal but it was smartly stopped yet again by Grove custodian Davidson, who was quickly becoming his sidersquos top performer.Any hint of a counterattack from the visitors was quickly dealt with by the confident backline of Christopher Magee, Gary Kennedy and captain Jack Larkin, with Magee in particular winning his inidual battle with Grove striker Jake Long time after time.With less than ten minutes to the interval, Carvill played a short free-kick to McCarthy, who swtly passed to Kennedy  yards from goal.After examining his options, the Kilmore defender decided to take a touch forward before firing a long ranged effort with conviction which ultimately crashed onto the post before falling to the feet of skipper Larkin.The Kilmore captain turned his rebound over the bar although his blushes were saved by the offside flag.Despite Grove proving they were a physically strong side ndash as they never shied away from a tackle ndash they failed to garner any substantial chance throughout the opening  minutes.The half ended with Grove midfielder David Johnston picking up a yellow card for a late challenge on Anton McGrattan.The first real opportunity of the second half fell to Kilmorersquos Walsh, who after a pinball of passes, saw his effort from the edge of the box saved.However, just two minutes later and The Blues would double their scoring tally after marksman McKinney latched on to a long ball before squaring his pass to team-mate Eoin McGrattan for an easy tap in.To their credit, Grove were certainly showing more of a presence in the opposing final third, although they were lacking the end product required to trouble the hosts.Kilmore continued to cause problems and goal-scorer Eoin McGrattan almost added another when he once again showed his marker a clean pair of heels and barrelled down on goal.This time his effort struck the side netting as Grove momentarily escaped conceding a third.The home side refused to settle for just two goals and were almost granted a third when McKinneyrsquos whizzing pass across the box marginally escaped the boot of the onrushing McCarthy.Grove managed to manufacture a seldom chance when captain Michael McNerlin struck a first time volley from  yards which required Kilmore lsquokeeper Christopher Turley to spring into action and tip the ball over the crossbar.However, this seemed to ignite the Kilmore flame further and with  minutes to go they registered their third, courtesy of a surging Walsh run which ended in a pass to McKinney inside the box.The Kilmore striker kept his cool and confidently placed his right footed effort into the net to drown out any chance of a dramatic comeback.Eoin McGrattan made way for substitute John Patterson, who almost added to the scoreline when once again McKinney was allowed to play a pass across goal.However, the substitute fluffed his lines and sent his effort over the bar in what was an escape for the now weathered looking Grove outfit.The visitors were gted a consolation goal in the th minute, after substitute David Long was adjudged to be fouled in the area by Kilmore captain Larkin.Grove midfielder Johnston confidently tucked his effort into the top right corner but seconds later the final whistle sounded.Following the match Kilmore goal-scorer, Anton McGrattan, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance.ldquoI thought we controlled the game, he said.ldquoWe could have gotten two or three goals before half-time but we didnrsquot panic.ldquoWe will just take it one game at a time now, we had a setback against Dromara Village a couple of weeks ago but we have now won two on the bounce.He added: ldquoThere is a massive week ahead, we travel to Rosario for a big three points.Kilmore Rec: C Turley, C Magee, P Grant, J Larkin , G Kennedy, B Walsh, J McCarthy, A McGrattan, J McKinney, M Carvill, E McGrattan.Subs: J Patterson, J Smyth, C

Rio De Janeiro, Love Island star Matthew MacNabb has tangoed his way into the semi-final of RTEacutersquos Dancing With The Stars.The  year-old will be flying the flag for Downpatrick and Northern Ireland on Sunday when he vies to get through to the final.It was a busy night for Matthew and his dance partner Laura Nolan, with two dances each to complete before the dance-off at the end of the show.They danced a sultry tango to Rio by Duran Duran with judge Arthur Gourounlian commenting after: ldquoMatthew, you brought the passion of Rio to the dance floor tonight.Fellow judge Brian Redmond said: ldquoYou started with intensity, commitment to the movement... its just the face thats missing at this stage, your body brought us on the journey.Loraine Barry, another judge, said: ldquoI like this Matthew, I felt you got yourself in the correct tango position.They scored  from the judges but they picked up extra points in the team dance for their group,Turkish Delights, were victorious.These points, combined with the public, kept Matthew safe from the dance-off.Nicolas Roche became the latest celebrity to exit as he and dance partner Karen Byrne lost out in this weeks

about.However, everyone -mdash including the DWTS judges mdash have noticed a certain spark between him and Laura.ldquoWersquove really grown close, admitted Matthew. ldquoI think with dancing, when yoursquore in this process, itrsquos so intense and yoursquore in each otherrsquos pockets for seven days a week and you become emotionally reliant on the person and vice versa.ldquoIt really is so intense and there is a lot of pressure because yoursquove got the whole nation watching you and yoursquove got the producers and your fellow contestants watching and you donrsquot want to let the

every day. I havenrsquot taken a day off in ten weeks.Matthew revealed he has met Laurarsquos parents and that he was planning what he called ldquoa two-person trip once the show comes to an end.When askedhe ever expected to get to the quarter-final of the show, he said, \"Itrsquos amazing to get this far. I had no expectation coming into it.\"I was never a performer, never danced in my le so it was a whole new world. Going into the show Irsquom rsquo \" so I never expected myself to be a good dancer, Irsquom not saying Irsquom a good dancer now but Irsquove definitely improved leaps and bounds since I started.ldquoIrsquom really buzzing at how far Irsquove progressed and hopefully Irsquoll keep that going and improve further from here.He said that he has found the physical demands of dance quite challenging and that his body is breaking down now.ldquoItrsquos constant because yoursquore twisting your body in new ways. Irsquove definitely got an emotional connection and itrsquos something Irsquoll keep up after the show is over, added Matthew.Check out Matthewrsquos progress on Dancing with the Stars this Sunday at .pm on RTEacute One..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Much respected  GP set to retire  ","story":"AFTER almost  years in practice, Dr Alison Smith is retiring next week as a GP in Dundrum and Clough.Health Minister Robin Swann paid a tribute to Dr Smith on a visit last week to the busy Clough surgery of the Dundrum and Clough Family Practice.Mr Swann met Dr Smith and her colleagues, who serve more than , patients in the South Down area.Dr Smith, who lives with her husband Tim in Newcastle, has specialist interests in womenrsquos health, diabetes, learning disability and care for the elderly.Mr Swann said: ldquoDr Smith and her colleagues have been at the forefront of innovations, in particular the implementation of the Multi-Disciplinary Teammodel in the Down Federation.ldquoThe recent extension to the premises here at Clough has been part of the roll-out of that initiative. The practice has recognised both the need for change, and the opportunity that new ways of working provides to improve the quality of care which it can offer to its patients.ldquoShe is an outstanding example of the dedication and professionalism of our GP services.The minister also thanked all of the practice staff or their ldquotireless and ongoing treatment, care and support that they provide to patients, particularly over the past two years.He added: ldquoI know it has not been easy. This has been an incredibly stressful and anxious time for so many of our population and no less so for our GP workforce and their teams who have been in the vanguard of our response to Covid.South Down UUP councillors Jill Macauley and Alan Lewis also paid tribute to Dr Smith.ldquoAlison has served the community of Clough and Dundrum with such attention and dedication over the years, and we have no doubt that her presence will be missed in the local surgeries, their statement said.ldquoWe thank our party colleague and Health Minister Robin Swann MLA for taking the time to call with Alison and all the staff at Clough Health Centre to acknowledge her retirement, as well as seeing around their impressive state of the art facilities.Dr Smith and her husband moved to the Newcastle area in  when he got a job at the YMCA.Originally from Edinburgh and having qualied at Edinburgh University, Dr Smith spent a short time working on the surgical ward of Downe Hospital with Mr Crawford Bell, consultant surgeon.She then worked part-time with Dr Edith Cunningham in Killyleagh and Dr John Kyle in Newcastle before joining the Dundrum and Clough Family Practice as a partner with Dr Kieran Walshe and Dr Alex Greer in .

This is history that we have actually been living and working through which has been good to have been part of that. But I definitely feel ready to move on and itrsquos time for new doctors to be in the practice.She said it was the speed of change that the practice had to contend with at the beginning of the lockdown that proved challenging.ldquoThere is always change in general practice and some of it is not easy but having to work safely through the pandemic while providing a service to our patients was challenging but I think we managed to do that.Dr Smith, who has three adult children mdash Alistair, Sandy and Corinne mdash added that it has been quite emotional for her saying goodbye to her patients over the last few weeks.ldquoThey are like old friends and it was good to be part of their lives.

This situation seemed to affect those at the lower end of the pay scale more.When the UK agreed to freedom of movement for people from poorer European countries and an inferior GDP, it opened up a can of worms as hundreds of thousands from these countries headed for the UK.The visa system should never have been done away with, but the EU demanded this movement and the Labour Party wanted to import votes therefore, a large swell of people headed for the UK.For this multi-million-pound company to get away with replacing their workers with cheap foreign labour, post-Brexit, would be a slap in the face for working class people - many of whom voted for Brexit because of such practices.This company knows that the UK needs them to carry freight across the Irish Sea and have played a fast one here.No compensation or offer can ease the hurt these workers must feel.This is a test for the government, and the unions, to demand that this firm reinstates these workers until such times as negotiations can take place.John Mulholland, DoaghClick here: Landmark libel win: Paper Trail case against News Letter collapses with plaintfs paying towards costsClick here for more opinion and letters: www.newsletter news opinion——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMark Drakeford is scheduled to announce the results of the latest review on Friday, while health minister Eluned Morgan will give a press conference at lunch time today, Tuesday, on the latest situation regarding Covid-.A spokesman for the Welsh Government said the future of policies like mask-wearing will be announced on Friday.Earlier this month, the first minister said he hoped the nations remaining rules could be scrapped at the end of this month, given the improving situation.But a recent rise in infection rates may yet cause a few bumps in the road out of the pandemic. In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon decided to keep mask rules in place there for another month, despite ending the rest of the nations Covid rules on Monday.It means people in Scotland must continue to wear face coverings on public transport and in shops - the same rules that we currently have in Wales - throughout April.England, however, has operated without any coronavirus rules for nearly one month, after Boris Johnson introduced his Living With Covid plan at the end of February.Public Health Wales confirmed , new cases on Monday , and nearly one in seven patients currently in Welsh hospitals has coronavirus. But infection rates remain well below the levels seen during the height of the Omicron wave in December and January. :Given the current Covid situation, the Argus asked the Welsh Governmentit was confident the nations remaining Covid restrictions would be lted when ministers reviewed the rules this week.We also askedthe Welsh Government believed it was currently safe to lt those restrictions.A spokesman for the government did not respond directly to those questions, but said: \"Throughout the pandemic we have kept regulations under regular review, with our approach being informed by the latest available scientic and medical advice. The outcome of the current -day review of regulations will be confirmed on March .\".removeEvenWales abandons its Covid rules on Friday, it is highly unlikely Mr Drakeford will follow the \"clf-edge\" approach seen in England. The first minister has criticised Mr Johnson for the abrupt end to restrictions over the border, and reinforced his own beliefs in the \"step by step\" strategy preferred in Wales.That strategy will involve a gradual winding down of most of the public-service response to coronavirus in Wales.Testing will continue here for the next three months, but lateral flow tests will be used instead of more expensive PCR tests during that time.Likewise, self-isolation policies will continue until the end of June, but they will become a matter of advice - not a legal requirement - from the end of March.We will bring you all the updates from Eluned Morgans Welsh Government coronavirus press conference at midday today, Tuesday. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWith England having removed all of its covid restrictions, it comes as little surprise that the Welsh Government is fielding calls to follow in Boris Johnson’s footsteps.Following this, it was announced that a decision will be made on the future of restrictions in Wales on Thursday, March , ahead of first minister Mark Drakeford’s three week review the following day - Friday, March .If the public health situation allows for it, an announcement lting restrictions in Wales will follow, the Welsh Government said.But, the BA. strain of covid has recently emerged, and it is growing – having overtaken omicron as the most prevalent iant in Wales.As a result, the situation is finely poised, with restrictions disappearing, additional measures being put in place, or continuing in an uneasy middle ground all on the table.Speaking at a briefing earlier today - Tuesday, March  - health minister Eluned Morgan summed it up, saying: “It is going to be a very finely balanced judgement in terms of whether we continue with our planned approach to releasing those final restrictions which we still have in place here.”Below, you can find out more about all of the moving parts in place, before the decision can be made.Why restrictions should be ltedNeighbouring England has lted all of its restrictions, and with many commuting across the border from Newport and Gwent - and vice-versa - there is a logical argument to bring the two nations in line.From a data point of view, Wales is actually in the best place of any of the home nations to lt restrictions.Wales currently has the lowest case rate in the UK - lower than England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.Health minister Eluned Morgan and The Grange hospital, one of the frontline hospitals in the fight against the virus What’s more, the omicron covid wave appears to be under control.Ms Morgan said: “Since the end of January, we have seen a steady decline in cases of coronavirus as the winter omicron wave receded”..removeSo, based on the above, all restrictions should be lted  Unfortunately, there are a number of other factors at play.Why restrictions should remainWhile omicron might be on the decline, there is a new menace in town – the BA. covid strain.In the last three weeks, the number of covid cases per , people in Wales has more than doubled, well above  per , people.BA. has also overtaken omicron as the most prevalent strain.BA. has now overtaken omicron But perhaps the biggest reason to keep restrictions in place is the pressure that the NHS once again finds itself under.There are more than , people in hospital with the virus, and, while most of these are not in intensive care, it is the highest hospitalisation rate since March .Simply put, the NHS is creaking once again.So, what decision can we expect It might sound like a bit of a cliché, but the decision as to whether restrictions will be lted could come down to the wire.The Welsh Government is set to make a decision on Thursday, before announcing it on Friday.Ms Morgan said: “It is going to be a very finely balanced judgement in terms of whether we continue with our planned approach to releasing those final restrictions which we still have in place here.\"There are no foregone conclusions. Were analysing the data, were giving ourselves as much time as we can. We will act in the best interest of the NHS and the public health in Wales.\"We have got to consider the pressures on the NHS at the minute. Our hospitals are full already. Any additional new pressure is going to lead to more dficulties in terms of access to accident and emergencies, dficulties with getting ambulances to people. All of those things will be considered as well.\"These are dficult judgements. Weve always tried to follow the science, but this is going to be a finely balanced judgement.\"It may be that well be keeping some restrictions, but there are no decisions that have been made so far.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityRising energy, goods and food prices helped push inflation to increase .% in the  months to February, Office for National Statisticsfigures revealed on Wednesday morning, hours before Mr Sunak’s speech to the Commons.He has pledged to “stand by” families to help them weather the crisis, with it being widely expected that he will cut fuel duty for motorists while Mr Sunak also considers increasing the threshold to begin paying national insurance .But Labour, branding him the “high-tax Chancellor”, has joined some Tory MPs in urging Mr Sunak to scrap the . percentage point hike to NI, which will hit next month just as energy bills soar when the price cap increases.The struggle facing households was further laid bare by the ONS figures showing an even higher than expected rise to the Consumer Prices Indexfigure for measuring inflation, as it hit the highest level since March , when it stood at .%.Fuel prices also hit new record highs, with figures from data firm Experian Catalist suggesting the average cost of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts on Tuesday was £., with diesel at £..Iceland’s managing director Richard Walker said the pressure of trying to keep supermarket prices down is “relentless” as he called for action on energy prices.“It’s incredibly concerning. We’re hearing of some food bank users declining potatoes and root veg because they can’t afford the energy to boil them,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.Mr Sunak is expected to link strengthening the UK economy to opposing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, but he is under pressure to address the domestic crisis.“So when I talk about security, yes, I mean responding to the war in Ukraine,” he is poised to tell the House of Commons..remove“But I also mean the security of a faster-growing economy, the security of more resilient public finances, and security for working families as we help with the cost of living.”The Financial Times reported on Tuesday evening that forecasts in the statement will show the deficit is better than expected this year, to the tune of £ billion.However, the newspaper said Mr Sunak is planning to set aside a large part of this windfall cash – rather than investing the full sum in driving down the cost of living.Energy bills are soaring, inflation is at its highest in decades. Yet the Tories are choosing to raise taxes on working people.Tomorrow the Chancellor must halt the National Insurance hike and back our windfall tax to cut the cost of gas and electricity. https:t.co XKAYmajGNJ— James MurrayMarch , Labour’s shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: “As he heads into his spring statement, he can either choose an unfair tax rise on working people and business at the worst possible time, or he can cancel his tax rise and ease the cost of living hitting families by cutting energy bills by up to £ through bringing in a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits.” vw,vw,px, px\"People struggling to pay their energy bills will be hoping for new support from Mr Sunak The rocketing energy bills faced by households have been caused in part by a post-pandemic rise in demand for gas, with lower levels of production. This was only exacerbated by the war in Ukraine.A planned hike in NI contributions, combined with forecasts that wages will rise slower than inflation, will also take a toll.Delivering greater economic security for our people, accelerating growth and productivity, and making sure the proceeds of that growth are shared fairly.That is not the work of any one statement. But that work begins tomorrow.The Spring Statement starts at .. pic ZbflaC— Rishi SunakMarch , A briefing from the House of Commons library said the cost of living across the UK has been rising since early , while in January this year inflation reached its highest recorded level since .The Chancellor has already announced a £ loan for gas and electricity payments from October – although not until the price cap jumps %.In addition, certain households will get a £ council tax rebate in April.The Treasury said the measures announced so far add up to around £ billion of support this year, taking in the rebate, changes to Universal Credit and the freezing of fuel and alcohol duties.Mr Sunak is also expected to set out how the Government plans to create a new culture of enterprise, helping the private sector to train, invest, and innovate more.Other options available to the Chancellor include adjustments to VAT in certain sectors and an uprating of benefits in line with new inflation forecasts..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Inflation soaring to -year high pressures Sunak to help with spring statement article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Exhibitors will include Flood Marine, McAlinden Boats, Swim Ireland, Royal Yacht Association to name but a few, and it will be packed full of activities from fun and interactive workshops, to on the water demonstrations and experiences.“We’ve hosted successful events for over  years now, including the Ireland Angling Show in Dublin, so we honestly believe that the increasing passion and interest in marine leisure over recent years calls for a bigger and better show.“For those interested in perfecting their techniques or learning about new products, the show will feature talks from a range of experts in all areas of the marine leisure sector, while also giving guests the opportunity to chat to professionals and visit our exhibitor stands.“We are also delighted to have the support of Lisburn Castlereagh City Council who recognise the enormous potential of Northern Ireland in providing these kinds of homegrown holiday activities.“This is a very lucrative market for everyone in the wider tourism industry and from this exhibition alone we estimate that around £, will go into the local economy. Northern Ireland has so much to offer with quality accommodation and catering, superb activity facilities and of course unparalleled access to water be it lakes, rivers or coast, said Hugh.”Officiating at the event launch and welcoming it to the city, Alderman Amanda Grehan, Chair of Lisburn  Castlereagh City Council’s Development Committee, said that this is exactly the kind of event to show off the versatility of their tourism offering.“Eikon Exhibition Centre which is conveniently located beside the main arterial routes to Belfast and Dublin is now a signicant centre for International events being held in Ireland and the United Kingdom. It will draw in thousands of visitors and millions of pounds in consumer spend and sectoral investment.“Supporting events like this is a core part of our economic strategy for the council area demonstrating that we are also a critical economic generator benefiting the whole of Northern Ireland.“The countdown has now started, and I look forward to visiting Ireland on the Water Expo next year. It will be a true partnership across the marine, tourism, accommodation and hospitality sectors,” said Alderman Grehan.Details on further activities will be announced over the coming months and you can check out our website www.irelandonthewaterexpo.ie or follow us on social media @IrelandonthewaterexpoIf you would like to know more about the Expo please contact us here, email [email#protected] or telephone Grace Mc Dermot, Mara Media Sales Manager, on +  .Northern Ireland  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularSun shines for Charles and Camillas visit to Cookstown...NewsNI strike: Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon issues list of se...NewsAltercation at Lodge Road roundabout...NewsVehicle stolen from driveway of Dungannon house...NewsLurgan woman Amanda Verlaque’s new play in Belfast’s Lyric T...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Tracy then contacted her friend BrianMcCormick to askhe could make the chair for hershe could source a mannequin. “Mivan Marine Ltd kindly allowed Barney to work on the project and produce the chair on their premises.“Initially, a few high street stores and independents were approached to seethey would display Flossy, but they either weren’t interested or said they didn’t have room.”Dara pictured with Flossy and staff at Ballantine Fashions.It wasn’t until Amanda posted on the Facebook page, NI Business, that the campaign fully took off, with offers from several businesses to host Flossy. “The comments and feedback were all extremely positive,” Amanda added. “We are all delighted that Flossy has started her journey in Larne, as this is the home town of the Mae Murray Foundation that Dara attends.“The Foundation is a local charity with a vision of a society with true participation for all in leisure and social settings, regardless of age or ability. It provides opportunities for young people of all abilities to take part in ious activities and fun events that are accessible across Northern Ireland.”Meanwhile, Flossy has already attracted the notice of shoppers in Larne town centre, according to Gordon Kennedy of Ballantine Fashions. “We’ve had plenty of feedback from people who have noticed her,” he said. “We have always been an accessible shop and we were more than happy to take the opportunity to have her in our window.”Flossy is also scheduled to appear later in the year at Divinity Bridal, Lisburn, along with Midtown Makers in Ballymena.“Ulster Museum in Belfast has also expressed an interest in including her,” Amanda added.Read More Read MoreMajor changes to UK Covid travel rules come into effectLarne  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularSun shines for Charles and Camillas visit to Cookstown...NewsNI strike: Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon issues list of se...NewsAltercation at Lodge Road roundabout...NewsVehicle stolen from driveway of Dungannon house...NewsLurgan woman Amanda Verlaque’s new play in Belfast’s Lyric T...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The comments were made as the UFU launched its annual schools’ competition. Open to all playgroups, nursery, primary, and special schools, this year’s theme relates to the UFU’s food and farming education resource “Dig in!”, which encourages pupils to learn more about food, farming, and the countryside. UFU deputy president, David Brown said, “This year’s schools competition theme ‘Dig in! to food, farming and the environment’ provides an opportunity for teachers to start the discussion in the classroom about the importance of food and farming in NI, allowing pupils to learn more about how farmers work hard to produce the delicious, high-quality produce on our tables, and their contribution to shaping our landscape in NI, which everyone enjoys. “Climate change has been the front runner in NI this year and our farmers play an essential role in combating the global issue, as they are a key part of the solution. The schools competition helps pupils to enhance their understanding of how farmers create dferent environments in NI which support our economy, rural communities, tourism and recreation.” Mr Brown says every year the competition judges are impressed by the number, standard and creativity of entries for the schools’ competition. “We would encourage all nursery, playgroups, primary and special schools to participate in what is a very worthwhile competition. It’s a great opportunity to express their creativity while learning about one of the most important sectors in NI as they will discover the importance of local food production,” he said. The UFU is pleased to have competition sponsor Asda on board for another year with a range of prizes available for the lucky winners. Joe McDonald, Asda NI corporate affairs manager said, “Asda is a proud sponsor of the school’s competition. It is great to see competition entries grow year upon year, especially with the introduction of a dferentiating foundation category last year - the standard is superb. It is vital to create an awareness of where our produce comes from, and this competition is a great opportunity to do so - educating children on the ‘farm to fork’ story.” Now in its eleventh year, BOIOFW is the perfect partner for the schools’ competition. As part of the prize, the winner of each category receives free transport for their class to the nearest participating BOIOFW farm, and all competition entries will be on display throughout the weekend. Mr Brown says schools don’t need to be competition winners in order to visit real, working farms. “This free event showcases NI’s world-class ‘farm to fork’ journey and reconnects consumers with our farmers, the primary food producers.The weekend underlines the importance of supporting local producers to benefit the rural community and wider economy in NI. BOIOFW is taking place on Saturday  and Sunday  June, and I would certainly encourage all schools to consider organising a trip to a local participating farm on the schools’ day, Friday  June,” said the UFU deputy president. Entry forms have been sent electronically to all playgroups, nursery, primary and special schools. Schools’ competition templates are available by visitingwww.ufuni.org.The closing date for entries is Friday  April .

With over , responses to the consultation, both Ministers received an update from consultants ARUP on the initial findings from this phase of the Review at a progress meeting today.  Minister Nichola Mallon said: “Minister Ryan and I have a shared ambition for rail and are committed to improving our network for citizens across the island through our All Island Strategic Rail Review. The public consultation phase was a vital step in delivering this important piece of work and I am delighted to have delivered this key stage. Today we met with the consultants at ARUP, along with Minister Ryan to hear the out-workings of the consultation, to understand the views of the public and stakeholders and to ensure that their priorities are a focal point of the Review as it moves forward. “With over , responses received, this highlights that this work is long overdue and has captured the imagination of the public across the whole island. In that regard, the consultation has clearly demonstrated that our citizens view decarbonisation and enhancing connectivity as key components of this Review and these factors will play a strong role as we move forward to the next stage. “Minister Ryan and I have ensured now that working in partnership the next steps will move at pace. The next phase now will see ARUP analyse the comments and feedback received to ensure that the final report fully considers the views of our citizens when published by the end of the year. “This is an exciting opportunity for people, communities and our island economy.

I’m proud that in government, Minister Ryan and I have shown that working together in the interests of people works and I hope we can continue working closely to see delivery on our aspirations for all island rail.” Minister Ryan said:“I’m delighted with the progress of the All-Island Strategic Rail Review. The incredible public response has shown the importance of rail for regional accessibility and demonstrated wide support for sustainable public transport. The public and stakeholders’ ambitions for the future of passenger and freight rail transport will play a signicant role in the future work of the Review, informing concepts to enhance the rail network and, in doing so, enhance connectivity, drive decarbonisation and support sustainable social and economic development. “Minister Mallon and I are committed to increasing low-carbon mobility and regional accessibility. Through rail we can sustainably enhance connectivity to improve the quality of le for all citizens on the island of Ireland.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_efdebfabecafcbd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_deeebceabf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1648027003458.jpg--ministers_welcome_report_aimed_at_producing_a_21st_century_high_street.jpg?164802700600","title":"ministers welcome report aimed at producing a st century high street ","story":"Junior Ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney have welcomed the publication of the Executive’s High Street Task Force report ‘Delivering a st Century High Street’, along with its  recommendations. The Junior Ministers, who are joint chairs of the task force, were presented with the report today by High Street Task Force members Glyn Roberts, Retail NI Seamus McAleavey, NICVA and Cathy Reynolds, SOLACE and paid tribute to the work carried out and the collaboration involved from both inside and outside of government. Junior Minister Gary Middleton said: “Our high streets have experienced constant and increasing change, particularly in recent years. “We want to empower people and communities to reshape and repurpose their local villages, towns and cities, to create a more erse high street - high streets that are clean, green, family friendly destinations that are welcoming for everyone. “I want to thank the High Street Task Force for bringing forward this report which has been developed to prioritise those actions that can drive delivery and build momentum. “A joined-up and collaborative approach must continue over the coming years to deliver high streets, village, town and city centres that are fit for the st century and this report provides the next steps for the new Ministers in the next mandate to take forward work to revitalise our village, town and city centres.” Junior Minister Declan Kearney said: “We want to see our cities, towns and villages regain and retain their vibrancy, purpose and sense of place. High streets of the future should be safe and attractive gathering points for whole communities, where people can live, work, shop, learn, do business, use public services and enjoy their leisure time. “The High Street Task Force report provides a long-term focus on addressing the transformation of our high streets and recognises that there will be a requirement for a number of short, medium and longer-term interventions. “I want to thank Task Force for their hard work and commitment to date and commend the joint-working and co-design roles played by departments, retail and other business organisations, trade unions, local councils and the community and voluntary sectors. “I believe this report and its recommendations can play a vital role in revitalising our high streets.” Glyn Roberts, Retail NI Chief Executive and Chair of the High Street Task Force – Influencing Policy and Strategy sub-group, said: “This report sets out proposals for a five year reconstruction plan for our high streets, reform of our business rates and the need to improve our retail planning policy. “We hope that an incoming Executive after the election will hit the ground running with this plan and begin the long road of recovery for our high streets.” Seamus McAleavey, Chief Executive of NICVA and member of the High Street Task Force – Developing Capacity sub-group, said: “It is obvious change is happening. We are in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it has speeded up during the Covid pandemic by necessity. Online commerce is the norm and communities need to re-invent there town centres. “Only a new vision will work as the past is the past. Communities are the heart of the city, town and villages centres. We can build vibrant high streets places people want to work in, shop in and enjoy themselves in. It is achievable.” Cathy Reynolds, Director of City Regeneration and Development, Place and Economy Department, Belfast City Council, and representing SOLACE , said: “Our high streets have experienced signicant change and challenges over recent years and it is critical that there is a focused effort to address these challenges and build on opportunities to ensure the future sustainability of our towns and cities. “A long term sustained approach is required to ensure high streets are supported to thrive and most importantly survive.” The High Street Task Force report and its recommendations will be subject to consideration by the next Executive who will determine how it can be aligned with the future Programme for Government.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_efdebfabecafcbd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_deeebceabf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
