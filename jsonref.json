Eastern Australian humpbacks migrate north from Antarctica, along the coast to tropical waters in north Queensland from April to July.The whales give birth in the warmer waters and often mothers and calves are spotted heading south during the latter part of the Australian spring.One boardrider, Josh, told  Australia he had never seen a whale, particularly a calf, come so close to the beach at Manly.“There was a bit of pointing going on and I looked round and the little one was just there,” Josh said.“Then mum came in pretty quick smart, I think when she realised how close people were.Images show dozens of surfers watching from about 10m from the mother humpback and calf.Initially there was some concern that one of the whales had been caught in a shark net, but surfers said that was not the case.“I think everyone was just paddling up to get a good look. It’s the sort of thing you won’t forget seeing.”Last week researchers from the University of NSW found that while whale watching season in Australia is often a tourism drawcard, many humpbacks were not in optimum health during the return leg of the migration.The researchers collected and analysed samples of whale blow – similar to mucus from a human nose – and found “significantly less” microbial ersity and richness on journey south.Their paper, published in the journal Scientific Reports, said this indicated the whales were likely in poorer health than when their journey began.“People enjoy whale-watching season, but with it comes reports of whales becoming stranded,” said the study’s lead author, science researcher Catharina Vendl.“Although humpback whale stranding events occur naturally and regularly to injured and young whales, it is crucial to monitor the population health of this iconic species to ensure its long-term survival.“Humpback whales do not only play an essential role in their marine ecosystem but also represent an important economic resource because whale-watching is a booming industry in many Australian cities and around the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26f56af606ca2f856dd17d2648f69c53a0d63ebd/0_210_4815_2889/master/4815.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f05fa22f85f2cd5d6bdb06ee9fddbdfb","title":"victoria premier daniel andrews stage four coronavirus lockdown restrictions melbourne covid 19","story":"Premier Daniel Andrews has announced tougher rules, including a limit of travelling 5km for shopping and exercise, in an attempt to contain rising community transmissionMelbourne residents will be subject to an overnight curfew for the next six weeks, and be banned from travelling more than 5km to go shopping or to exercise, as Victoria attempts to get the number of new coronavirus cases under control.The premier, Daniel Andrews, announced that from 6pm on Sunday, residents in the Melbourne metropolitan area would be under curfew for six weeks until 13 September.Andrews also declared a state of disaster in Victoria for the first time since the bushfires earlier this year.Under the new restrictions, people would only be able to leave their home once a day for essential supplies and food, and once for one hour of exercise, within a 5km radius.“We can no longer have people simply out and about for no good reason whatsoever. It is not an easy decision to make but it is necessary and that’s why I’ve made it and that’s why police will be out in force and you will be stopped and you will be asked and need to demonstrate that you are lawfully out and you are not breaching that curfew,” Andrews said on Sunday.Between 8pm and 5am, people living in Melbourne will not be able to leave home except for work, medical care and caregiving.People will still be able to visit their partners – including if it is further than 5km from home.There is also an exception to the 5km rule if the nearest supermarket is further than 5km from home.Golf and tennis venues, which were allowed to stay open in stage 3, will be closed again and people will no longer be allowed to exercise in groups larger than two, even for those living in the same household.Regional Victoria will move to stage 3 restrictions from midnight on Wednesday.Food and grocery stores will stay open, amid reports of people queuing up outside Coles and Woolworths outlets across the state.On Sunday, Woolworths announced restrictions in Victoria on buying more than two of certain essential items, including dairy, meat, vegetables, fish and toilet paper.Andrews said there was no need for people to be panic buying again.Victoria reported 671 new cases of coronavirus on Sunday and seven more deaths. Andrews said that a new strategy was required to suppress cases because on the current trajectory it would be the end of the year before Victoria would be in a position to open up again.The six weeks could be shortened if the numbers do start to come down, but Andrews would not say whether it would be back to stage 3 or less onerous restrictions.“If everyone plays their part there is some prospect we can achieve our outcome before then. I’m not making any commitments on that and not suggesting if we got to a certain threshold we’d be able to go back to these restrictions prior to me standing up today or another level,” he said.“Ultimately we’ll have to be, just as we always have been, guided by the data, the evidence, the numbers and the detailed analysis of those numbers.”Community transmission is still too high under the current restrictions, Andrews said, with the state now having 760 so-called “mystery cases” of coronavirus.Under the curfew, public transport services will be scaled back between 8pm and 5am, and public transport officers erted to ensure people are complying.The state of disaster declaration will empower the police minister, Lisa Neville, to appoint police as authorised officers. This means when doing spot checks on people’s homes, if the residents did not give permission for them to enter, police will be authorised to enter without a warrant.The fines for breaching health orders remains at $1,652, but Andrews flagged he would have more to say about penalties on Monday.The premier said he would also reveal more about what specific industries would be closed.“They are not easy decisions to make,” he said.“That’s why we are taking a bit more time to make sure we have full visibility and understanding of what the impacts of those decisions would be, not just on workers and the business, but on those who rely on the goods.”Andrews said decisions on closures could have supply chain implications well beyond Victoria – noting the state had the biggest container port in the country.“We are a hub for so many things. Anything that’s shut down here can have knock-on effects and consequences well beyond our state.”Remote learning will return for all Victoria school students, including years 11 and 12, from Wednesday, except for vulnerable children and children of permitted workers. Childcare and kindergarten will be closed from Thursday.Ubers and taxis will still be able to operate, but masks are mandatory and passengers will need to sit in the back seat.Weddings will no longer be allowed from Thursday, and funerals will be limited to 10 people.The federal education minister, Dan Tehan, signalled on Sunday that the federal government would be supportive of additional measures aimed at reducing community transmission in Victoria.“There’s no question that these are very difficult times in Victoria at the moment and I think that everybody wants to see us get on top of this second wave – it’s absolutely vital for the nation that we do this,” he told Sky News.“We need to make sure that we can get on top of this virus in Victoria.”Tehan said the two levels of government would work together, with the commonwealth doing what it could to support Victoria’s efforts.He said the federal government had acknowledged there were things in aged care – a commonwealth responsibility – that “could have been done better” but said the most important thing needed to protect the sector was to bring community transmission under control.Tehan said the commonwealth would work with Victoria to ensure the public health response – including adequate contract tracing – was adequate.The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the developments in Victoria should prompt a rethink of the Coalition’s plan to reduce the rate of the jobkeeper wage subsidy from September. The changes were “based on some pretty rosy assumptions on Victorian restrictions easing rather than becoming tighter”, he said.“Clearly, jobkeeper shouldn’t be provided forever, but it shouldn’t be withdrawn too quickly,” Chalmers told the ABC.“We think that the developments since the announcements on jobkeeper a couple of weeks ago do warrant another look at the arrangements the government has announced.”The state’s number of confirmed infections rose by 397 on Saturday, and although this was far fewer than Thursday’s peak of 723, Andrews was not encouraged.The state government’s cabinet crisis committee is believed to have held a teleconference overnight.Victoria’s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said discussions were being held about the prospect of further restrictions like New Zealand has had, requiring the shutdown of all non-essential services.The premier has been frustrated by people disobeying public health orders, including positive cases who weren’t home when defence force members came knocking.One person was fined on Saturday for leaving Melbourne to drive to Wodonga for a hamburger while another tried to drive from Werribee to Springvale – on opposite sides of Melbourne – for groceries.Andrews said the time for warnings had passed and a “much bigger fine” through the courts was being considered as an alternative to on-the-spot fines.Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dd4b61e06e8265c8bc537eb13255b9909fea8ad/0_255_2600_1559/master/2600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32938b59302e40eb70781a245a762c4c","title":"antkind by charlie kaufman review absurdism ad infinitum","story":"The idiosyncratic screenwriter’s bloated debut novel – about an idiosyncratic screenwriter – is a slogAntkind is the debut novel of Charlie Kaufman, the Being John Malkovich and Synecdoche, New York film-maker, and its premise is incredibly, well, Kaufmanesque. A film critic named B Rosenberg discovers an unseen stop-motion movie – a three month-long work of astonishing brilliance – and is sure it will change his life, the art of cinema, possibly the entire world. But it burns in a truck fire before he can save it. After waking from three months in a medically induced coma, B turns to hypnotism to reconstruct the film from memory.From the start, the storytelling is unstable: details change, B’s exhaustive film nerdery is riddled with malapropian errors, fiction and reality blur. Antkind eventually embraces all-out chaos: by the end, the world is on fire, flying Trump robots are at war with a fast-food corporation, hospitals are staffed by clowns, ants time travel…I could go on. On and on and on. Kaufman certainly does: Antkind is 706 pages long. It offers a maximalist satire of a contemporary America defined by fake news, corporate bullshit, vacuous pop culture and performative wokeness, but one so excessive, surreal and repetitive that it is itself tiresomely bloated and absolutely exhausting. If anything can happen without consequence, stakes are lowered. It’s absurdism ad infinitum.Where Kaufman’s films are playfully mind-bending, they usually have real heart. But although Antkind is skippingly clever – saturated with comic allusions, puns, linguistic inventiveness and wildly unfettered imagination – it is sorely lacking characters you actually care about or any emotional narrative to cling to.B is a bitter, humourless, arrogant, middle-aged, white man, who believes himself to be extremely culturally sensitive he makes a point of stating that his girlfriend is African American and using the gender-neutral pronoun “thon”. In fact, B is relentlessly revealed to be a self-pitying, sleazy racist. Of course, Kaufman invites us to see through B’s self-delusion and hypocrisy - he doesn’t defend B. But when you demand readers spend that much time with someone, you are still, to use a phrase Antkind would sneer at, privileging that white-male-cis-het perspective above all others. There is something deeply wearying about Kaufman mocking woke culture while delivering 700 pages of tedious, white-dude inner life.Besides, Kaufman’s own tone is one of tittering provocation: sending up tokenistic trans characters, queasily naming B’s daughter – a feminist who publicly renounces her father – Grace Farrow. These are Kaufman’s choices, not his character’s.He does use B’s insecure voice to snipe at real-life film-makers and critics, however, from Christopher Nolan to Mark Kermode, which lends Antkind a certain gossipy frisson (who is really doing the trash-talking: B or Kaufman?). Plus it allows him to get extra-meta: whenever B is rude about the films of Charlie Kaufman, the author enacts a slapstick revenge on his own creation, sending B tumbling down manholes.Antkind feels like a book that’s been indulged rather than edited there’s a smaller, smarter novel somewhere in here, currently smothered in smug junk. One compelling section sees B meet his more successful doppelganger and tussle over their wildly different reconstructions of the film, throwing up enjoyably thorny questions about memory and interpretation, the purposes of comedy and what kind of talent and stories we value. But then Kaufman hurtles into the next surreal non sequitur, and the next, for another several hundred pages.

She worked as an assistant producer at BBC Comedy and was shortlisted by the 4th Estate B4ME prize for her debut story, Netflix and Chill. Her first short story collection, Love in Colour, retellings of mythical tales from around the world, is out this month and comes heaped with praise from authors including Meg Cabot and Candice Carty-Williams.Romcoms are a big part of your life and the inspiration for your book. Why?I feel like love and romance are seen as innately feminine and therefore inherently inferior, which is a terrible misogynistic take. We need art to have hope, especially when the world is so full of bleakness, and romcoms do that. My stories will have happy endings, but that’s also a perspective that can help shift the way you see things in real life. People think of love as a fluffy emotion, but it’s not – it’s steely and powerful and it can bring out courage in us. It’s only dismissed, I think, by people who don’t understand love and why it should be celebrated.How did your book come about? You’ve talked before about manifesting your dreams into existence…I’ve always wanted to be a writer and be around writers. I’ve been writing short stories since I was in school - they got passed round by my classmates on a weekly basis. I was working on my first novel when the idea for this collection came about. It happened almost accidentally.How did you get your break in the industry?Well, with the BBC, I applied for an internship in production and didn’t get it, but they said: “Keep in touch.” So I did. I was temping at production companies and emailed the BBC every month until eventually they got back to me. That’s how I got in. My department was lovely, but there isn’t much room to move up in the TV industry. That isn’t specific to the BBC – ersity is a problem across the landscape – but I felt I needed to leave to write my own opportunities. Plus, I was doing a part-time master’s at UCL and wanted to focus on my thesis, which was about Beyoncé’s Lemonade.Which tale in the book speaks the most to modern romance?Orin, a new tale I wrote, based loosely on bad dates I’ve had.Are you in love right now or dating?I’m Nigerian, no comment.Your parents’ love story makes it into the book and seems to be a cornerstone for you, but what do you find the most challenging aspects of modern love and dating?Social media. People can be driven crazy by somebody who hasn’t replied to a text but watches their Insta story. It amplifies insecurity… I don’t think that level of exposure is conducive to getting to know someone. I don’t do dating apps, because I don’t like the performance of them, though I have friends who got married through them.What’s next for you?Last month, out of nowhere, I was asked to interview Michaela Coel for the cover of Paper magazine. I’ve also been in the writers’ room back at the BBC, for shows coming out next year. And then there will be my debut novel.Finally, you’ve said you’re not a fan of being “nice”. Why is that?Because nice and good are not the same thing. Nice says nothing about morals or integrity or beliefs, it’s just a knowledge of how to appear affable. It’s dependent on whoever is calling you nice, it doesn’t stand on its own. I’m a dark-skinned black woman living in the western world. There’s a lot of stuff that could really affect me, but nice isn’t something I should work for. Being good and kind, that means something. • Love in Colour is published by Headline on 20 August (£16.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

However, the protocol means that many EU regulations will remain in place in Northern Ireland after 1 January, regardless of the outcome of trade negotiations between the UK and the EU. Those regulations include those limiting CO2 emissions from cars.All major carmakers who sell cars in the EU must reduce their average carbon emissions to below 95g per kilometre over the course of 2020 and 2021, and the UK has pledged rules that are at least as stringent. Carmakers who do not meet inidual targets face fines worth potentially hundreds of millions of euros, with equivalent penalties in sterling in the UK.A government consultation published this month revealed that Northern Ireland will count as a member of the EU for the purposes of working out average emissions, to avoid the possibility of a car being double-counted.The consultation paper said: “Newly registered vehicles in Northern Ireland from 1 January 2021 will continue to be the subject of the EU regulation. The retained version of the regulation, and the subject of this consultation, will apply in Great Britain only.”The effect of the new regulations on businesses and consumers is highly uncertain, given potential variation in consumer demand for different models and inidual carmakers’ different circumstances, but the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the UK car lobby group, has previously warned that carmakers may pull larger cars from UK sale to avoid fines.The Department for Transport declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4f337f39fb7f75f5dee08c88af40b0ae7d6a5d3/0_432_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c8219f7eb8c9279a2a22d72fe6603a8","title":"sun sand sea staycation skegness","story":"With Spain out of bounds again, hopes are rising for a new lease of life in England’s careworn seaside resorts – and nowhere more so than in the birthplace of Butlin’sEarly on Friday morning, with the sun already promising the hottest day of the year, an age-old British ritual was taking place in the car park beside the pier in Skegness. “Stand there, son,” the dad in the car next to mine was saying to his boy as they unpacked beach chairs and slapped on sunscreen. “Close your eyes, and breathe that in!” And his son, six years old, dutifully took in his summer’s first lungful of British seaside – his smile widening as that mix of sea salt, fish and chips, candyfloss and generator diesel hit him, the skirl of seagulls and Wurlitzers in the air. Who could resist?Friday was one of those mornings when, from the pier – with the new morning’s golden sand stretching away in both directions and the first arrivals bashing in the poles of wind breaks – you could see Skegness as 30-year-old Billy Butlin must have seen it when he took the train to the sleepy Victorian resort in 1927. Butlin, who had a travelling fair, took one look at Skegness and decided he had finally found his promised land.Well before he built his first holiday camp a mile up the coast, Butlin, from his home in a caravan in a field of cows near the seafront clock tower, brought to Skegness not only Europe’s first dodgems but wall-of-death motorcyclists, a flea circus, high ers and a zoo. Skegness was sold as a place where anything might be possible.In nearly a century since, that can-do vision had hardened into something more dispiriting. Last month, in a survey by Which?, Skegness came out bottom of 100 British coastal destinations for customer satisfaction, receiving a one-star rating, the lowest possible, for its attractions, scenery, peace and quiet and value for money.There are 28,000 caravans that line the coast from here up to South Somercotes. Bookings are in heavy demand.“For a long time,” Yates suggests, “such domestic holidays have been the preserve of an older age group. What we are seeing from our feedback is a different sort of customer coming. Families with young children, who might have gone abroad for years. The hope is that what has been forced on people this year could become a lasting habit.”Down on the beach – where flesh is already reddening by 11 in the morning, and there is plenty of space to accommodate social distancing – I talk to one or two families who have changed their plans in this way. Richard Leigh, 42, from Northampton, last came to this coast as a child. He and his wife, Ann, and their two young children were due to be in Spain this summer, but are glad they have struck lucky with some Costa del Sol weather in Lincolnshire. “If you could guarantee it was going to be like this every day, it would be a no-brainer, wouldn’t it?”The stallholders of Skegness know that wisdom only too well. Darryl Woods has had the concession for children’s rides and a bouncy slide up on the pier for eight years. The sunshine is welcome, he says, but it’s going to take much more fine weather to recover what has been lost in the past months of shutdown. “And it’s not as if last year was great either.”At the other end of the promenade, past the stalls selling edible pebbles and Skegness rock and marshmallow willies, past the morning queues at the vodka slushy bars, next to the statue of the town’s Jolly Fisherman mascot, John Stead is setting up his sunglasses pitch. He fondly recalls the days when the Radio One roadshow used to pack the beach.At least the sun is shining, I suggest.“Nah, it’s too hot,” he says. “Everyone’s on the beach, rather than up here.”“Overcast,” says the sunglasses seller, “with a chance of drizzle.”Butlin’s itself, just along the coast, was originally imagined to cater for just that eventuality.“I think we’ve actually opened at just the right time because things are starting to loosen off with regards to live entertainment,” he says. “So from next week, we’re probably the only place in the country that will be able to offer a pantomime.” There is a new outdoor stage for Diversity, the Britain’s Got Talent winners.The huge challenge, he feels, remains to sell this stretch of coast as an out-of-season destination. Other traditional coastal resorts, particularly those in closer proximity to the capital, navigated that shift better than Skegness. Whitstable has become a foodie destination, with its microbreweries and oyster festival. With the help of Tracey Emin, Margate managed to make ramshackle retro. Here, the money that flooded into the town from the holiday fortnights of the east Midlands, ended with the closure of the mines in the 1980s and has never properly been replaced.Former Skegness mayor Sid Dennis, 69, fervently believes that reinvention is happening. Dennis is chairman of the town’s latest funding committee, with plans for a £30m redevelopment, that hopes to tap into the government’s promises to regenerate coastal towns.The Dennis family has been in the recycling – scrap metal – business here since 1888. His grandfather owned one of the first caravan sites on the coast here. As well as his day job at the scrapyard, Dennis has been a standup comedian for 30 years, with a previous residency at Skegness Butlins.Dennis’s bread and butter is waste collection for the resorts. During the pandemic, he says, his regular collection of 4,000 industrial bins went down to 200 overnight.“We are used to factoring in bad weather, floods, snow, but you can’t factor in waking up to fuck all,” he says. “For a week, not a cheque dropped on the mat. I said to my wife – who is also my PA – stop everything going out, all the direct debits. We’ve been married 46 years and when she’s anxious, she calls me husband. ‘Husband, whatever is going to happen?’ she said.” Don’t worry, Dennis replied, they will be in touch.Dennis believes that the crisis, and the renewed interest in staycations, has presented an opportunity as well as a challenge, but only if the town can seize it. “Billy Butlin was always an innovator,” he says, “and there is a lot of vision in the town still.”With some zeal, he talks me through the out-of-season possibilities of the “wild coast” harking back to the health benefits of the big skies and sea air.“People think Skegness is a bit working class,” Dennis says, “and it is. People work hard and they want to come and enjoy themselves. I’ve got a bit of money but I still love walking along the seafront having fish and chips out of the bag. That’s our street food. But there needs to be an extra offer.”What success Skegness has had in changing its traditional image has centred around the annual SO arts festival, which – until plans were scuppered this year – brought a broader demographic to the town. “Publicans always tell me they always know when SO is on,” he says, with a laugh. “Because suddenly they have people ordering starter, main, pudding, bottle of wine. Which makes a change from the early bird special between five of them.”The fund committee’s aim is to build on that possibility, with a redevelopment of the seafront that will include a new permanent indoor arts pavilion and cinema (as well as a dramatic observation tower). He gestures to the weather outside: “We can’t rely on this.”He admits that not everything in the Which? survey was wide of the mark. Dennis has a holiday flat in Crete. He would love above all to import a Greek sense of hospitality to Lincolnshire.“If you order a cup of coffee, the Greek waiter carefully turns the cup in its saucer to you, just so,” he says, “and gives you a little biscuit. Here they whack a mug down in front of you while they are talking to a mate on their mobile phone.”His committee plans an FE college that offers a degree or a diploma in hospitality. “Training brings pride. And if you can get back that pride, you can get that Greek cafe culture here,” he insists. “Get a farmer’s market going, an antiques festival, a steampunk festival. I still think,” he says, with the kind of Billy Butlin enthusiasm that comes from closing your eyes and taking a deep gulp of seaside air, “despite everything, this town can offer whatever people like.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74de7eeae45fbe3278b4215caab48f88f85f00c7/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=3368528aa374a3ee4b7b3450f6f92a18","title":"decline high street amazon power tech giant","story":"Politicians talk about saving traditional shops, yet they should focus efforts on challenging the vast power of the tech giant What will happen to the high street now? After long years of decline prior to the pandemic, the sense of inevitable disaster is becoming overwhelming. Pick your place, and the headlines will tell you most of the story: “Further blow for East Kilbride as Marks \u0026amp Spencer confirm closure of flagship store,” reports the Scottish Daily Record, adding that the news came “just days after Zara announced it would leave … with Boots stores in the town under threat and a number of restaurants having closed”.Last week, when he made his first ever appearance before a committee of the US Congress – alongside Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Apple’s Tim Cook, and the Google chief, Sundar Pichai – the impression was of a man secure in his position, occasionally unsettled by questions about his company’s power and alleged abuses of it, but calmly confident that the future was still his.As shown by its newly announced plans to break into the UK grocery delivery market, and the prospect of up to 30 of its checkout-free Go convenience stores in commuter hotspots, there seems no limit to Amazon’s ambitions for retailing. It is ceaselessly expanding, both as a direct vendor and the host of a vast marketplace for other sellers that often looks like a brutally effective means of ining what products are becoming popular and then ensuring the company sells them itself (a practice that Bezos told his congressional interrogators was against company policy, though he “can’t guarantee” it has never happened).Meanwhile, as if to suggest a corporation plucked from the pages of a Philip K Dick novel, the same giant firm that supplies millions of us with every consumer item under the sun – and that sits at the heart of many homes via its Echo devices – also delivers computing services to the CIA, Nasa, the US navy, and the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.Amazon’s sheer scale means that the effects of what it does transcend the fortunes of the company and amount to deep social transformations. For its retail customers, consumerism is no longer a matter of venturing outside the home but the lonely transcendence of ordering and then getting. Most of Amazon’s workers, meanwhile, are either shut behind windowless walls, doing the minute and monotonous tasks that punctuate the workings of machines, or frantically delivering parcels. Complaints about the company’s treatment of its employees are now a constant, but – like those about Amazon’s record on tax – they rarely gain real traction. Prior to delivery, the average Amazon package is thought to require just one minute of labour: soon enough, this will surely dwindle even further.But if all this denotes historic change, politics has yet to catch up. Thanks partly to the nostalgic mood defined by Brexit, in the UK too many people in charge still fixate on somehow reviving traditional shops. The government’s latest proposal is an online sales tax, which would make up for cuts to business rates, thereby supposedly allowing retail businesses to survive.In some places, such measures might have beneficial effects. The problem is that fixating on the traditional high street serves as a distraction from thinking about the workings of online business and Amazon specifically: how to challenge its vast power, monitor and regulate what happens to its workers, and manage the impact of the technology.Some of the most incisive answers have recently come from a former Amazon insider. In May, the Amazon tech engineer and vice-president Tim Bray left its Web Services ision. Incensed by the fact that colleagues who had protested about the treatment of warehouse workers during the pandemic had been dismissed, he began writing punchy blogposts focused on what ought to be done about big tech’s power.“Amazon is exceptionally well-managed and has demonstrated great skill at spotting opportunities and building repeatable processes for exploiting them,” he said. “It has a corresponding lack of vision about the human costs of the relentless growth and accumulation of wealth and power. If we don’t like certain things Amazon is doing, we need to put legal guardrails in place to stop those things … a combination of antitrust and living-wage and worker-empowerment legislation, rigorously enforced, offers a clear path forward.”In the US and at the heart of the European Union, some of this is at least being discussed. Yet leaving the EU is likely to boost efforts to turn the UK into a light-touch regulatory paradise for capitalists and to encourage our national tendency to see large corporations as an uncontrollable force of nature.“The only real constant in retail is customers’ desire for lower prices, better selection, and convenience,” Bezos told his questioners on Capitol Hill. Herein lies what is propelling us into the future, from Seattle to post-industrial Scotland: supply meeting demand. Meanwhile, politicians fail to address profound questions about corporate power, work and wealth, and a world changing beyond recognition."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe003ceadfb07502c7e3a28baafe3def64ec8c88/0_0_1476_886/master/1476.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=dbc6eb40e7bd8eb090881d2796b9a044","title":"why i spent my life saving the blakistons fish owl","story":"Jonathan Slaght has devoted decades to preserving the largest owl species in the world. Here he talks about his wilderness adventures in a remote corner of RussiaWhen I was 19, in the summer of 1995, I fell in love with an owl. I’d just spent two weeks in Primorye in the Russian far east – a wild, mountainous province bordering the Sea of Japan, China and North Korea. It is a region of dense forests, rolling mountains, clean rivers and spectacular coastlines. Exotic locations were nothing new for me: I was born in the United States but grew up in a diplomat’s family, bouncing around the world from Uruguay to Panama as a young child, and to West Germany and Canada as a teen. Before the age of 16, I’d only lived in the United States for two years.While I’d always been interested in the outdoors, I’d been ambivalent about birds and had never thought they would become my life’s passion. In fact, it was teenage envy that got me started. A high-school friend, now a professor of organismal biology at Gettysburg College, began a passionate study of birds and I wanted to keep up.When I left Russia after that summer in 1995, I brought home with me a Soviet-era book about the region’s birds. I immersed myself in the pages of this intoxicating world, turning from one remarkable species to the next, not knowing the English names of any of them, and struggling to decipher the Russian text with my pocket dictionary. The species that most drew my fascination was the Blakiston’s fish owl, the largest owl species in the world. With some iniduals exceeding 5kg, they weigh the equivalent of a dozen crows, and fly on 2m, eagle-sized wings. They are dishevelled masses of woodchip-brown plumage, electric yellow eyes and long and floppy ear tufts like the leaves of a fern. These owls live in some of the hardest-to-reach forests of northeast Asia, enduring temperatures that dip to -30C. They eat salmon plucked from rivers and nest in centuries-old trees.In addition to being absolute giants, Blakiston’s make us rethink what it means to be an owl. As a rule, owls are famous for their silent flight and hypersensitive hearing, both adaptations that fish owls lack – as their prey is underwater, a silent attack is unnecessary.Many owls have a distinctive facial disc – the characteristic round feather pattern on an owl’s face channels the faintest sounds to its ears. But in fish owls this disc is poorly defined. Instead they rely heavily on sight to hunt, crouching motionless on a riverbank, waiting for a ripple in the water to pounce on a passing fish.There were four photos of fish owls in my Soviet book, taken by Yury Pukinsky, the first scientist to find a fish owl nest in Russia, in 1971. Pukinsky had spent years studying birds along the Bikin River, in northern Primorye, a very remote place even today. One of his photos showed an adult fish owl hunched on a branch with the limp remains of a frog hanging from its beak. Another showed a fluffy grey nestling peering out defiantly from behind the carcass of an enormous salmon brought to the nest by a parent. The images were grainy, exciting and filled with mystery. I was smitten but, as with a celebrity crush, I knew I’d never meet one in real life.Five years later, and quite by chance, I did.I was back in Primorye, with the Peace Corps, living in Lazo, a small village surrounded by the Sikhote-Alin mountains some four hours east of Vlaostok. Remote as it was, I didn’t think this was nearly exotic enough for fish owls.It was one of those late winter days that flirted with spring. The sun felt warmer than it had in months, but the wind still carried the full force of winter’s cold. Perhaps it was the sound of the wind that distracted the owl, allowing me to get so close before it noticed me. I didn’t see it until it flew from a tree, enormous and panicked, taking to the air with laboured flaps. It hooted its displeasure, then landed for a moment in the bare canopy nearby. I grabbed my camera and took a few quick shots. The creature seemed almost too big and too comical to be a real bird, as if someone had hastily glued fistfuls of feathers to a small bear, then propped the dazed beast in the tree. Deciding that I was a threat, the creature pivoted to escape, crashing through the trees as its enormous wings, with feathers the length of my forearm, clipped the branches. Flakes of displaced bark spiralled down as the bird flew out of sight.In retrospect, it’s obvious I’d seen a fish owl but, in the moment, my brain refused to accept this truth. I’d convinced myself so thoroughly that I’d never see a fish owl that I simply refused to believe it. How could it be that this bird of mystery, found only in the remotest of forests, was on the edge of Lazo with its hoot blending among the sounds of passing trucks and baying village dogs?Thankfully, my few grainy photos, after calm and collected inspection, confirmed the sighting. And after I showed my photos to a Vlaostok-based ornithologist named Sergey Surmach, I learned that a fish owl hadn’t been seen so far south in the Sikhote-Alin mountains for 100 years.The more I talked to Surmach, and heard about fish owls and their habitat, the more concerned I became for the future of the species. There were thought to be fewer than 1,000 of them in Russia. Across the sea in Japan, just 300km east, fish owls had been reduced to fewer than 100 birds by the early 1980s, down from approximately 500 pairs at the end of the 19th century. They had lost nesting habitat to logging, and food to construction of downstream dams that blocked salmon migration up rivers.The fish owls of Primorye had been shielded from a similar fate by Soviet inertia, poor infrastructure and a low human population. But the free market that had emerged in the 1990s bred wealth, corruption and a covetous eye focused keenly on the untouched natural resources in northern Primorye, thought to be the bird’s global stronghold. While fish owls and other endangered species were protected by Russian law – it was illegal to kill them or destroy their habitat – by the late 1990s, previously inaccessible forests in Primorye were increasingly under threat. Fish owls needed a champion.Surmach and I agreed to collaborate on an ambitious project to study the fish owls of Primorye, to learn how to protect them. Our intentions were to do so while not ignoring the 2m people living in the province, many of whom rely on logging and fishing for their livelihoods. The needs of birds and humans are inextricably linked here – both have depended on the same resources for centuries. Before the Russians came to dip their nets in the rivers and harvest trees, Manchurian and indigenous populations did the same. The Udege and Nanai made embroidered clothing from salmon skins and carved boats from enormous, hollowed-out trees. Fish owl reliance on these resources has remained at modest levels it is human needs that have escalated.This work was not for the faint of heart, and I credit Surmach and another Sergey – Avedyuk – for sharing my vision of making the world safer for fish owls. In the first five years of this project, I spent three months a year in the Russian forests with Avedyuk and others, far from human settlements. Our work was mostly in winter, with up to five of us packed into a military-style truck with a wood stove to keep us from freezing overnight.We negotiated with hunters and hermits for food and shelter. We huddled in tents during blizzards. One morning, we woke to find the snowy tracks of an Amur tiger just a few paces from our camp. And at the end of the first field season, we nearly lost our truck while crossing a river during a flood. The work was often disheartening, uncomfortable, cold and lonely. But it was worth it. By the end, we’d collected the information we needed to craft a plan to protect fish owls, a strategy we are still following today.I’m 43 now and fish owls have been part of my entire adult life, but my duties for the Wildlife Conservation Society now include bird conservation issues across all of Asia. I’m based in Minneapolis, where I have a wife and two small children. In a typical year I will spend up to three months in Asia, from the tundra of the Russian Arctic to the mudflats of Myanmar. Leaving my family for long stretches is hard, no question, but I thrive on the work I do.Despite my global portfolio, fish owls and Primorye have a close hold on my heart. The forests are among the most exciting and beautiful places I’ve ever been. Along the Sea of Japan coast, the mountains stop almost mid-slope, a rise of lanky oaks giving way to vertical cliffs, some of them 30 storeys tall. The human population is so low here that tracks of tiger or bear can be more common along the sandy beaches than human prints. Inland, wild boar, musk deer and raccoons crash through the lush forests often unseen. Almost any foray into the wild brings some exciting discovery or remarkable encounter.Importantly, I’ve learned that Primorye is, more so than many other parts of the world, a place where humans and wildlife still share the same resources: fishermen and salmon, loggers and fish owls, hunters and tigers. Many parts of the world are too urban or overpopulated for such natural systems to exist. In Primorye, nature moves in a flow of interconnected parts. Primorye’s trees become floors in North America and Europe, and seafood from its waters is sold throughout Asia. Fish owls are a symbol of this functioning ecosystem, a demonstration that wilderness can still be found. This is what motivates me to continue my work. Despite the ever-increasing network of roads pushing deeper into the wild to extract timber and other natural resources, and the resulting threats to the owls, my Russian colleagues and I continue to actively collect information to learn more about these birds, share what we discover, and protect fish owls and the landscape.

And what do you gain? A huge wave of investment into the UK supply chain companies and a major boost to the economy,” he said.The government is consulting on new ways to run the renewable energy subsidy auctions, which could include setting the starting level, or reserve price, in line with forecasts for energy market prices so that energy bill payers are not called on to top up subsidies.This could mean more windfarms winning a contract, at no extra cost to bill payers.“Why constrain investment when we could be making the most of what we’ve got to grow the renewables sector?” Anderson said. “We know that we need more renewables, let’s just get the hell on with it.” In the last auction round, in September 2019, the winning bids from offshore windfarm developers tumbled by a third to about £40 per megawatt hour, which is less than the price of electricity in the wholesale energy market.Energy market experts said the record low subsidy levels could mean that households will not face extra costs to support the projects when they begin generating electricity, and might even help to bring down energy bills.A Europe-wide study of wind power subsidies from Imperial College confirmed last week that UK projects were likely to be the world’s first “negative-subsidy” offshore windfarms.Dr Malte Jansen, the study’s lead researcher, said: “Energy subsidies used to push up energy bills but within a few years cheap renewable energy will see them brought down for the first time. This is an astonishing development.”Subsidies are awarded through contracts that set the amount generators can earn for every megawatt-hour of electricity produced through a “strike price”. If the wholesale energy market price is lower than the strike price bill-payers top up the earnings, but if the strike price is lower than what generators earn from the wholesale market then they must pay the difference back.Imperial’s forecast for wholesale energy prices in the mid-2020s suggests that the strike price for new offshore windfarms is likely to be lower, meaning generators will effectively help to pay household energy bills.Dr Iain Staffell, from Imperial’s centre for environmental policy, said the new windfarms would be “pivotal” in helping the UK reach its net zero carbon emissions targets “with the added bonus of reducing consumers’ energy bills”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0785860321959633a38d0805490250d042fed5d9/0_177_4871_2922/master/4871.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a2b07bd4741a2a1d2d28160203cb3cf","title":"harrogate town notts county national league playoff final match report","story":"A full year since the National League began, it has finally been settled. Harrogate have reached the Football League for the first time in their history with a magnificent win over Notts County completing a fine performance under the greatest pressure.Even as empty seats surrounded the pitch for as far as the players could see, it was difficult not to feel the size of the occasion as the two teams took their places at Wembley. They could not have arrived at this moment under more contrasting circumstances. For Harrogate, a minuscule family-run club who have only been professional since 2017, this was the culmination of an arduous ascent up the leagues. County, meanwhile, have such a long and distinguished history that they were simply playing for a return to where they feel they belong.After both teams named unchanged lineups from their impressive play-off semi-finals, it seemed that perhaps the experience of the more established County could be the difference. Instead it was Town who burst into the match, pressing with energy and verve as they opened up the defence at will.Statistically the second best in the National League, the County defence has been one of the most impressive sights in non-league football this season. Here it was a mess. The defender Ben Turner said before the game that they were anticipating the Harrogate press and ready for it, but he turned out to be the weakest link and at the heart of so much that was poor.Within five minutes, the suffocating pressure told as Ryan Fallowfield drove down the right flank before rolling a perfect, low ball to George Thomson at the near post. He needed no further encouragement, sliding his finish hard and low beneath the goalkeeper. And 23 minutes later Thomson wreaked havoc again, this time whipping in an excellent free kick from the edge of the area which Connor Hall slipped into the net with the tip of a toe after shrugging off Turner.Harrogate were flying, yet it very clearly should have been more. Aaron Martin twice found himself clear on goal and was just a speck of composure between himself and a double. On both occasions he missed out.As fortunate as County were to depart the first half only two down, their response was admirable. Within a minute of the second half getting under way they won a free kick on the edge of the area and Callum Roberts curled a beauty into the bottom corner.The energy was immediately with them as they chased after an equaliser, dominating possession for much of the next 20 minutes. But the drinks break changed the atmosphere again. Within seconds of the restart Jack Muldoon was running free down the right flank before he launched a cross into the box which Jack Diamond stylishly slipped into the far corner to effectively kill the match.It was a day, a win and a performance that will live in Harrogate Town’s history for ever. When Simon Weaver started out as their manager in 2009 he could not have expected any of this. In his first year he did not see a penny for months and nor did some of his players, but he has been driven by a passion that still endures today. He is now the longest serving manager in all professional leagues and his team are in the Football League."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eccc2044330d1b6bba7e1827a6857c454898a644/53_35_2208_1325/master/2208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acaf19c94225657b211cd415d118e410","title":"mikel arteta arsenal fa cup final","story":"Manager has the heart and cutting edge of an evolving team. Things can progress if Aubameyang and Ceballos are securedFive minutes before half-time at Wembley Stadium, Mikel Arteta could be seen leaping out of his chalk rectangle and haring off down the touchline, feet battering the turf like an angry marionette, hands carving strange, jagged shapes in the air. Here was a man gripped suddenly with visions of collapse and disaster: planes falling from the skies, locusts across the sun, a tidal wave over the main stand.In fact the cause of Arteta’s panic was a slight drop in intensity from Ainsley Maitland-Niles, who was wandering a little vaguely on the left wing and failing to pursue, at just the wrong moment, the manager’s plan of attacking the space behind Chelsea’s full-backs. Maitland-Niles sprinted off into the space Arteta had seen, curving his run to meet a lovely floated pass from Kieran Tierney. And this was the pattern at times in the FA Cup final on Saturday, most notably in the half-hour after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had levelled the score at 1-1, as Arsenal boxed Chelsea in, overloaded the flanks and allowed their own highly mobile front three to exploit the tender spots in a slow-turning defence.It is, of course, easy to get ahead of things at moments such as these, and to forget that trophies are an end in themselves. Arsenal now have a 14th FA Cup to cheer. Arteta has a tangible success to sharpen the impression of a manager of real transformative energies. And as the final whistle blew it was unexpectedly touching to hear the unconfined shouts and shrieks of the players echoing around the empty stadium. Rob Holding in particular seemed overcome at winning the grand old founding trophy. For Aubameyang this is a domestic trophy on a par with any in his storied career.Still, though, this being football, it is always necessary to look at the next thing to extrapolate and speculate, and gauge the ultimate ceiling of this spike of progress. With this in mind it is those periods of smothering, fluent team-play that will occupy Arteta’s thoughts this summer. Victory on Saturday completes a run of 13 wins in 19 games, including an FA Cup win and a pass to Europe next year. In the last two and a half weeks this cut-and-shut team have beaten Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea. There is a sense of slack being taken up, of knots being smoothed. Something is happening here. But what?This was also another win against the head. Chelsea arrived at Wembley as the more settled squad. But Arsenal came with aces of their own, too. If Arteta has shown one outstanding quality, it is the ability to organise his team for one-off games against high-class opponents, to instil an intensity and attention to detail that has for many years been a defining Arsenal absence.There will be some unease at the nature of that progress, if only because victory at Wembley owed much to two players the club have to work to keep this summer. Aubameyang was a constant, gliding source of menace. He now has 70 Arsenal goals in 109 matches and seems, if anything, to be getting better. The wonky chain of logic that led to Mesut Özil’s contract of death – the idea that this is a player you just can’t afford to lose – actually does apply now. Get Aubameyang to stay and he can blaze a trail at the front of this evolving team.Behind him Dani Ceballos had an intriguing game: a semi-interested spectator for the first 20 minutes an assertive, quietly dominant presence for the rest. Arsenal must hope Ceballos will consider extending his loan period from Real Madrid. There is the heart and the cutting edge of an evolving team here. Ceballos and Aubameyang are vital to the project, if not quite the end of the project themselves.Wembley felt like a place of unresolved questions at kick-off, in an FA Cup final that will surely stand as the most eerily zombified of all these ghost-ship events. From a kind of corrugated raft somewhere high on the vast Wembley roof, a spot without any obvious support or means of access, the pre-recorded voice of Emeli Sandé was heard singing Abide With Me. Hopefully she took a stash of oatcakes and a bottle of whiskey up with her.The players kicked off in a polite hush. And in the fifth minute the Arsenal defence set about repelling Chelsea’s first attack with all the steely resilience of a collapsed meringue. There was a nice pass from Mason Mount and a lovely, super-fast switch of feet from Christian Pulisic. But this was a case of dribbling around the wheelie bins.Chelsea dominated those 21 minutes, pressing high, stealing the ball, and zipping their combinations about at speed. Given what happened next the only sensible conclusion is that Ceballos must have been extremely thirsty, because after the drinks break he was transformed. He is a fascinating player, a midfielder who trudges rather than runs, moving with all the sprightly ease of an escaped con in ankle-manacles making good his escape across a turnip swamp. But Ceballos is also a high-class midfielder, and at Wembley he manoeuvred the ball with purpose, blocking off Chelsea’s angles, and curating the wave of pressure either side of the equalising goal.In reality the change came from Arteta, who seems to have used the break to urge his players to target the gaps left by Reece James pushing high and by the lack of pace among the ageing Spanish contingent in Chelsea’s defence. Nicholas Pépé was once again dynamic and purposeful. Maitland-Niles worried away at James, allowing Aubameyang to float in on that side.Pépé smashed a wonderful shot into the top corner, only for offside to intervene. And moments later Aubameyang was pulled down by César Azpilicueta, who doesn’t have the gas in his legs for this foot race, so resorted instead to the power of arms. Aubameyang put the kick in the corner, a twitch of the hips sending Willy Caballero the wrong way.The winning goal stemmed from Ceballos doing something brilliantly ugly-clever, turning his back on Pedro to block him off and allowing the ball to run on into the path of Héctor Bellerín. He made a fine run forward. Pépé fed Aubameyang. What happened next was a wonderful miniature. Aubameyang dragged the ball left, leaving Kurt Zouma in a different timeline, before nudging it in a lovely parabola over Caballero and into the far corner, the kind of finish you can come up with when you have one strong foot and another even stronger oneThe referee aided Arsenal’s cause. Chelsea lost three important players on the day. But this was an afternoon of significant moments won, and of a glimpse into a more coherent future that Arteta will grasp at hungrily. At the final whistle he ran to hug Bellerín, then veered off to whisper something seductive in Aubameyang’s ear. The task of driving this team on starts right there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6eddc27633372499f12bbbe666a4046bd7fa130/0_127_3018_1811/master/3018.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e2d54d2b1f93fc79d9b1d749026c487","title":"celtic v hamilton scottish premiership live","story":"The inevitable Odsonne Edouard scored a hat-trick as the champions got off to a flyer in their quest to win a tenth consecutive league title“I’m delighted – it’s a fantastic start to the season. We were a little bit passive for my liking in the first half, but in the second half we showed what we’re about: real pace and power and some really good goals. We whipped them a bit at half-time, and in the end it was a really powerful performance.“People always talk about sending out a message – today was about winning and winning well. That’s it.” After a slowish start, Celtic looked ominously good against an intrepid but inferior Hamilton. Their through passing and crossing was devastatingly incisive in fact, the crosses for the first three goals were effectively through passes from a different angle.Odsonne Edouard scored a hat-trick of close-range finishes, Jeremie Frimpong added another and the substitute Patryk Klimala forced his way onto the scoresheet in the last minute.Peep peep! The champions return to action with a thumping victory.The goal was made by Jullien, who slid a long through pass down the inside-right channel. It loooked like Hamilton had everything covered, but then Klimala appeared from nowhere to surge onto the ball, hold off Hamilton and force a precise first-time shot into the far corner. It wasn’t the most elegant finish, but it was a triumph of sheer desire.That’s a terrific goal from the substitute Patryk Klimala!86 min A triple substitution for Celtic: Karamoko Dembele, Hatem Abd Elhamed and Patryk Klimala replace Frimpong, Christie and the hat-trick hero Edouard.85 min Taylor is booked for a tactical foul.84 min The match is starting to peter out - partly because both teams are tired, mainly because of the scoreline.81 min Jullien almost makes it five after staying forward following a corner, but Fulton denies him with another brave save.80 min McGregor angles a fine pass to Christie, who takes it in his stride and is about to shoot when Hamilton comes across to concede a corner.79 min “Big statement of intent from Celtic, Rob,” says Brendan Vahey. “The well-oiled machine looks up and running.”It was a decent statement from Rangers as well, in fairness. Celtic look so good, though, and even odds of 49 to win the title feel a bit long.77 min Moyo drives wide from 25 yards. Even at 4-1 down, Hamilton are attacking with puppy-dog enthusiasm.73 min Ogkmpoe’s shot is deflected behind - and he misses a good chance from the corner, flicking a near-post header across goal and eventually out for a throw-in. 72 min “It was a rough 21 hours between the Cup final and the start of Celtic’s season but somehow I made it through,” writes Gerry Scott. “The alterations that Lennon has made to our style since returning have made us more entertaining to watch compared to the rather sterile final six months of Brendan Rodgers. It sounds like both full backs have been playing well today. Frimpong in particular can be great fun to watch.”Yes, he’s one for the Joy of Six: infectious footballers. Both full-backs have been superb going forward, and Taylor’s two crosses for the first-half goals were Robertsonian in their precision.71 min A double change for Hamilton as well. Ciaran McKenna and Charlie Trafford replacing Callachan and Odoffin.70 min Olivier Ntcham comes on for Celtic to replace the impressive Elyounoussi.69 min Fulton makes another good save, beating away Elyounoussi’s shot. Once upon a time, Wales lost 7-1 to the Netherlands - and Neville Southall was the best player on the pitch. Fulton is having a mini-Southall today.67 min “That Elyounoussi dummy for Celtic’s first was a lesser spotted no-touch assist,” says Anthony Hill.That would make a decent list piece. You could include off-the-ball runs and even off-the-ball fouls (don’t watch the ball here, watch Mark Hughes).64 min Frimpong zips infield and plays a one-two with Forrest, whose angled return pass is quite glorious. Frimpong runs onto it and stabs a shot that is bravely saved by Fulton. The loose ball comes to McGregor, who heads it towards the Fulton-less goal. Odoffin, on the line, calmly takes it down on the chest and belts it clear.61 min Anyone out there?59 min Forrest cuts infield from the left and curls a lovely shot towards the far corner that is superbly tipped behind by the ing Fulton.57 min Ogkmpoe should have been given a second yellow card for that first touch. Had he miscontrolled it even slightly he would still have been able to get a shot in.56 min Ogkmpoe suddenly has a chance to make it 4-2, but his first touch is a custodial offence and his second is a foul of Jullien.55 min Ogkmpoe is booked for booting McGregor up in the air, prompting a brief exchange of views involving Scott Brown.Celtic opened Hamilton up with a superb move: Forrest fired the ball into Elyounoussi, who stabbed it through to the onrushing Christie. He opened his body to clip a left-footed shot that was pushed out by the ing Fulton, but Edouard reacted smartly to steer the ball into the roof of the net.It’s getting messy all right. Odsonne Edouard has completed his hat-trick!52 min Fulton is smartly off his line to beat Edouard to a through -ball. Brian Rice must be concerned that this will get messy for his young side. They don’t deserve to suffer a heavy defeat, but football doesn’t really care for such sentiment.It was another clean, clinical move from Celtic. Christie, just inside his own half on the right, flicked a defence-splitting pass down the line towards Forrest. He scurried onto the ball, looked up and curled a precise low cross that was finished with authority by Edouard.48 min Lots of Celtic pressure at the start of the second half, though nothing to alter Ryan Fulton’s pulse rate.46 min Peep peep! Hamilton begin the second half.Replays of Martin’s goal suggest the original shot was going wide, so it will probably go down as a Callum McGregor own goal. It hit him first and then Jullien before dribbling into the net.Peep peep! Celtic deserve to be ahead, but an intrepid Hamilton contributed fully to an entertaining half of football. Two devastating crosses from Greg Taylor left Odsonne Edouard and Jeremie Frimpong with open goals, but Scott Martin - who trained with Celtic as a bairn before being released - got Hamilton back into the match with an early contender for goal of the decade. See you soon for the second half.45+1 min Christie’s deep corner is met by another cracking volley from Jullien at the far post. This time it’s blocked by a Hamilton defender, as is his follow-up shot.45 min Elyounoussi picks up a loose ball and hits a deflected long-range shot that is comfortably held by Fulton. One minute of added time.44 min Celtic are zipping the ball around with increasing confidence. Hamilton look like they could do with a half-time breather.41 min Ronan Hughes has pulled something and is going off Marios Ogkmpoe replaces him. Look at him with four consecutive consonants in his surname, thinking he’s special.39 min “Afternoon Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “Good to have Scottish fitba back, and on the MBM, though it felt a bit strange to be watching at home yesterday with my virtual season ticket as Dundee United unfurled the Scottish Championship flag at Tannadice prior to a 1-1 draw with St. Johnstone. I missed being there, but at least I could have a drink at the game. And didn’t need to queue for the toilets. Or pay through the nose for my half-time snacks. Or listen to umpteen terrace MessisKlopps telling me and everybody else how it should be done. And I was home the second the full time whistle went. But as I said, I missed being there.”Association football: the most moreish misery around. (With the possible exception of English cricket.)

After 106 years, Harrogate Town are in the Football League! Enjoy the rest of the weekend – ta-ra. Neal Ardley tells Sky that he knew Harrogate would come out fast, but his team didn’t live with it. He acknowledges that better team won, but laments that too many of his players “didn’t turn up” and were nervous. He needed a perfect second-half performance to resolve things, and his team were better but not better enough. Now, he needs to look forwards, and is targeting automatic promotion next season. Jon Stead takes his medal, finds his cut-out of Jordan Sinnott, who was killed so tragically, and poses for a photo, tears in his eyes. My eyeballs might be sweating. He goes on to say they do a lot of work on shape, and have tightened up at the back. If you have “honest runners”, he says, you can afford to leave two players up the pitch, and 4-4-2 suits his players, who have pace, aggression and attacking intent.“Ecstatic ... it hasn’t really penetrated my brain yet,” says Simon Weaver. He goes on to praise “a group of honest lads”, and says that a lot has changed in the 11 years he’s been at the club, and going full-time gave them the impetus to do what they’ve done. It’s now Celtic 2-1 Hamilton Academical. Rob Smyth has the latest.As for Notts, they’re in a much better position than previously. They’ll be bullish about sorting things next season, and with decent reason. A little more quality and variety in their passing, and they’ll go close. Seriously. Sweet Caroline is back on. The influence of Daryl Gurney knows no bounds. Town jiggle and dance. What an effort! Falkingham does a little shuffle-turn, Jordan Henderson-style, and gives his lift some absolute welly. He can barely believe what he’s accomplished. The players fish medals out of a tray, while the Notts players and manager stand there applauding #classytouch #oldskoolHarrogate Town are in the Football League! He goes on to say that Town ought to have finished the game in the first half, but when they didn’t and Notts scored, their ability to manage the game allowed them to hang in there and strike back. Falkingham, the Town captain, struggles to find words. “It’s an emotional time,” he says. “We’re a bunch of lads that have been hungry ... we’ve never played in the Football League, the majority of us ... we’ve been building for this journey, it’s an amazing achievement ... amazing feeling ... och!”Notts huddle, and Ardley debriefs them, while Town jump about to the now obligatory Sweet Caroline. AI heard a rumour that there are other songs, but it might be wrong. “I bet Bill Fotherby is lighting another cigar somewhere with a big grin on his face,” says Brian Hamilton. “His clubs have had a great season.”Diamond says they planned to create chances and try to finish the game early. Town knew Notts would come back at them, and were ready to hold it down he’s now looking forward to an early night. What a performance! They flew at Notts from the off, handled a brief period of adversity, and were still looking for more in the sixth minute of injury time. Simon Weaver is now the longest-serving manager in the top our isions of the Football League!90+4 min Town are still at it! They get the ball into Stead, moving inside onto his right foot, and he punches a curler ... against the base of the post! What a performance this has been from Harrogate. 90+4 min Elsewhere, Odsonne Edouard has given Celtic the lead against Hamilton. You can follow that here. 90+2 min Sky give Diamond man of the match on account of “an important goal at an important time,” but I’d say that the match was won in the first half-hour, so would probably go for Thomson, who scored one and made one. 90+1 min “Buzzing for Harrogate Town being in the Football League,” says Ben Machell on Twitter. “Opposition firms trying to take Betty’s. Fruity orced mums in white Land Rover Evoques with “WELCOME TO HELL” banners. Shirtless Gareth Southgate letting off pyro by the cenotaph. Yes.”90 min There we go, a minimum of five added minutes. Harrogate Town are going to play in the Football League! 90 min What an achievement this is going to be. Town have come from nowhere, and they’ve put in a serious turning up this afternoon. They started at pace, maintained it, and save 15 minutes at the start of the second half, have looked a level above their opponents. 89 min Beck finds Diamond, who larrups a shot from distance straight at Slocombe. 87 min A change apiece: Town send Beck on for Muldoon, who looks like he’s spent the afternoon offering out the sun, while Notts replace Brindley with Kelly-Evans. 86 min Notts try to dig, but there’s nothing there. Town win the ball back and knock it about confidently, consuming time but threatening too. 83 min “Harrogate (‘arra gut’) posh?” incandesces Ian. “It’s known amongst the Yorkshire cognoscenti as being all fur coit and no knickers!”80 min This game is part of the 2019-20 season, while in Scotland, we’re already playing 2020-21. Bonkers. 78 min “Massive day for Harrogate AFC,” tweets Michael Kilpatrick. “Founded in 1914 and never been in the League.”If they get there, they’ll have earned absolutely all of it. 76 min We should note what a good change Town made, bringing on Stead. His experience and composure created what looks to be the clinching goal, BUT HERE COME COUNTY! They get the ball wide and Brindley hits the line, cutting back for Thomas, and it looks for all the world like he’s going to despatch a livener, but Belshaw parries his shot away and then Falkingham does brilliantly to stick absolutely all of him in the way of Doyle’s follow-up. 75 min “Will Harrogate be the poshest town to have hosted League football?” wonders my colleague Tom Davies on Twitter. “(Certainly felt the poshest I’d visited as an O’s fan a couple of years back).”I can’t think of any others.74 min Notts know the jig is up, and Town are dictating now. They had a little rough patch, but they’re back to looking by far the better team, and there’s Thomson smacking a shot into Slocombe’s midriff. 72 min On the touchline, Ardley was fuming, and well he might be. His team were good for 15 minutes, but that’s rarely enough to win a cup final, and his defenders have really let him down today. Stead does brilliantly, holding up, weaving by a challenge, and sticking the ball in behind, for Muldoon down the right. He crosses low, and there’s Diamond, haring onto it ahead of Brindley, who passes him on, to flick into the far corner! Town are going up! 70 min We go again. Deep breath. 67 min Have Town ridden it out? They’re starting to take control again, but as long as their lead stays at one goal, they will feel extremely vulnerable. 66 min And they nearly do now! Thomson finds the ubiquitous Fallowfield, who crosses low as he continues his run, and when Turner cuts it out, the ball drops to Thomson, who lashes wide. 64 min “That is such an awful kit!” emails Paulo Biriani. “County should be playing in their famous colours. What is going on in the world? Harrogate played Pompey in the cup this year and they gave us a mighty scare. They are a very good side. County will do well to beat them.”What is going on in the world? I don’t think anyone knows the answer to that one, but yes, even though Notts are on top now, Town look a better side, and I’d not be shocked if they scored a third.63 min Diamond cruises down the right and crosses, but his ball is behind Stead. Town have created near enough nothing in the second half. 61 min Stead replaces Martin. His tattoos appear to be fashionably distressed.60 min Jon Stead seems to be readying himself. 58 min Nice from Thomas, spinning Hall, who has a couple of hacks and connects with the second. He’s booked, and Notts have another free-kick in a position not dissimilar to the one from which Roberts scored. He’s a little further out this time, and pumps a shot well over the bar. I’d expect Town to change something, and soon. 57 min Ardley did his job at half-time. His players have been very good since then, and there’s Baldwin picking up a loose ball after Wooton challenges well, lamping a shot just wide. Town need to have a think, because the momentum of the game has changed. 55 min And now here come Notts, Roberts taking the ball across the face of the box and absolutely lashing a riser that swings just wide of the near post. That was a great strike, and looked to all the world like the equaliser. 55 min Fallowfield, who had a fine first half, finds himself in space outside the box and weaves around two challenges before Rose unloads him. 53 min Roberts hauls down Diamond and is booked. 52 min Nice from Notts, Rose playing a ball for Thomas down the right his cross is cleared. 52 min A quiet period, but Town have lost their intensity. It’s going to be a long old half for them, if they can’t relocate it. 50 min Boldewijn finds some space down the left, but runs out of pitch. Notts will be looking to get him on the ball at every opportunity. 48 min Things have changed. Notts look a different side. This is a great finish! Roberts, who was soo good in the semi, punches a curler into the far side-netting, Belshaw taking a step left only for the ball to go left! We got ourselves a ball-game!

The design can be as slick or as rudimentary as your budget and skills dictate.For those who have spent the past five months figuring out how to keep their sourdough starter alive, you’re probably more inclined to invest in a portable Ooni pizza oven (£229, uk.ooni), which runs on hardwood pellets, heats up in 15 minutes and will bake your sourdough crust to perfection in 60 seconds.At its simplest, an outdoor kitchen can be a fixed counter with storage above and below. The frame can be made from reclaimed timber (the base of an old workbench, for instance) or bare bricks. White painted breeze blocks also look neat and can be softened with potted herbs and wooden accessories.If you have space, an outdoor island will provide a place for people to perch while helping with the food prep. Ideally, it will be made from the same material as your linear set-up and could include an overhang for a couple of bar stools to slot under. Outdoor cooking nearly always gets messy, so choose a material that is hard-wearing and non-porous for your work surface. Reclaimed stone, slate or marble will work well. Alternatively – and if you’re really missing the Med – you could plaster your brick framework, paint it white and install a terracotta-tiled surface. If you know what you’re doing, cast concrete tops look great and weather well, too. If you don’t, check out the Dutch company, WWOO (wwoo.nl), which specialises in modular outdoor kitchens made from cast concrete.Your outdoor kitchen won’t need masses of storage, but it would be handy if you had somewhere to stash your fuel under the countertop. Outdoor shelving is a great idea, too, as it will keep your work surface clear of cutlery and condiments. Mount a length of reclaimed timber on to brackets along a fence or shed wall. Alternatively, check out the configurable, galvanised-steel system from the Swedish company String (from £42.50, utilitydesign). “S” hooks are another great storage solution, especially if you are forever misplacing your tongs.Dress your table with a sunny gingham cloth, perhaps a hand block-printed beauty (£70, mollymahon) and a set of life-improving napkins (£12 each, aerende), sewn by women who are up-skilling in a south London prison. If you’re out after dark, a rechargeable, battery-powered table lamp (£49, modafurnishings) will create atmosphere.The Dutch design brand Zuperzozial make a range of colourful cutlery from plant fibres (from £7 a set, formahouse), and there are some beautiful eco paper plates to be found if you know where to look (£10 for 8, merimeri). When the time comes to clear away, you’ll need a crate, not a tray. Try stackable, collapsible crates in a bright candy colour (£11, hay.dk). Pile them high with dirty tumblers and tableware and leave them until morning.

It’s certainly telling that the coronavirus-scuppered live dates that had been booked for this year were being touted as that record’s 25th anniversary tour, her first album in eight years seemingly not worthy of promotion. And yet Such Pretty Forks in the Road doesn’t deserve to have been so completely glossed over.Yes, musically, these songs – all co-written with former Morrissey sideman Michael Farrell –are for the most part her stock-in-trade windswept power ballads and unremarkable soft rock. But while there’s nothing as thrillingly angry as You Oughta Know, it’s a far more palatable set than 2012’s insipid Havoc and Bright Lights. That’s in part because while that album was so full of psychobabbling, spiritual guff it could have made Gwyneth Paltrow choke on her vagina-scented candles, this time around Morissette has returned to the confessional writing style that defined her earlier work. The dramatic Reasons I Drink is as direct as its title, fearlessly tackling alcohol problems and eating disorders. It’s just unfortunate that it has little regard for scansion, syntax or sense. Indeed, her lyrics have long been an achilles heel, and when she sings: “I can’t remember where the sentence started when I’m trying to finish it,” you wonder whether she’s poking fun at herself. On reflection, probably not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1cd139a9197b6983ad8393b6cc009e5000b6024/0_353_4259_2555/master/4259.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a25eecd1c5cb421830bbc69e4cfceaf7","title":"brandy b7 review back on her own terms","story":"The familiar acrobatic vocals and sublime harmonies are there, but the R\u0026ampB star’s first album in eight years is not all about nostalgia…It’s been eight years since Brandy’s last album – forgivable for someone who’s “been an original since 1994”, as she boasts on I Am More on this new one.

Brandy’s trademark raspy vocals and sublime harmonies on Rather Be and Lucid Dreams are nostalgia-inducing for anyone who grew up listening to her acrobatic riffs and runs. Baby Mama featuring Chance the Rapper is a rhapsody to her 18-year old daughter and an anthem for single mothers. “I’m every woman,” she sings, evoking Chaka Khan and Whitney Houston.Perhaps Brandy shouldn’t quit her day job when it comes to rapping – her attempt on High Heels is so-so – but the singer sure knows how to duet. Love Again, featuring Daniel Caesar, ripples with lavish melodies, and their layered and distinct voices marry to create the bespoke cocktail your strange summer’s been missing.

The case was brought by the housing charity Shelter.Polly Neate, the chief executive of Shelter, welcomed the court ruling when it was made, but she told the  that hundreds of people had contacted the housing charity since the ruling raising concerns about the DSS issue.Neate said: “Hundreds of people have since contacted our services with similar stories and we are still hearing of letting agents and private landlords ignoring the judgment.”Iffat Saif, a lawyer, who with her husband and two children is in receipt of housing benefit following a recent grant of leave to remain in the UK after fleeing persecution in Pakistan, said she had called 57 landlords and letting agents since the ruling. All either turned her down when she mentioned the word “DSS” or told her she needed to provide a guarantor who would guarantee the tenancy for £50,000.“We want to work hard here but we have only recently got our leave to remain in the UK and it will take time for us to sort ourselves out,” she said.After leaving Home Office accommodation in Southall, west London, that was infested with rats and cockroaches the family has moved into an emergency hostel for homeless people where the family of four are crowded into one room.“I’m so worried about the risk of infection for my children in this place. Large numbers of people are sharing the same bathrooms and toilets and we are very overcrowded in one room. The council told us we should contact landlords and letting agents ourselves to try to find accommodation. I called 57 landlords and when I told them we are DSS they all said no.”She said the landlords did not seem to be aware of the recent court ruling outlawing discrimination against DSS tenants.Saif eventually found a guarantor, a contact in the UK she made while working as a lawyer in Pakistan.“A landlord has finally agreed to rent a property to us so we can at last leave the emergency hostel. But many people in receipt of DSS support do not have access to a guarantor who can offer to support them with £50,000.”Neate said: “The recent court judgment was an incredibly important step forward, but Shelter has been fighting ‘No DSS’ for nearly two years and will continue to do so until these discriminatory practices are stamped out for good. All landlords and letting agents should know that if they keep acting unlawfully, they could face legal action and hefty fines.”Jon Hardy, a Bristol member of Acorn, a community-based union of tenants, workers and residents, said: “While it’s welcome news that ‘No DSS’ tenancy bans have been declared unlawful in the recent landmark court ruling, it comes as no surprise to hear that some landlords are still refusing people who receive housing benefits. Everyone deserves a decent home and housing is a right, not an investment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0474caa4c27b9188fe5929ca9dc31f6f306c04b6/240_0_3506_2105/master/3506.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f851f8d73df0a5a1e65c8a6d11ca0a98","title":"lewis hamilton hangs on to win british grand prix after puncture drama","story":"Lewis Hamilton won the British Grand Prix for the seventh time, coming home after last minute drama almost ended his race with a puncture on the final lap. He crawled round on three wheels, dragging his car over the line just seconds in front of Red Bull’s Max Verstappen in second. The Dutchman had pitted just beforehand to take new tyres to go for the fastest lap, had be not done so the win would surely been his.The British driver’s Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas had been with him for most of the race until the Finn had too a front left puncture with two laps to go and finished in eleventh. The two Mercedes had been nonetheless comfortably clear of the rest of the field, their superiority this season plain to see through Silverstone fast corners. Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc was in third, with Renault’s Daniel Ricciardo in fourth and McLaren’s Lando Norris in fifth.The late spectacular drama enlivened what had been a straightforward affair. Hamilton had control almost from the off and after he and Bottas had quickly built a lead, the pair settled into a somewhat uninspiring run to the flag. Hamilton had his teammate bested from the off and the Finn did not get close enough to mount a challenge. It is 70 years since the old airfield hosted the very first F1 world championship race in 1950, won by Giuseppe Farina for Alfa Romeo . The Italian marque completed a clean 1-2-3 sweep that day, and Mercedes were in similar control this time. Until the wheels came off in the dying moments.Hamilton’s 87th career win, his seventh at the British Grand Prix ensures yet another record has fallen to the British driver. He has one more victory in his home race than the previous best of six held by Alain Prost in France. Few milestones remain and none seem beyond Hamilton now. He is only four behind Michael Schumacher’s record of 91 race wins, a tally which will surely fall to him this season. On this form and with Mercedes in a two-horse fight for the title, Hamilton is clear favourite to match Schumacher’s seven drivers’ titles, he now leads the championship with 88 points, a full 30 in front of Bottas.After complaints from the drivers after a rushed and disorganised gesture in Hungary and Hamilton addressing the sport’s leaders, the FIA and F1 organised a set time and presentation for the drivers to make an anti-racism statement on the grid. They had all made inidual televised anti-racist statements before hand and then lined up together before the national anthem. They were all present and wearing “End Racism” t-shirts, Hamilton and the majority once more took a knee but the split with some drivers still unwilling to do so remained. Seven drivers stood, Kevin Magnussen joining the six who previously done so, Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, Kimi Raikkonen, Daniil Kvyat, Carlos Sainz and Antonio Giovinazzi.Hamilton had a slow start and was almost passed by Bottas thought the first corner, just clinging to his lead on the outside line of Abbey. Bottas was cautious, easing at the apex where he could have legitimately squeezed Hamilton. It was, until the death, the only moment of the race he was threatenedA safety car was deployed on the opening lap as Kevin Magnussen went off after tangling with Alex Albon. Racing resumed on lap six and Hamilton quickly demonstrated the pace advantage they held, putting four seconds on Verstappen by lap eight. For Ferrari the chasm they face this season was starkly illustrated, Leclerc was 12 seconds off the lead with just 10 laps completed.Daniil Kvyat appeared to lose the rear in his AlphaTauri and went off at the entrance to Maggots, a very high speed crash with a major impact but the driver emerged unscathed. The incident brought out the safety car once more on lap 13 and the teams used the opportunity to pit and take the hard tyres – their only stop of the race completed.Bottas stayed in touch with Hamilton, keeping him honest to within just over a second but apparently unable to close enough to threaten the world champion. By half distance Hamilton had two seconds on his teammate and looked entirely serene leading the race.Behind him Leclerc was chased down by both McLaren’s having another fine afternoon in already impressive season. Sainz and Norris were up to fifth and sixth, comfortably the strongest of the midfield teams and a clear threat to Ferrari this season.Relentlessly in control out front however the two Mercedes were managing the race in a controlled if entirely unspectacular fashion. They had 10 seconds on Verstappen by lap 33 and their run to the flag remained untroubled. Hamilton was enjoying even more pace in the final stags, putting eight seconds on Bottas as the flag beckoned. Then the left fronts went for both drivers. Bottas had no choice but to pit, Hamilton had simply good fortune to thank that he was on his final circuit and could nurse his crippled car across the line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/710283e4389eeba6fce47996f4d67484bdbe3a33/0_279_7158_4295/master/7158.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=883d7ae917eab5766a947ec1f3335de2","title":"stuart broad considered retirement dropped england cricket","story":"Stuart Broad has revealed he was “so down” after being dropped for the first Test against West Indies that he considered retiring.Broad, who claims he is bowling as well as ever and has never been fitter, returned to the side for the second and third Tests and the 34-year-old played a key role as England hit back to win the series 2-1.“Were there thoughts of retirement going round my head? One hundred per cent. Because I was so down,” he told the Mail on Sunday. “I was expecting to play, which is always a bit of a dangerous thing in sport but I felt I deserved to play.”Broad explained that the coronavirus restrictions placed on all the players during the Test series did not help as he tried to come to terms with being dropped for the first Test in Southampton.“I have not really told anyone this but I was so down that week of the first Test. I was really low. I was stuck in that hotel. I couldn’t go anywhere. I wasn’t playing, I was staying in a single room. I didn’t sleep for two days. I was nowhere. A different decision could definitely have been made with my emotions of how I was feeling.”Broad said his family had played a crucial role in helping him through the period – as had Ben Stokes, who was captain for the first Test.“Stokesy was brilliant,” Broad said. “Stokesy knocked on my door on the Thursday night and stayed in the corridor to talk to me. He said: ‘This isn’t about cricket, but how are you mate?’ That was very impressive for him to do. In this modern world, sometimes face-to-face comfort can get lost. I have always had a huge amount of respect for Stokes and I will be friends with him for life, but what he did almost added to that.”Broad, who became the seventh player in history to take 500 Test wickets in the third Test, insists he is a better player now than he was 10 years ago and that age should be no barrier. “I might have been more exciting when I was 24 or have been more unpredictable so a bit more interesting to watch, but there is no doubt that a captain would rather have me bowling for him now than when I was 24. “I have seen a lot of numbers over the past week since I took my 500th wicket. The last 18 months, I have been averaging 20.5 per wicket in Test cricket. Take age out of that. If anyone were doing that at any age, you would want to keep them around the team for a bit and not look past it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8f17cfe4e80171f6a9513716b7d7c4681c29ec0/134_74_2778_1666/master/2778.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a777d40a729d846abd7f5db58e11ce34","title":"tatiana golovin women tennis wta","story":"Days after Kim Clijsters announced her return last September, the Russia-born French player did likewise after retiring aged 20In the dying months of the 2007 women’s tennis season, a new contender was emerging. As Justine Henin dominated the world, for a few fleeting weeks the second best player around was a 19-year-old from France named Tatiana Golovin. It had been a long time coming.Golovin grew up at Florida’s famous Bollettieri academy from the age of seven, in perpetual competition with Maria Sharapova. By 16 she was ranked 26th and a prodigy, the 2004 WTA newcomer of the year. Injuries and pressure followed, but she finished 2007 on the verge of exceptional results. “I felt everything was coming together,” she remembers.Instead, it all fell apart. In her first tournament of the following season, her back began to throb. Golovin saw a parade of doctors and was eventually diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis, a chronic inflammatory spinal disease. At 20, her career was over and she departed as one of the great lost talents of her era. That was the end of the narrative until two crazy days in September last year. Twenty‑four hours after Kim Clijsters announced her second return, Golovin emerged with news of an even more startling comeback and she reappeared shortly after. However, her revival has not been everything for which she hoped.This has been a time for contemplation in tennis as the WTA tentatively returns this week in Palermo, with players considering whether to travel to New York for the US Open. For Golovin, it has been time to consider the next step of her entire career.Even after the most satisfying careers, retirement can be an athlete’s greatest obstacle. Golovin had spent her entire youth working towards the goal of being a top player, only for it to be snatched from her. In her first months of retirement she felt shame and helplessness. She swore never to work in tennis again, but she also knew nothing else.“What do you do? You’re 20 years old,” she says. “I had friends who were just getting out of school and were like: ‘Oh we’re gonna travel the world.’ I’m like: ‘Well I’ve actually been all over the world already.’ So, what’s the next step?”After declining several offers to work as a tennis pundit, Golovin eventually acquiesced and has been a regular presence on French television for a decade. With her young family and her partner, the France and Toulon rugby player Hugo Bonneval, she seems happy. But some scars never fade. Golovin still dreams of her matches yet memories of her playing career are a blur.At Wimbledon last year Pauline Parmentier of France observed that Golovin sounded more like a journalist than a former player, after a decade in the booth. Golovin winced. After some thought, she returned to her accommodation, gathered her family together and spontaneously announced that she would compete again. “No one paid attention to me,” she says, laughing. “They just continued with their dinner.”But it was not a joke. Eighteen months earlier, Golovin had learned that new treatments could help to manage her back condition and with her son turning two years old she had more free time. She wondered what she could do to supplement her self-confidence and the answer was clear. “The only thing I knew to do better than someone else was to play tennis. I think it was maybe more getting that confidence again about who I am … Can I still do what I was meant to do and what I was one of the best at?“She returned at a WTA event in Luxembourg with only six weeks of practice. She fell 6-3, 6-1 against the No 131 Kaja Juvan of Slovenia, but she was proud and it felt like a start. However, she had competed with an abdominal strain, which was soon accompanied by fractured ribs. In the new year, she then hurt an elbow. Her body was seemingly falling apart. After only one more match she was forced to sit down and consider whether she could fully devote herself to the sport.“Tennis is supposed to be your whole life. Unfortunately it wasn’t my whole life because I have kids and they’re my number one priority and always will be. I thought I could have two priorities … tennis doesn’t want balance. It has to be your only baby.”As she considered her next step, the world shut down and she cloistered in the French countryside with her family. With the tour in disarray, there is no rush to decide on her future and she is relaxed about it. Still, despite explaining the size of the commitment, it still seems desired. She even floats the possibility of returning first to doubles in order to ease back in. But after so many years, in some ways she has already won. There is triumph in the simple fact that, 11 years after quitting, she was able to authentically feel like a tennis player once again.“Mentally I feel a lot freer than I did in the past 10 years because I know that I can play. I can go out there and try to play if my back holds up and I had a great time doing it. It’s just a matter of what do I want to do. Why not? We’ll see.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0719271d5e55afe11c5e2a83549cefbe3de26b24/0_164_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e494c7e7fe2fd132889b421ff24a4772","title":"british grand prix 2020 formula one f1 silverstone live updates","story":"The world champion survived a puncture on the last lap to hold off Max Verstappen to win his seventh British GPHere’s Giles Richards’ report on a British Grand Prix of rare late drama. Here’s the final placings, overall standings to follow but Hamilton is 30 points clear from Bottas. Charles Leclerc, the forgotten man who came third speaksIt was a very, very tricky race. We have been very lucky. We have done the best of what we can do today. The performance of the car is not where we want it to be but I am very happy. The British and German national anthems ring out, as full-mask order is obeyed across the board. It’s lucky and unlucky. The tyres didn’t look great. Then Valteri got a puncture Then Lewis got a puncture. I am very happy with second. It was pretty lonely trying to look after the tyre. Hamilton has a peek at his tyre. It was hanging off the wheel. That was close. That was a seventh British GP win for Hamilton, surely headed for his seventh world title, but it was a close-run thing. He almost suffered a similar fate to Bottas here. It’s a 30Verstappen takes second as he takes the fastest lap. Leclerc took third and disaster for Bottas as he drops to 11th. Ricciardo was fourth, and Norris fifth. Ocon is sixth, Gasly seventh. Albon had eighth. Stroll ninth. The big question is whether Verstappen could have won that without that pit stop? It seems his tyres were OK. He got the fastest laps but surely could have overtaken Hamilton on the last lap. 5252 Sainz has tyre problems. Hamilton is told to protect his car as his tyres are in a similar problem. Can he hang on? Verstappen is four corners behind. Hamilton grinds home. Verstappen is unlikely to catch him. Hamilton’s tyres hanging off the wheel. 5152 Verstappen come in to pit to see if he can set a fastest lap. Bottas’ problems gave him a free hit. Bottas pits as Leclerc and other pass. Bottas is in 12th. Albon is 10th. Will Hamilton’s car do the same? 5052 Bottas has gone. Oh no. His car is all over the place and Verstappen has overtaken him. Drama! Bottas is back in third, the tread is off his tyre. 4952 Stroll and Gasly are at each other and Gasly goes into ninth. Bottas is really struggling, and Verstappen has under six seconds to make up. 4852 Bottas, who was complaining about his tyres, has dropped back on Hamilton. Is Verstappen going to be able to take advantage. Raikkonen has a problem and a bit’s dropped off his car. 4752 Stroll has a black and white flag for that Ocon clash. Albon sets a fastest lap as he chases Vettel. 4652 Ocon and Stroll clash again and Ocon goes into eighth. It could have been nasty, but Ocon pulled back. Albon takes Giovanazzi and has poor Vettel in his sights. In tenth is Gasly. 4552 Albon takes on Russell and Giovanazzi in an attempt to climb from 14th into 12th, and he gets into 13th as Russell is struggling. 4452 Grosjean and Ricciardo’s incident will be investigated after the race. Grosjean is still last so it will not have too much effect on his race - or anyone else’s. 4352 Bottas’ tyres do look blistered. Just like Hamilton. Cause for concern? It’s probably down to Verstappen to put the cat among the pigeons. 4252 Stroll and Ocon’s battle continues to be the one to watch. Vettel is back in 11th, and struggling. He’s had a nightmare weekend. He might get 10th, but only because Gasly was a naughty boy. 4152 Hamilton’s right front a cause for concern? Seems to be a blister. That seems to be a potential cloud on the horizon. Bottas also seems concerned. Verstappen now has the fastest lap. Could there be drama in the last ten laps? 4052 Stroll is worried and telling his team so, and Esteban Ocon can overtake him soon, it seems likely. That’s the battle for eighth. 3952 Vettel is back in 11th but seems to have been held off by Gasly. More business for the stewards to deal with. 3852 Kevin Magnussen is talking, and sounds hugely disappointed by that crash. He is rooting for Grosjean his Haas teammate. “Just gutted,” he says. 3752 Grosjean, who has been running on old tyres, comes in to the pits. Footage of the Ricciardo overtake puts him in potential lumber. The pit was not great either, and he’s now in last place. 3652 Antonio Giovinazzi of Alfa Romeo has a five-second penalty for a safety-car infringement. Grosjean passed by Ricciardo finally as the Frenchman does his best - and somewhat naughtily - to hold off the Aussie. It doesn’t work and that might have set the stewards’ nose twitching. 3552 Max Verstappen is asking his team to keep drinking. He’s bored as he has had something of a lonely race in third. He is nailed on, barring a blow-out, to finish in that position. Romain Grosjean is holding off Ricciardo in seventh and having great fun out there. 3452 Hamilton takes back the fastest lap. He and Bottas have been swapping those all race. Mercedes have the race all to themselves. 3352 It’s not been a classic so far. Twelve laps of a safety car will do that. 3252 Bottas sets a fastest lap again. He’s within 1.4 seconds of Hamilton. 3152 Some footage of Hamilton shows just how fast he is flying. Albon comes in for his five-second penalty and then has his tyres to come on. He drops to last place in the field - 17th - we have lost three for this race.3052 Verstappen is in third, way ahead of Leclerc. There is not much action happening up on the front two rows. 2952 Mike Bowen on the safety car: “We’ve got quicker Tuk tukks here on Diani Beach Kenya!” Bottas has just set a fastest lap by contrast, and shaved almost half a second off Hamilton. 2852 Nico Hulkenberg is talking. “It’s disappointing, we didn’t manage to start the car.” With any luck, he gets a run-in to the 70th anniversary race held here at Silverstone. “It is what it is,” he says, using the champion glib phrase du nos jours. 2752 Stroll and Ocon clash again. Ocon takes the long way round and Stroll holds him off. 2662 Grosjean has been warned over his clash with Sainz - a black and white flag - any more messing and he may well find himself getting a penalty. 2552 Grosjean was passed by Norris to swap sixth for seventh. Hamilton is opening up his gap on Bottas - it’s up to two seconds now. 2452 Lando Norris fancies a crack at Grosjean and gets past him at Stowe corner. Ricciardo is holding off Stroll with some ease despite the Australian not being happy with his tyres. 2352 Hamilton’s advantage on Bottas is dropping a little but the Mercedes are still imperious. It’s around 1.2 seconds at the moment and he has just set a fastest lap so all is well with the world champion. 2252 Sainz fancies taking fifth off Grosjean. He’s not happy with Grojean’s changing of direction in the braking zone. Sainz eventually speeds by. 2152 Albon is up for a penalty - five seconds - as the stewards have decided he was responsible for the Magnussen crash. It’s not been a good day for him. 2052 Romain Grosjean, who didn’t swap tyres during the safety car delay, is in fifth but will need to pit at some point. He’s just enjoying the ride for the moment. 1952 Back racing: Hamilton goes away from the front. The battle is between Ricciardo who holds off Norris who then attempts to go past Sainz. Sixth to ninth is where the action is. Sainz, Norris and Ricciardo are all involved in the fight for sixth. Stroll and Ocon are fighting over ninth.

Now, aged 80, she explains why she’s making time for them, alongside regular tennis and core-strengthening pilatesThe card dropped through the letterbox just as I was leaving for my regular coaching session at the tennis club. “Welcome to your ninth decade,” it said. I’d just turned 80 and was planning to celebrate by doing a tandem skye for a local charity.I wasn’t shocked by the card’s message (no, really). I was prepared by the good-ageing philosophy of a thoughtful man called Cecil Kellehar who was fourscore years when he wrote for Choice, the lifestyle magazine for over-50s that I edited in the 1990s. Take it as it comes. Don’t rail against it. Have someone to love. Have something to do. Have something to look forward to. Keep fit.The last one’s easy: I’ve played tennis since I was 10 and do so three times a week if I can. I’d even been asked to join an over-75s group playing indoors every week. Covid-19 and the lockdown ended that, as well as something else I was really looking forward to: jumping out of a plane. Meanwhile, I’m in a weekly Zoom choir and we happily sing out to our heart’s content.I’ve got a husband and family (at a distance) to love and I’m always writing (journalists are like that), so that is certainly something to do. Emailing my MP about doing more to erase the inequalities revealed by the pandemic keeps me occupied.“Take it as it comes”, was my dad’s philosophy too. But sometimes you just can’t accept what life throws at you. Incontinence, for instance. Reading Miriam Margolyes’ frank account of hanging on to her pee, I related instinctively. We all know if you laugh for too long you can leak!But why on earth should it happen? Why is it so commonplace? At the end of the 1960s, after I’d had my two daughters, the health visitor encouraged me to do pelvic floor exercises daily. But I was a full-time working mother with a mortgage, and life went at such a speed that I never paid enough attention to my own body. When my son arrived in the mid 1970s, living pace was even faster – and tennis was put on hold.By the mid 1980s, I was back on the court, expending energy and eradicating angst built up from working long hours on women’s magazines. Fashion, beauty makeovers and diets, Princess Diana and Fergie, royal gardens and fabulous knitting patterns kept me occupied. It was a strange time. My periods were all over the place, as were my emotions – and I was putting on weight.It’s marvellous that we talk freely about women’s health today and it’s easier to find a sympathetic ear and a wealth of options to deal with oestrogen deficiency and menstrual problems. My heart went out to British tennis player Heather Watson whose performance in an important tournament was affected by the time of the month. Now you can avoid periods entirely if you want, with no ill effects – certainly no red or wet patches on tennis whites.My solution was twice-yearly HRT implants, which kept me stable until the 1990s, when I unexpectedly started leaking urine. My GP said my bladder had prolapsed, dropped down into my vagina, so I began doing pelvic floor exercises with a vengeance. I was inspired by Diana Moran, the Green Goddess, who created a range of keep-fit exercises for Choice. She made it all look so easy!At 60, I retired, just after the second of my older sisters died of ovarian cancer. Fearing this would be my fate, too, I used some pension money to go private to remove my womb and ovaries – and had a bladder “lift”. Fortunately, it didn’t involve the mesh, which has been devastating for many and is now banned. Mine was just a stitch, my surgeon said.For 10 years, every Saturday morning I attended a pilates class – our lovely instructor Lidia helped us focus on strengthening the core: making the abdomen and back muscles stronger helps your pelvic floor muscles to control the bladder. We lay on our backs, breathing deeply in and out as we lowered first one leg then the other to the side, eight to 10 times.I kick myself that I didn’t continue with pilates after we moved to the country. The wee problems recurred and I was back to wearing pads. Things improved a little when my GP suspected vaginal atrophy – caused by lack of oestrogen – and prescribed Vagifem, oestradiol tablets inserted like a pessary.Despite all this, I found I still often make an urgent dash for the loo. As a consumer journalist for more than 45 years, I’m always looking for ways to make things better. Panties with integral pads are useful, as accidents are contained. I bought a Kegel8 Ultra 20 electronic pelvic toner, a device with a spoon-like object that goes into the vagina. It was difficult to lie down for half an hour a day with this in place, and I discovered the prolapse was back. This doesn’t happen to everyone, I hasten to say.Then I read about Finnish Innovotherapy, a non-invasive training method using specially designed shorts and electrodes to generate contractions of the muscles. Five days a week, 30 minutes a day over 12 weeks certainly improved my awareness of my pelvic floor and the leaking lessened. It was a costly remedy: I bought it over six months, interest free. It may not be a realistic option for everyone – and you still have to do exercises.One thing I’ve learned about myself is that I need to be given instructions, and having downloaded MyPFF app onto my iPad I squeeze and breathe to order. And there’s new hope: I came across Alex Miller, a Canadian fitness trainer, who believes she has found why our pelvic floor muscles lose their ability to work properly. As we age, we slump! Do you notice yourself hunching over – when you’re using a laptop, driving, sitting at the table or in an armchair. Instead of being upright, our head and chin go forward, as does the abdomen. Raise your shoulders and chin, bring your head back and your body is properly aligned.Her combination of pilates and yoga exercises have shown me the error of my ways. I sit up straight, hold my tummy muscles in, breathing deeply in and out, and try to remember to use MyPFF app every day. When Covid-19 is gone, I’ll be ready to jump out of the plane – wearing a parachute, and hopefully no pad!As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

She has also been the most strident with her beliefs.“Q is a patriot,” Greene said in 2017, referring to her belief in the conspiracy theory’s anonymous online poster who claims to have knowledge of a secret ring of powerful, deep-state sex-traffickers and pedophiles, and is said to be a part of the Trump administration.“He is someone that very much loves his country and is on the same page as us, and he is very pro-Trump. He appears to have connections at the highest levels.”Greene is running for the state’s 14th congressional district, where in August she needs to overcome a Republican opponent she has already bested in the primary, then challenge a Democrat for the reliably Republican seat. Her bid will probably be helped by an endorsement from Trump in June, but if she and others win in November, experts say it could boost the popularity of the theory even more by arriving in the nation’s halls of power. “If these people do get into office – and I think several probably will, because of the nature of the districts they’re running in – this potentially gives them a platform to spread QAnon,” said William Partin, a disinformation analyst at Data \u0026amp Society, a non-profit research organization.“I think it’s clear at this point that it’s detrimental in a wide range of ways, in terms of interpersonal relationships, actual criminal activity and violence.”It was a QAnon believer who, heavily armed, entered a DC Pizza parlor in December 2016, prepared to take on a child sex ring supposedly being run by Hillary Clinton out of the restaurant’s basement.In 2019, the alleged New York mob boss Francesco Cali was shot and killed by a man who said he was obsessed with QAnon and believed Cali was part of a deep state conspiracy against Trump. In April this year a woman inspired by QAnon videos traveled to New York armed with more than a dozen knives, in an alleged attempt to kill Joe Biden.None of those incidents have stopped candidates such as Angela Stanton King – like Greene, a Georgia-based candidate for Congress – from posting QAnon messaging.Media Matters, a not-for-profit progressive research center which monitors misinformation, has counted 67 current or former congressional candidates who have embraced QAnon.Along with Greene and Stanton King, Lauren Boebert, running for the House in a traditionally Republican district in Colorado, has spoken approvingly of QAnon.“Everything I’ve heard of Q, I hope that this is real because it only means America is getting stronger and better”, Boebert said in an interview in May. Like some others, she has since distanced herself from the movement in the wake of media attention.Others include Mike Cargile, a House candidate in California, who included the hashtag “WWG1WGA” a QAnon slogan which stands for “Where we go one, we go all” – in his Twitter profile, and Billy Prempeh, running in New Jersey, who posted a photo of himself next to a QAnon flag on Facebook.Elsewhere, Jo Rae Perkins, the Republican candidate for Senate in Oregon, claimed in January there is a “very strong probabilitypossibility that Q is a real group of people, military intelligence, working with President Trump”.Travis View, the co-host of the QAnon Anonymous podcast, which tackles the conspiracy theory, said that QAnon followers tend to be “extremely politically active”, both in terms of voting and promoting candidates online.That could be one reason why there has so far been little condemnation of these candidates, or of QAnon itself, from senior Republicans.“I cannot find a Republican leader who has said a bad thing about QAnon,” View said.“I’m so fascinated by the weird line that Republican leadership is walking right now. Republicans cannot afford to spare a single vote, so they need to get as many voters on board as possible.“That may explain why they’re doing this weird dance where they don’t want to say a bad word about QAnon, but also not give any explicit endorsement to QAnon either.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1edfa27e15a0f616ead49602d19e0d9a1b7671d4/0_287_4311_2587/master/4311.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0830da121f745ce4d7026ed127070658","title":"gop reportedly bans media from republican national convention due to covid 19 live","story":"William Barr was hungry. “Mr Chairman, could we take a five-minute break?” the attorney general asked Jerry Nadler of the House of Representatives’ judiciary committee. “No,” retorted Nadler, his hearing almost done. Barr responded sardonically: “You’re a real class act.”It was pure Barr: a proud, combative, unflappable and unapologetic partisan warrior in the loyal service of the White House.During the five-hour session on Capitol Hill in Washington this week, Barr made clear why he has been dubbed Donald Trump’s faithful protector and personal henchman. He defended using federal forces in US cities, denied giving Trump’s allies favorable treatment and demurred on issues such as foreign election interference or whether November’s poll can be postponed.For critics, it was proof positive that Barr’s unswerving loyalty to the president has torn down the wall that separates the White House and justice department and ensures law enforcement operates independent of politics. Some believe he now poses an existential threat to democracy itself.You can read the full article below:New York governor Andrew Cuomo said Covid-19 figures in his state are “all very good news” in a briefing on Sunday.At the height of the pandemic in New York, the state was recording hundreds of deaths a day. On Sunday, three deaths were reported and 556 people were hospitalized with Covid-19, a figure that Cuomo said is “the lowest number since we began.” A total of 531 people tested positive for Covid-19 in the state over the last 24 hours, out of 58,951 tests.As well as his appearance on CNN, Democrat congressman Jim Clyburn has also appeared on CBS’s Face the Nation.He is asked whether the Democrats are hurting Americans by failing to agree a new deal with the Republicans to aid people taking an economic hit during the pandemic.Clyburn worked as a teacher before entering politics, and he is asked whether he would be happy returning to school if he was still in the profession.“Absolutely not, not until we have a national plan that the school district here in South Carolina ought to be coordinated,” he says. “We can’t have children going to school when we have not laid out a plan for there to be social distancing, for there to be everybody required a mask. I saw where a school district down in Georgia, I believe, they are saying well you’ve got to have a mask on the bus but in the classroom is optional. Come on. That’s not the way to run this stuff.”He also says that broadband needs to be available to everyone, especially in rural communities, to help with distance learning.“That’s why I have been such a long time proponent of having universal access to broadband,” he says. “Everything that’s great about this country, and the Internet is one of those great things, it ought to be accessible, ought to be affordable for everybody.”According to one congressional candidate for America’s House of Representatives, Covid-19 and the Black Lives Matter movement are a screen “for pedophilia and human trafficking”.Another has claimed the US has a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles out”, while several others running for national office have posted cryptic memes hinting at a powerful global elite that must be abolished.These believers in QAnon, a conspiracy theory labelled a potential domestic terror threat by the FBI, are all running for national office – not as fringe independents, but as Republican candidates.In some cases they have been backed by Republican money, and promoted by Donald Trump himself, and in certain Republican heartland states, the QAnon candidates are even likely to be elected in November.Marjorie Taylor Greene, from Georgia, is among the QAnon supporters with the best chance of winning in November.

The extra weekly $600 payments to the unemployed during the Covid-19 pandemic expired on Friday night, causing fears that many will be plunged into poverty as a result. Democrats and Republicans have yet to reach a new deal on the matter.White House chief of staff Mark Meadows was on CBS’s Face the Nation and admitted a deal is some way off. He, along with treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin, met with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to discuss the deal on Saturday.“Yesterday was a step in the right direction. Our staffs are actually working today. We’ll be meeting again tomorrow. But I’m not optimistic that there will be a solution in the very near term,” he said during his appearance on CBS.He also denied that Donald Trump had looked into delaying the November election, despite the fact that the president floated the possibility of doing so earlier this week, to widespread criticism from Democrats and Republicans.“He has not looked at delaying any- any election,” said Meadows. “What we will do is if we try to transform this and start mailing in ballots all across the country, all 50 states, what we will see is a delay because they’re just not equipped to handle it.”There is no substantial evidence mail-in voting is subject to fraud, as Trump suggested when he spoke about delaying the election.

The Houston-based doctor and pastor said the drug can “stop Covid in its tracks in 30 days” but then again she also believes some women’s medical problems are caused by sex with “spirit husbands”. Donald Trump, who has touted hydroxychloroquine himself in the past, called Immanuel “impressive” earlier this week.During an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, Trump’s coronavirus testing tsar, Brett Giroir, said there is no evidence hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment for Covid-19.“I think most physicians and prescribers are evidence-based and they’re not influenced by whatever’s on Twitter or anything else and the evidence just doesn’t show that hydroxychloroquine is effective right now,” he said. “I think we need to move on from that and talk about what is effective.”US congresswoman Karen Bass has emerged as a frontrunner to be Joe Biden’s running mate in November, and she confirmed she is willing to take the job if offered.“I think anybody that is willing to become vice president, if they’re invited, should be ready and I think that I am,” Bass said during an appearance on Fox News Sunday.Bass is seen by some in the Biden camp as being less likely to clash with their man than another strong candidate, Kamala Harris. However, Bass and Biden differ on healthcare with the congresswoman in favour of “Medicare for all”. Biden believes private healthcare still has a big part to play in the US system. “No, I don’t think that the vice president is wrong at all,” Bass said when asked about the difference in their policies. “What I do believe in is that health care should be a right. I think that we should be like the rest of the industrial nations and provide health care. But what I believe specifically is that we need to repair the damage that was done and has been done over the last ten years to the Affordable Care Act. We need to repair the damage, we need to expand that, and then over time we need to figure as a nation, how do we make health care as a right for everyone.”Bass also said she had reconsidered a statement she made when Fidel Castro died in 2016, At the time, she described his death as a “great loss” for Cuba. Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth, a potential running mate for Joe Biden in November, has appeared on Fox News Sunday. She was asked if she was ready to step up and become president if needed. “I think any one of the women whose names have been mentioned being considered are fabulous women and well prepared to step up and do the job of vice president or step up and take over as president if needed,” she said. She also said that Trump has “failed to respond to this pandemic” as deaths from Covid-19 reach more than 155,000 in the US. Duckworth has criticized Trump’s decision to send federal agents to some US cities in response to anti-racism protests. She said the president should be concentrating on gun control rather than protesters if he wants to alleviate violence in US cities.“If President Trump truly wants to go after violence in our country, he should call Mitch McConnell right now and ask for a sensible vote on uniform background checks,” she said. “That is, let’s get rid of those gun show loopholes.” Arkansas’ Republican governor Asa Hutchinson has seen a rise in cases in his state over the last few weeks, but has denied that shutting down bars and restaurants will help curb that trend. “So far we have not seen any correlation between an increase in cases and lifting of restrictions,” he told CNN on Sunday morning. He added that wearing masks in public is vital “of course the most important about that is that people comply with it.”He was also asked about Donald Trump’s suggestion earlier this week that he may delay the November election over (unfounded) fears of mail-in voting fraud. “As everyone has indicated, there shouldn’t be any change in the date of the election ... It is constitutional. It is required,” said Hutchinson. “The president should accept the results just like presidents in the past have accepted the results.”More from Deborah Birx’s appearance on CNN. Covid-19 is seen by many as an urban disease that spreads in cities where people are crammed together, particularly after cities such as New York and Detroit were hit hard in the early stages of the pandemic. But Birx warned people in rural areas that Covid-19 is a danger for them too.“If you have high case load and active community spread, just like we are asking people not to go to bars, not to have household parties, not to create large spreading events, we are asking people to distance learn at this moment so we can get this epidemic under control,” Birx said.Donald Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller is on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace.He is asked about Trump trailing in the polls to Joe Biden. “We think we’re in a great shape,” he says as polls show Trump trailing to his presumptive opponent in several key battleground states. Miller says Trump is leading “or within the margin of error” in states he needs to win in November. He adds that Trump was down to Clinton in 2016 at a similar stage, and says public polling is “lagging behind” private polls conducted by the Trump campaign.He is then asked by Wallace if he will guarantee the Trump campaign will not accept information about Biden or his family from foreign officials or governments.He says that Wallace has asked a “silly question ... we’re going to beat Biden fair and square.” Wallace then asks Miller to give him a flat yes or no in regards to whether he would accept foreign information. “There is no foreign assistance in this campaign,” says Miller, not quite denying Wallace’s question. He also says Wallace should ask the same question to the Biden campaign. The interview ends with Wallace asking Miller about Trump’s suggestion earlier this week that he could delay November’s election.“The election is going to be on 3 November,” says Miller. He says it is actually Democrat governors who want the election delayed by introducing mail-in voting, where ballots can arrive after 3 November.House speaker Nancy Pelosi turned her attention to Deborah Birx on ABC’s This Week, and didn’t exactly give her a ringing endorsement.Birx, , meanwhile, was asked about Pelosi’s comments when she appeared on CNN on Sunday morning. Birx said she believed Pelosi was referring to an article in the New York Times that depicted her as being too optimistic about the fight against the virus. “This was not a pollyannish view. I’ve never been called pollyannish, or non-scientific, or non-data driven,” Birx said. “I will stake my 40-year career on those fundamental principles of using data to implement better programs and save lives.”Reports earlier this week said Pelosi criticized Birx in a meeting with treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. “Deborah Birx is the worst. Wow, what horrible hands you’re in,” Pelosi said according to Politico.Pelosi is also to said to have described infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci, who has been sidelined by the White House, as a “hero”. Dr Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, has appeared on CNN’s State of the Union. She said that Covid-19 has taken a hold over large parts of the US, and is no longer restricted to large cities as was the trend in the early stages of the pandemic. “What we are seeing today is different from March and April. It is extraordinarily widespread. It’s into the rural as equal urban areas,” Birx said.She also warned people who have been to areas hit hard by the disease, such as Florida, to “assume you’re infected.”Birx said she had been to 14 states in the last three weeks as part of her job, and had witnessed how Americans are continuing to travel across the country, potentially spreading the virus. “I can tell you across America right now, people are on the move,” she said.More than 150,000 people have died in America due to Covid-19. According to Yahoo News, the Centers for Disease Control forecast earlier this week that the death toll could rise as high as 182,000 by 22 August.Good morning. The main news is that Republicans have decided the press will be barred when Donald Trump is formally declared the party’s nominee for president later this month. “We are happy to let you know if this changes, but we are working within the parameters set before us by state and local guidelines regarding the number of people who can attend events.”The Associated Press’s White House correspondent, Zeke Miller, has called the decision “ill-advised”, while veteran CNN host Wolf Blitzer called the decision to bar the press from a major part of the country’s democratic process “unthinkable”. In a sign that the backlash may have got to the GOP, Miller later reported that “the decision is not final and that they are still working through press coverage options. Hopefully they’ll give the American people the access they deserve.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e26cde8df08b9792d919d34f3d5614d0fee5391d/0_99_2773_1663/master/2773.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=586a750f92217e2302089afd6c906800","title":"perverse vulnerable coronairus shielding age uk","story":"Charity says government advice at odds with decision to postpone lockdown easing in EnglandEnding support for extremely vulnerable people shielding from coronavirus while pausing the easing of lockdown restrictions in England has been described by a leading charity as “perverse”. Age UK has said it no longer makes sense to end the advice for vulnerable people to stay at home, since rising infection rates led to additional lockdown restrictions in parts of northern England and the pausing of further easing in the rest of the country.As of Saturday, more than 2 million people who are extremely clinically vulnerable to coronavirus are no longer being advised by governments in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland to stay at home, or shield. Many people have expressed concern that they feel forced to return to the workplace even though they do not think it is safe and the virus is still circulating in communities.Caroline Abrahams, director at Age UK, said: “With a number of lockdown easements firmly on hold and millions under new restrictions in the north it seems perverse for shielding, and the supports it brings, to be paused as of today.“There might have been a rationale for this pause when it was originally announced, a couple of weeks ago, but surely not now. Many shielding older workers, for example, are likely to be feeling distinctly nervous if they are required by their employer to return to their workplace on Monday.”She added: “As the government is toughening up precautions to arrest the spread of the virus it seems only fair that they also continue to recognise and meet the support needs of those at greatest clinical risk.”Those with serious illness such as blood cancers and severe asthma, as well as those on immunosuppressant medication, were ordered to shield from 23 March, initially for a period of 12 weeks.Shielding advice remains in place in Blackburn with Darwen, parts of Leicester and Luton. In Wales, shielding is expected to end on 16 August.Leading scientists were among those to express concern this week that shielding might be ending too soon. The Trades Union Congress is asking employers not to force the return of their staff and instead to continue using the government’s job retention scheme for shielding workers, which runs until October. It is also calling for this to be extended for people who are told by their doctor that they should shield for longer.Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said it was critical that the safety net put in place for those shielding did not simply “disappear” as it was a lifeline for clinically vulnerable people.The Health and Safety Executive has said every effort should be made to help shielding workers do their jobs from home, but many teachers, shop workers, library staff and warehouse workers cannot do their jobs remotely.The government has said employers must ensure the safety of anyone with a long-term condition or a rare disease when considering working arrangements, “including whether work can be completed remotely and that workplaces are Covid-secure”. If clinically extremely vulnerable people cannot work from home, the government is advising that they be offered the safest available on-site job. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Our shielding guidance is based on the latest clinical advice.“As average incidence rates across the country remain sufficiently low, we do not want to advise anyone to follow these measures for longer than is necessary.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a7226ea6b6b827a30b07c0840601fc165486981/0_49_962_577/master/962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ade7141f5164bb3afa74e4211d4c88e","title":"pubs england close control coronavirus adviser graham medley","story":"The government may have to consider closing pubs in England to control the transmission of the coronavirus and to enable schools to reopen after the summer holidays, one of its top scientific advisers has said.Prof Graham Medley, who chairs the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) sub-group on pandemic modelling, said reopening schools was a priority for the wellbeing of children and that some other activities might have to stop to control the infection rate.The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine academic told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think we’re in a situation whereby most people think that opening schools is a priority for the health and wellbeing of children and that when we do that we are going to reconnect lots of households.“And so actually, closing some of the other networks, some of the other activities may well be required to enable us to open schools. It might come down to a question of which do you trade off against each other and then that’s a matter of prioritising, do we think pubs are more important than schools?”Boris Johnson raised the threat on Friday of a second national lockdown as he paused new freedoms scheduled this weekend amid fears that any further reopening of the economy could trigger a full-blown resurgence of the virus. Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, said the UK had “probably reached near the limit of what we can do” if the virus was to be kept under control.Medley said the increased lockdown measures in areas across the north-west of England introduced on Thursday night were “highly unlikely” to be the final regional intervention.He said the rise in coronavirus infections appeared to be among younger people but there was a danger it could “spill” over into other parts of the population.“The age distribution of infections has changed, it has moved down into younger age groups and so it is likely we won’t see that increase in hospital admissions related to infection in the same way we did in March,” he said. “But the big fear is the virus just gets out of control and we end up in a situation where there is so much virus that it inevitably spills out into all sections of the population.”Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest that infection rates in England are rising, with about 4,200 new cases of coronavirus a day, compared with an estimated 2,800 a week ago. However, this increase is thought to be far below levels seen during the pandemic’s peak.It has emerged that Sage considered a paper in early July, just before the pubs reopened, warning that the possibility of serious disorder in the coming months could “overwhelm all attempts” to control coronavirus and “catastrophically” undermine recovery plans.“Put simply, a serious deterioration of public order could overwhelm all attempts to control contagion, overwhelm hospitals, the criminal justice system and hinder revival of the economy.”The research, prepared by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B) policing and security sub-group, described a “volatile and highly complex situation” in which tensions resulting from the pandemic have become “inextricably bound” with structural inequalities and international events.The authors cited the Black Lives Matter movement and an increasing sense of “racial injustice, inequality and discrimination” felt among black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities, which have been disproportionately affected by the virus.At the same time, the authors said extreme rightwing groups are mobilising at a scale not seen for a decade, and exploiting fatal stabbing incidents in Reading, London and Glasgow. Any serious public disorder that developed would be likely to require military involvement, they said.Large-scale protests, celebrations and unlicensed music events have been increasing, as public health messaging became less clear, the authors added in the paper titled, Public Disorder and Public Health: Contemporary Threats and Risks.The scapegoating of various communities, and a sense of inequality or grievance due to localised lockdowns, could also stoke flames, they warned.“There is already a view among London’s black community that large gatherings on beaches, or outside Anfield, involving predominantly white and older communities, largely see no police intervention of scale,” the report read.“In contrast, large gatherings in streets or parks with music and dancing with predominantly BAME communities or young people result in police intervention.”On Friday, the prime minister did not distance himself from remarks by a Tory MP claiming the “vast majority” of people breaching coronavirus lockdown rules were from BAME communities, particularly those from Muslim backgrounds. He said only that it was “up to the whole country to get this right”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7a9cb7f75b7d3ec53b86b2042dc14e0981279bd/576_721_4177_2506/master/4177.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=924a9b2f162c50166ea9cfc2d37e187c","title":"an incoherent approach to controlling covid 19","story":"The recent spikes in infections would have been entirely preventable if a proper test-and-trace system had been in place, writes Philip Barber. Plus letters from Bernie Evans, Karin Koller and Martin Redfern The recent approach to controlling Covid-19 transmission in England seems particularly boneheaded: the recent local “spikes” were entirely preventable by a proper system of testing, tracking and tracing, identifying contacts of inidual cases and locking them down this system is just not in place, and no macro-statistic of total tests undertaken will substitute for it. This is what “local measures” should mean, not targeting huge swathes of the urban population.Second, the measures recently adopted are incoherent to the point of absurdity – I can go out with friends for dinner, but not visit my mother? The danger here is lack of credibility, exacerbated by a complete inability to enforce such parochial restrictions.Third, the current family distancing is likely to have a disproportionate effect on morale. We still desperately need a robust testing and tracing system, administered through general practice and local public health services, not the over-centralised, ineffective (and privatised) testing stations we currently rely on. We need not just tests but a coordinated testing system with fully shared information, based on a firm target of zero transmission. The government just doesn’t get it. Philip Barber Consultant respiratory physician, Manchester• The “premature rush”, as your editorial (31 July) states, to relax the lockdown rules is the “real problem”, not the “tightening of restrictions”, but there is one other unmentioned factor also causing so many lives to be endangered. By claiming that there are signs of a second wave of the pandemic in Europe, and that it could possibly spread to the UK, Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings are giving the false impression that the first wave here is under control. With “one in 1,500 people” now having Covid-19, it is clear that it is not, and failing to admit it is another reason for trust in this administration to decrease.Informing the public of the true situation would improve positive reaction to government announcements, and make a resurgence of coronavirus less likely. It would also entail, however, an admission of failure through wrong or belated decisions, so will not happen. Instead there is now a “whiff of the government blaming the public” for failing to follow the guidance and yet more criticism of European countries. Accepting responsibility and admitting culpability are clearly not in the Cummings handbook for advising prime ministers attributing deaths to a second wave from Europe evidently is. Bernie Evans Liverpool• Please can Boris Johnson’s government listen to Professor Devi Sridhar (The northern lockdown represents government failure. There is a better way, 31 July). Everything she has ever written, said or tweeted about the current pandemic makes total sense. She is an expert adviser to the devolved Scottish government and the main reason Scotland is pursuing a “zero Covid” approach, with impressive results. She is a terrific communicator too. Karin Koller Leicester• In a rare display of common purpose, Andy Burnham, Nicola Sturgeon and Matt Hancock all supported tighter restrictions on mobility and socialising in the Greater Manchester area. In the background, party politicians as ever continue puerile point scoring over the virus, but I can’t help wondering if this (probably short-lived) consensual approach had been adopted by all political parties across the UK in March, could Covid-19’s terrible impact have been mitigated?

Some that were less affected in the earliest weeks are now seeing escalating numbers of cases and deaths.”Mexico, which like many countries has lifted tight restrictions imposed earlier this year, reported a record 9,556 new cases on Saturday. It also announced 784 additional fatalities, bringing its total to 47,472 deaths.An emergency WHO committee reviewing the pandemic noted the “anticipated lengthy duration of this Covid-19 outbreak” required a sustained response, according to a statement from the UN body released on Saturday.It said nuanced, pragmatic guidance was needed to reduce the risk of response fatigue in the context of socioeconomic pressures.There have been almost 17.8m confirmed cases around the world and more than 684,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.South Africa, which gradually loosened a strict lockdown imposed at the end of March, reported it had counted more than half a million cases at the weekend. The country is by far the hardest-hit in Africa and accounts for more than half of diagnosed infections.Meanwhile, India reported nearly 55,000 new coronavirus cases, down from the previous day’s record 57,118 but raising the country’s total to 1.75m. The month of July accounted for more than 1.1m of those cases.The country’s interior minister, Amit Shah, said on Sunday he had tested positive for coronavirus and had been admitted to hospital. Shah, a close aide to Narendra Modi, the prime minister, heads a key ministry that has been at the forefront of managing India’s coronavirus outbreak.The Australian state of Victoria has declared a state of disaster and placed Melbourne, the country’s second-biggest city, under night-time curfew as it grapples with hundreds of “mystery cases” of coronavirus.Under the six-week so-called stage 4 lockdown, no one will be allowed to venture further than 5km (3.1 miles) from their home, only one person per household per day will be allowed to go shopping, and only one hour of exercise will be permitted.Seven health officials from China were due to arrive in Hong Kong on Sunday, the first members of a 60-person team that will carry out widespread testing for Covid-19 in the territory as it races to halt a third wave of the illness.In the Philippines, infections surged past 100,000 on Sunday, after medical groups declared that the country was waging a losing battle against the virus and asked the president to reimpose a lockdown in the capital.The country has the second-highest number of cases in south-east Asia after Indonesia and has had more infections than China, where the pandemic began late last year.President Rodrigo Duterte eased a severe virus lockdown in the capital, Manila, a city of more than 12 million people on 1 June, after the economy shrank slightly in the first quarter, its first contraction in more than two decades.France and Spain, two countries that imposed stringent lockdowns earlier this year, have both also experienced recent surges in cases, while in the UK, Boris Johnson was reportedly considering new lockdown measures in England.In Israel, a steep rise in cases and the government’s bungled economic response has sparked increasingly large protests. On Saturday night, thousands of demonstrators gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv to call for the resignation of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who also faces corruption allegations.Agencies contributed to this report."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4e30d1377ff962a3e1b0ed9b4bd94323107d2f7/0_132_6100_3660/master/6100.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=25723144f4373ae0af2f16a7168a0e46","title":"is this the beginning of the end for europes last dictator","story":"Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus faces threats from all sides as the country decides whether to give him a sixth term as presidentAlexander Lukashenko is under pressure like never before. The past week has brought astonishing scenes in Belarus: an opposition rally hailed as the largest since the fall of the Soviet Union the arrest of 33 Russian mercenaries allegedly sent to destabilise the country and an admission from Lukashenko that after months of minimising the coronavirus epidemic, he had tested positive for the virus.It is likely that the president, who has held power for 25 years, will claim victory in the 9 August elections and remain the country’s leader. But he is on the defensive, facing an energised opposition amid bitter spats with Russia over economic integration, and with the west over human rights. It is the most precarious moment of his career.“For the first time, Lukashenko is fighting a war on three fronts,” said Alexander Feduta, a political analyst who served as an aide to Lukashenko in the 1990s. “He doesn’t know where to turn.” Even with a win in next Sunday’s vote, those battles will follow Lukashenko into his sixth term.Backed into a corner, the Belarusian leader has responded this week by visiting military bases and anti-riot troops, telling them that they “must not allow” street protests. State television has broadcast footage of water cannon and troops holding mock clashes with demonstrators.The message to the opposition was clear: think twice about challenging the election result. But the normal scare tactics have done little to dampen turnout at opposition rallies, which have attracted crowds in the thousands, even in smaller towns that usually deliver strong turnout for the incumbent president.“It’s all to scare Belarusians so that they don’t protest. But it’s not working,” said Feduta. “The more that he tries to scare them, the more it has a reverse effect… Right now, he is trying to convince everyone that he will open fire. If there’s no shooting, it’s him being weak. But if a shot is fired, it’s his political death.”Protests to challenge the results next week look inevitable. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the united opposition candidate, has told journalists that she won’t call for demonstrations but will join them if they break out. She agreed to run as a stand-in for her husband, Sergei Tikhanovsky, a popular YouTuber jailed by the authorities. Her campaign platform is simple: release political prisoners and arrange a new round of free and fair elections.Viktor Babariko, a jailed opposition candidate who is now barred from standing, said in an interview before his arrest that while he hoped people would eschew violence, the public was angry. “We saw how a deceived people dealt with Ceaușescu,” he said, referencing the swift demise of the Romanian dictator in the final few days of 1989.Opposition rallies are growing to unprecedented numbers. A rally in Minsk on 19 July attracted around 10,000 people. A rally in the same city 11 days later had an estimated attendance of 63,000 people, according to monitors from the human rights organisation Viasna, making it the largest demonstration since the fall of the Soviet Union.“You think that I’m not afraid? I’m afraid every day,” Tikhanovskaya told the crowd. “But I get up, summon my will, get over my fear and move forward.”In the absence of trustworthy polling, much of the evidence relies on crowd numbers and anecdotal evidence. Opposition leaders say that Lukashenko has lost a lot of support for his blasé remarks on the coronavirus pandemic and for simple exhaustion with his leadership.“There’s become a kind of personal dislike for him,” said Maria Kolesnikova, the head of Babariko’s aborted campaign, which has united behind Tikhanovskaya. “He was seen for a long time as the strong leader. And now he’s 65, and there’s a sense that it’s time for him to retire.”While Lukashenko could once often turn to Russia, a traditional ally, for backing, relations between the two countries have soured.The dispute centres on a Russian-led plan to further integrate the two countries’ economies. Lukashenko has accused his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, of putting economic pressure on him and later backing his opponents in the elections.In a sharp escalation of tensions this week, Belarus accused 33 Russian mercenaries who were detained near Minsk of preparing a terrorist attack to destabilise the country ahead of the election.Moscow has demanded the return of the men and toughened border checks between the two countries.Analysts said that Lukashenko is likely to release the men after the election, but for now will want to hold them to emphasise to the public the danger of an intervention from Moscow.“Lukashenko must show that if there are protests against his elections, then they’re being inspired by Russia,” said Feduta."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15167940d871cb35b6c34cf22188d282b62c1b1b/0_255_4242_2545/master/4242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8005aa7fd09afc8a8f794e3d0ab41159","title":"parthenon of shipwrecks greece opens its first underwater museum","story":"A wreck boasting a trove of fifth-century BC amphorae has been opened to ers off the island of AlonissosGreece has inaugurated its first underwater museum, a trove of fifth-century BC amphorae labelled the “Parthenon of shipwrecks”, off the coast of Alonissos island in the western Aegean.The site of the wreck will be open to tours by certified amateur ers from 3 August to 2 October, while those who can’t e can follow a virtual reality tour at an information centre in the main town of Alonissos.Culture minister Lina Mendoni along with other officials attended the ceremony on Saturday.“This wreck lies at 21-28 metres depth near the shores of the Peristera islet and contains 3,000 to 4,000 amphorae,” Maria Agalou, president of the municipal council of Alonissos, told Skai TV.The trove of two-handled vases is believed to be one of the most important of its kind because most of them are intact.

At least 40 passengers and crew from a luxury cruise liner have tested positive for Covid-19 and the authorities are still trying to trace a number of passengers from two recent Arctic voyages, public health officials in Norway said on Sunday. Four crew members on the MS Roald Amundsen were hospitalised on Friday when the ship arrived at the port of Tromsoe, and later diagnosed with the respiratory illness. Tests showed another 32 of the 158 staff were also infected, Reuters reports.While the crew was quarantined on the ship, the 178 passengers who arrived on Friday were allowed to disembark before anyone had been diagnosed, triggering a complex operation to locate them in order to contain any potential spread. So far, four of the combined 387 passengers travelling on the ship on two separate cruises since 17 July have been found to carry the virus, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) and the Tromsoe municipality said. “We expect that more infections will be found in connection to this outbreak,” said Line Vold, a senior FHI executive, adding that the passengers have been told so self-isolate. The Hurtigruten line, owner of the MS Roald Amundsen as well as 15 other vessels, became in mid-June the first to return an oceangoing cruise ship to service following a three-month halt due to the pandemic. Asked later on Sunday whether the authorities had by now located and tested everyone potentially infected aboard the cruise liner, an FHI spokesman said: “Messages have been sent to all the passengers. We’re now seeking to verify that the information has been received and understood.”Among the infected crew, 32 were from the Philippines while the rest were of Norwegian, French and German nationality, operator Hurtigruten said. A record high percentage of US companies are beating analysts’ forecasts this earnings season, giving investors a glimmer of hope in what is still expected to be the slowest profit period since the financial crisis. The latest big boost to numbers came late last week, when results from Facebook and trillion-dollar market value companies Apple, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet surpassed forecasts. In many cases, estimates had been lowered so much ahead of earnings season that they were easier to beat, strategists said. Still, the results bolster the case for investors betting that the impact of coronavirus-led lockdowns and layoffs on companies’ bottom lines may not be quite as dire as previously believed.“What it’s saying is there are pockets of absolute strength in corporate America,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. Tech results in particular suggested “there is spending going on globally,” she said. The Philippines said on Sunday it would reimpose a stricter lockdown in and around its capital for two weeks from midnight of 4 August, as the country struggles to contain coronavirus infections that have jumped to more than 100,000 cases. President Rodrigo Duterte has approved placing  Manila and nearby provinces such as Laguna, Cavite, Rizal and Bulacan under so-called “Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine” until 18 August, his spokesman Harry Roque told reporters, according to Reuters.The move followed a call on Saturday by 80 local groups representing 80,000 doctors and a million nurses for tighter controls saying the Philippines was losing the fight against the coronavirus and warning of a collapse in the healthcare system from soaring infections. The British government said 46,201 people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Saturday, up by eight from the day before. Separate figures published by the UK’s statistics agencies show there have now been 56,400 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. The government also said that in the 24-hour period up to 9am on Sunday, there had been a further 744 lab-confirmed cases. Overall, a total of 304,695 cases have been confirmed. The foreign ministers of longstanding regional foes Iran and the United Arab Emirates agreed on Sunday that they would strive to cooperate during the coronavirus pandemic, Reuters reports.In a video call during which they also exchanged greetings for the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan told his Iranian counterpart that strengthening bilateral cooperation was important element in tackling the coronavirus, UAE state news agency WAM said.Iran’s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a tweet that it was “a very substantive, frank and friendly video conversation” on Covid-19 as well as “bilateral, regional and global situations.” “We agreed to continue dialogue on theme of hope, especially as region faces tough challenges, and tougher choices ahead,” he wrote. Shi’ite Muslim Iran has long been at odds with the UAE and Saudi Arabia, two Sunni Arab US allies. Tensions between Iran and the United States have been on the rise since 2018, when US president Donald Trump withdrew from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with six powers and reimposed sanctions.Washington blamed a series of attacks against oil interests in the Gulf last year on Iran, while the UAE did not publicly hold a particular country responsible. The two ministers held a telephone call in March in which Sheikh Abdullah expressed the UAE’s support for Iran during the coronavirus outbreak. Bands of heavy rain from Isaias lashed Florida’s east coast on Sunday while officials dealing with surging cases of coronavirus kept a close watch on the weakened tropical storm, the Associated Press reports.Isaias was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm Saturday afternoon, but was still expected to bring heavy rain and flooding as it crawled just off Florida’s Atlantic coast.“Don’t be fooled by the downgrade,” Florida Governor Ron DeSantis warned at a news conference after the storm spent hours roughing up the Bahamas.“It’s a tale of two storms,” said Stacy Stewart, senior hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami on Sunday. “If you live on the west side of the storm, you didn’t get much. If you live east of the storm, there’s a lot of nasty weather there.”Florida is on the west side of Isaias.Authorities closed beaches, parks and virus testing sites, lashing signs to palm trees so they wouldn’t blow away. DeSantis said the state is anticipating power outages and asked residents to have a week’s supply of water, food and medicine on hand. Officials wrestled with how to prepare shelters where people can seek refuge from the storm if necessary, while also safely social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus.Isaias put another burden on communities already hit by other storms and sickness.In Palm Beach County, about 150 people were in shelters, said emergency management spokeswoman Lisa De La Rionda, adding that the evacuees are physically distant from each other and wearing masks, due to the virus.In Indian River County, north of West Palm Beach, Florida, emergency shelters were clearing out Sunday after Isaias was downgraded to a tropical storm.Officials told TCPalm newspapers that 38 people registered at three schools used as shelters. Those areas now must be cleaned to ensure no traces of the coronavirus remain as teachers and staff report Monday to prepare for the upcoming school year.No one checked in with Covid-19 symptoms.Temperature checks were done at the door, officials said, and isolation rooms were designated in case anyone came in with symptoms.Hello, I’m taking over from my colleague Ben, as always, please don’t hesitate to get in touch if you have relevant tips and pointers to share, you can get me on Twitter @JedySays or via email.Why has the UK done so badly when it comes to having the most excess deaths in Europe from Covid 19? There are no simple answers but one hint may be given by an interactive map provided by an official statistical report last week, which shows the development of excess mortality at a local level across Europe. That’s according to Prof David Spiegelhalter, a statistician who earlier this year asked the UK government to stop using an article he wrote for the  as justification for why Britain’s death toll from coronavirus should not be compared with that of other countries.In a new piece for the  today, he writes:We see strong hotspots in northern Italy and central Spain, which stay fairly localised – for example, Rome has seen no excess mortality. But it is genuinely chilling to see these extra deaths erupt fairly evenly across the whole of the UK, as the thousands of people returning from winter holidays in Spain and Italy seeded hundreds of separate outbreaks across the country. The epidemic in the UK was more widespread and went on longer than in other countries, which saw their mortality return to normal levels by May, while the UK’s excess continued well into June.Forty-five police officers were injured in a wave of weekend demonstrations in Berlin including protests against coronavirus restrictions, police said as protesters gathered again in smaller numbers on Sunday.The protests, in which many demonstrators failed to wear masks or respect social distancing rules, have sparked a chorus of condemnation including calls for tougher penalties against those who violate restrictions aimed at curbing transmission of the deadly virus.A total of 133 people were arrested during Saturday’s protests, which included a huge “day of freedom” demo against coronavirus restrictions, police said in a statement on Sunday.The arrests were for offences including resisting police officers, breach of the peace and the use of unconstitutional symbols. Three officers required hospital treatment, police said.A further five people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals to 29,347, NHS England said.Patients were aged between 52 and 86 years old, and all had known underlying health conditions. A further two deaths were reported with no positive Covid-19 test result.In Wales, authorities have said a further three people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths in the country to 1,565.The number of cases in Wales increased by 37, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 17,279.Scotland has recorded its seventeenth day without any new registered coronavirus deaths, as authorities reported 31 new cases.It brings the total number of positive cases to 18,676, according to figures released in the last hour."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"National agenda derailed by judgment, but Minister notes decision key to political focusDecision a reminder that failure on climate commitments is actionable in court of lawCoalition will have to devise new plan following ruling of seven-judge court"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Inidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping change"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photo: Stephen Collins Collins Photos DublinRandom testing will be introduced at Irish airports to help boost the fight against Covid-19, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has said.A timeframe for the introduction of such checks has yet to be announced, however, as the Cabinet has yet to sign off on the plan.It is one of a number of issues to be discussed as part of ongoing measures to deal with the coronavirus pandemic when the Coalition decides whether to further ease social restrictions on August 10th.The Cabinet is also awaiting NPHET’s recommendation before deciding on whether to allow the re-opening of pubs that do not serve food.On Sunday, the Minister said “the number one focus is getting the schools reopened”.Speaking on RTÉ Radio at lunchtime, he added “decisions could be made if NPHET deem them necessary in order to keep the opening of schools on track”.On international travel, he said: “We’re introducing random testing at the airports and an increased public health presence and we’re examining other options for further restrictions on non-essential travel because... the international situation is becoming more volatile”.He said that even in Spain, Belgium, Germany, France and parts of England “it is a very serious situation”.Proposals for random testing at ports and airports were among a number of related issues discussed at a Cabinet meeting on July 21st.Details of how the measure will be introduced, the number of tests to be carried out each day and if flights from particular countries would be targeted are expected to be clarified following the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.Mr Donnelly said Ireland had “the most restrictive and green list of any country in the EU, which is helping obviously”.While he welcomed the move on random testing, he said his party had called for a number of measures to be implemented including “mandatory temperature screening and wearing of facemasks in airports”, a requirement for all passengers to download the Covid-19 Contact Tracing App, and random testing of a proportion of incoming passengers from “green list” countries.“In addition, we called for all visitors arriving from high-risk ‘red list’ areas should be required to pay for their Covid-19 testing and accommodation at designated isolation facilities, and only be permitted to enter the state after the isolation period has passed, or two negative Covid-19 tests have been recorded,” Mr Cullinane said.Uncertainty over pubsOn the movement towards phase four of the reopening plan, Mr Donnelly said publicans asked a “very fair question” as to why they were being single out” because retail and other sections of business were open.But public health officials had said international experience showed that when pubs reopened the number of new cases went up.“It did not seem to be the case with restaurants, for example, which is why they advise the restaurants could open... with the restrictions in place.”He noted 90 per cent of cases were an “entirely domestic situation” and not from overseas travel.The Covid-tracing app had been downloaded by 1.5 million people and was making a big difference, the North and launched their app and the two governments were working to ensure that information in terms of contact tracing would be shared.They were also bulking up the team that chases passengers through the locator form which is going online.Mr Donnelly said there had been significant clusters in the midlands, including factory outbreaks in Kildare, with one factory closed as a result, as well as direct provision outbreaks in Kildare and Laois.“We’re looking at an outbreak in Clare and a new cluster in Limerick.”He said what concerned public health doctors more is community transmission, where “people are coming forward, are testing positive and we don’t know where they contracted the disease”.The Cabinet’s decision on whether phase four can start on August 10th is due on Tuesday.Under phase four of the reopening roadmap, pubs that do not serve food would be allowed to reopen and gatherings of up to 100 people indoors and 500 outdoors would be permitted.The Licensed Vintners Association (LVA) said the Government’s decision to wait until next week to decide whether pubs should reopen the following Monday was “deeply unhelpful” and “adding real stress” to publicans and staff.Donall O’Keefe, chief executive of the LVA, which represents publicans in Dublin, said by August 10th pubs would have had “no income” for just under 150 days, which is more than 40 per cent of the year."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoNumber one focus is getting the schools reopened,\u0026rsquo says DonnellyOver 90 per cent of cases reported on Sunday had been identified,

Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords. Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGettyConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords.Lord Kerr, the architect of article 50 which enabled the UK to exit the EU, has warned that the special arrangements put in place to avoid a border on the island of Ireland may be a fatal trade barrier for some companies.Under the Northern Ireland protocol, all businesses sending goods to the region from Great Britain will have to make formal declarations for the first time, with food sellers such as supermarkets subject to separate checks on chilled and fresh food from January.“How confident are you that GB businesses are just not going to write off the Northern Ireland market?” he asked the Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker who was appearing before the Lords EU committee.Just three weeks ago the first details of the new trading conditions across the Irish Sea emerged, with businesses obliged to complete three rounds of customs, security and transit forms on all goods being transported to Northern Ireland.Mr Walker said the government intended the new system to be “light touch” and streamlined.However, he faced further questions about the government’s preparedness with Lord Teverson questioning whether the new IT system, the Goods Vehicle Movement System, would be tested in time.And the former Conservative chancellor Lord Lamont challenged Boris Johnson’s repeated assertion that Northern Ireland businesses would continue to enjoy “unfettered access” to Great British markets.Lord Lamont argued there was a clear conflict in the Brexit protocol between article 5, which demands Northern Ireland businesses complete exit summary declarations for all goods being transported to the rest of the UK, and article 6, which promises “unfettered access”.“That is a rather awkward thing,” he told Mr Walker as he defended the government position, saying it was within the UK’s gift to ensure unfettered access.Mr Walker conceded that some of the detail of the protocol had yet to be agreed by the joint committee chaired by Michael Gove and the vice-president of the European Commission, Maroš Šefcovic.He also said details on the Northern Ireland border operating model, expected yesterday, would be published in the “coming weeks”. - "},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Infections surge in Latin America while China reports highest total since MarchPro-democracy opposition, which was seeking a majority, says move politically motivatedCountry records first Covid death after finding virus lurking in tourist city of DanangInternational lawmakers condemn move as \u0026lsquounacceptable obstructions of democratic process\u0026rsquoAustralian state reports daily record of 723 new infections as PM calls for patienceNajib convicted of all seven charges in first trial linked to multibillion dollar scandalHarry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleGood-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesExperts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasThere is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlRecord 10 deaths confirmed as Victoria\u0026rsquos second wave is driven by workplace spreadLockdown declared in border town as \u0026lsquorunaway\u0026rsquo returns from South - state media\u0026lsquoWhy are they playing Radiohead?

Photograph: Cristobal Herrera-UlashkevichEPA Isaias, downgraded from a hurricane but still a powerful tropical storm, moved along Florida’s eastern coast on Sunday, bringing strong winds but no longer posing a storm surge threat.The storm is forecast to move upward along the US east coast and reach Washington, Philadelphia and New York City on Tuesday before moving into New England. On Sunday Tropical Storm Isaias was about 90km southeast of Fort Pierce, Florida, heading northwest with top sustained winds of 100kmh, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.On its current path, on Monday and Tuesday its centre would move from off the coast of Georgia into the southern mid-Atlantic states. Little change was expected in the storm’s strength in the next couple of days, the NHC said.The Palm Beach area, where US president Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort is located, emerged largely unscathed from the storm after it brushed off its coast, with authorities reporting no widespread damage and no flooding.“We still are experiencing some winds,” Lisa DeLaRionda, a spokeswoman for Palm Beach County said on Sunday. “However, based on the latest forecast, those winds should be dying down early afternoon.”Although it appeared that Isaias’s impact on Florida would not be severe, the storm provided local emergency management with a “real-world scenario” of what extreme weather preparation and response could look like in the midst of a public health emergency as the states battles the coronavirus pandemic, Ms DeLaRionda said.The NHC discontinued a storm surge watch for Florida on Sunday, but warned that the South and North Carolina coast could still be hit by storm surges – when a storm pushes tidal levels above normal – of up to 1.2m. A tropical storm warning was issued for both states.Isaias was not expected to affect the return home on Sunday of two Nasa astronauts who travelled to the International Space Station aboard SpaceX’s new Crew Dragon.They were heading for a splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, off Florida’s northwest coast, capping a two-month voyage in space that marked Nasa’s first crewed mission from home soil in nine years.Isaias caused at least two deaths in the Dominican Republic and knocked out power for thousands of homes and businesses in Puerto Rico, according to media reports. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"meghans friends reluctant give evidence support","story":"The Duchess of Sussex may not receive the vital support of her friends as witnesses in her court battle over claims that her privacy was breached, it has emerged.Lawyers for Meghan have said it would be “an unacceptably high price” for the Duchess to be forced to identify the friends in pursuit of her legal claim against the Mail on Sunday (MoS) and that it would be a “cruel irony” should she be required to pay it.She is arguing that naming them would breach their privacy under the European Convention on Human Rights, while the newspaper argues that they must be disclosed as a key principle of open justice.But it is claimed that the prospect of being named in court - as normal procedure would require - has left them reluctant to take the witness stand voluntarily on Meghan\u0027s behalf.Documents submitted to the court by the Duchess’s legal team state: “It is not certain that the friends will be witnesses at the trial of this claim and the Court cannot be required to second-guess the result of any application for anonymity.”Describing the friends as innocent third parties, the Duchess’s lawyers go on to state that they “are not parties to this action but unwilling participants.”“On her case, which will be tried in due course, the Defendant has been guilty of a flagrant and unjustified intrusion into her private and family life. Given the close factual nexus between the Letter and the events leading up to the Defendant’s decision to publish its contents, it would be a cruel irony were she required to pay that price before her claim has even been determined.”The Duchess has applied for an order on behalf of the five that their names remain confidential, as part of her battle with the paper and it’s publishers, Associated Newspapers, but there is no certainty this will be granted by the trial judge, Mr Justice Warby.The five – who can be identified only by the initials A to E, but are all described as “young mothers”– gave briefings to People magazine, a US publication, last February.At the time Meghan was heavily pregnant, vulnerable and being subjected to what she claims was bullying by parts of the media.People revealed the existence of a letter to her father which was subsequently published in MoS, prompting the ongoing High Court action for breach of privacy and copyright.Justin Rushbrooke QC, barrister for the Duchess, told the High Court that she had been forced to identify her friends in a legal request by Associated Newspapers and added that the five were entitled to a very high level of super-charged right of confidentiality.Antony White QC, representing Associated Newspapers, told the court: The five iniduals have already been identified, not under compulsion but as part of the response to the request for further information. The question is not should their identities be disclosed – that has happened – it is should they be anonymised in these proceedings?In an embarrassing moment during the application Mr Rushbrooke accidentally let slip the surname of one of the five.Mr Justice Warby, who is expected to rule on the matter in August, immediately directed that the inidual\u0027s name was not to be reported.It was disclosed earlier that the Duchess had agreed to pay in full £67,888 in costs  to Associated Newspapers after the publisher successfully argued that elements of her case be struck out - a fraction of a multi-million legal bill which is expected should the case go to a full trial next year.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown north england rash decision not backed data oxford","story":"Imposing a widespread regional lockdown in the north west was a ‘rash’ decision which is not backed up by the data, an Oxford professor has claimed.People in Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire were banned from meeting different households indoors, in a move that Matt Hancock, the health secretary said was ‘absolutely necessary.’But Professor Carl Henegehan, director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford said the figures were skewed by delayed test results and when plotted by the date the test was taken showed no overall alarming rise.“The northern lockdown was a rash decision,” he said. “Where’s the rise? By date of test through July there’s no change if you factor in all the increased testing that’s going on.“As areas are tested, like Oldham, then there’s a slight rise in detected cases, asymptomatics. “It’s not clear  if these are false positives, or if these folk have viable virus or just RNA  fragments detected by a test threshold that picks up minute traces of RNA.“While you get these small clusters, which will have been occurring for some  time, they have not led to an overall increase in cases“The government needs to allow the local public health teams to do their job when localised clusters emerge.”Mapping the coronavirus trend by result date appears to show a slight increase in cases over the past few weeks, but based on specimen date - a more reliable measure - cases appear to have plateaued and may even be falling.Between July 22 and July 29 the seven day rolling average of reported cases jumped between those two dates from 659 to 753 - 16.7 per cent. However when judged by specimen date the seven day rolling average actually dropped from 641 to 442, a 31 per cent decrease.Any rise is also being skewed by a general increase in testing. The seven-day rolling average for tests carried out between July 22 and July 29 jumped from 137,427 to 153,252 - an 11.5 per cent increase, wiping out much of the increase.“Why is no one checking this out at government level?,” added Prof Heneghan“The specimen date is more reliable as the reporting data will be skewed by the delay in pillar 2 testing reporting.”At a press conference on Friday, shown above, Boris Johnson also said that the government had been swayed by Office for National Statistics data (ONS) which showed a ‘slight increase The ONS estimated that 35,700 people in England were infected with Covid-19 between July 20 and July 26, or 1 in 1,500 people. The week before statisticians had calculated around 27,700 were infected, or about 1 in 2,000. However the new calculation was based on just 59 people testing positive out of 116,026 swab tests (0.05 per cent). The previous week just 45 people tested positive out of 114,674. (0.39 per cent). It means that statisticians have extrapolated data for a whole country based on just 14 extra positive tests. The ONS also admitted that it was unable to spot any concrete regional differences. In fact, its modelling showed the north west as having one of the lowest incidences of Covid-19, while suggesting cases were rising in the East Midlands and London.Public Health England’s (PHE) own surveillance based on positive tests reported that cases in England increased from 4,062 to 4,130 in the week ending July 26 - a rise of just 1.6 per cent. According to ONS figures the rise was closer to 28 per cent. PHE data also showed that cases were already falling when many areas were locked down, including Blackburn, Rochdale, Kirklees and Rossendale. Professor Sheila Bird, Formerly Programme Leader, MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge, said that while the ONS data was ‘alerting’ it may not result in more serious cases or admissions to hospital.“Some of the newly swab-test positive infections in the ONS Infection Survey will never become symptomatic – and likewise a similar proportion of the 3200 new infections daily in the community in England.“These asymptomatic infected persons are capable of transmitting the virus.“We need to know more about the demography (age, sex, ethnicity) of the newly infected persons in the ONS Infection Survey as disease progression and hence hospital admission are less likely for younger infectees.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"masks normalised become subservient","story":"Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water – or rather into the museums, galleries, cinemas and places of worship where we seek our pleasures sacred and profane – the Government has announced that face-coverings will be mandatory in these spaces, as they are in shops, banks, takeaways and post offices. (The last one makes me wonder how easy life must be for hold-up artists now that it’s normal to roam the streets in a mask.)It is bitterly ironic that the most hail-fellow-well-met of Prime Ministers should now be overseeing the isolation of the nation you could tell it hurt this inveterate table-hopper at the banquet of life to say “I don’t want to tell people to spend less time with their friends. But unless people follow the rules and behave safely, we may need to go further. This is how we will avoid a return to full national lockdown.”Masks come with a whole bunch of exciting associations, from superheroes for the kiddies to exotic, erotic gatherings for the grown-ups. But when they’re forced on us, all the fun gets sucked out. Both Mammon-wise and morally, I believe they’ll be bad for the nation’s morale. Getting the retail section going again? Forget it. The only reason people still go shopping in the age of Amazon is as a social occasion. “Retail therapy” was never really about buying things except for the emptiest of us, but as a way of being with friends, drifting around like we still had all the time in the world, trying on possibilities. In masks, all we feel is our limits, and it doesn’t make us generous.But that’s a trivial matter compared to the damage a masked society will inflict on those with concerns more pressing than trying out lipstick testers. Masks are manna from heaven for the Worried Well who fuss about their banal anxieties while disregarding those with real disabilities for whom masking will make life a whole lot worse.Around one in six are thought to use lip-reading to make sense of the world during one radio phone-in I heard the mother of a deaf child explaining how sad it is for her lip-reading daughter to see everyone wearing masks “She was such a chatty little girl and now she’s just completely silent in public. It’s heartbreaking.” At least 10 schools have made coverings mandatory for pupils and teachers, prompting an inevitable battle with parents like Molly Kingsley, co-founder of the campaign group UsforThem, who told this newspaper “Based on the anger we have seen … there is a very visceral reaction among parents to face masks in schools.”On the radio I heard the mother of a boy with additional needs “He’s terrified of masks. He’s already lonely. He’ll be an outcast if masks are mandatory.” We are told that masking-up shows that we care, but treating our fellow human beings as germ-spreading units is not my idea of kindness.And as for the practicalities! When the PM promised “a greater police presence to ensure face coverings are being worn” I certainly hope the manpower will come from a new ision – the Toytown Police, perhaps – not from the current force who seem powerless in the face of cities running red with the blood of our youth. The idea of jails being emptied of violent criminals in order to make way for incorrigible Bare Faces is like something from a dystopian novel, back when there was still a market for them, before life imitated art.Of the many totalitarian hellholes in the world, some specialise in suppressing women with face-coverings, while others are equal opportunity oppressors. The poor beaten-down people of Islamist Iran and Communist China must cover their faces and know their place. There’s something extremely anti-human about forced masking, which is why the PM in an earlier, carefree incarnation triggered such a fierce backlash for his remarks about the Islamist mode of female garb.“Fame is a mask that eats the face” goes the old saying – but so is fear. If masking is normalised, we will soon become subservient creatures, government-licensed gimps. I’ll try not to shame those who embrace their masks as scared sheep – but only so long as we who resist aren’t demonised as murderous wolves.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"norilsk dispatch chemicals seep water courses russias arctic","story":"A rusty pipe churns out water along crimson banks of inches and inches of ore pulp near a power station in Russia’s Norilsk.There are no emergency workers or clean-up teams to deal with what looks and smells like an environmental disaster: in the factory town of Norilsk, industrial pollution has become so brazen and mundane that it took a spill of 21,000 tonnes of diesel fuel for the Kremlin to pay attention.“They’ve been dumping waste all around,” says Vasily Ryabinin, Norilsk’s ex-deputy chief environmental inspector, who says that he blew the whistle on his superiors for barring him from documenting the scale of the spill.“No one would admit to it but everyone in town knows about it.”On a rare trip to Norilsk, which is mostly off limits to foreigners, The Daily  documented three major sites where trees and vegetation have been annihilated by long-term dumping of industrial waste.Norilsk is rated the world’s single biggest emitter of sulfur dioxide.Two-hundred kilometres above the Arctic circle in Siberia, it was founded by Gulag prisoners during Josef Stalin’s reign of terror, and the climate here is so brutal that during 45 days of winter’s polar night the sun never goes up over the barren tundra, and patches of snow can still be seen in mid-July.Nornickel, a London-traded metals giant co-owned by billionaire Vladimir Potanin, controls Norilsk’s entire production cluster including dozens of facilities, from mining to smelting and refining.Clouds of sulfur dioxide from the chimneys of the copper plant routinely hang over blocks of flats less than two kilometres away.The white gas is so toxic that standing for seconds by the plant’s main gate makes you cough.Accustomed to environmental calamity, locals were stunned when a giant tank at a local power plant collapsed at the end of May, churning out about 21,000 tons of diesel fuel into the open.A few days after he filmed a local river bubble with crimson water reeking of diesel, Mr Ryabinin, a 39-year-old environmental inspector, put on his best suit and recorded a YouTube video to accuse the government of a cover-up.“I can’t sleep at night,” a visibly nervous Mr Ryabinin said in the video filmed at a friend’s home. “It’s a crime against our children, our grandchildren, against all human life.”A chemist by training, Mr Ryabinin spent more than a decade working at two governmental watchdogs as well at Nornickel’s operational safety department.After he documented the crimson stream in the Daldykan River, nearest to Power Plant 3, the father of four asked his bosses to let him take the helicopter further north to see if the spill had reached Lake Pyasino and the River Pyasino which flows into the Arctic.He recorded his video appeal and resigned after he says his bosses barred him from taking samples downstream.“It’s like you see a crime happening, you see a spill - and they tell you not to go there. How can you work like this?” Mr Ryabinin told the .The environment watchdog, Mr Ryabinin’s former employer, did not respond to requests for comment.Nornickel, the world’s largest nickel and palladium producer which posted nearly £10.4 billion in revenue last year, has blamed the incident on the thaw of permafrost, and maintains that the tank was in good shape.Official records show that the company has listed the tank as being under repair since 2016, making it off limits for authorities.The company in emailed comments to the  insisted that the tank was checked in 2017-2018 and that the inspection concluded that the tank “could be safely put to use.”Regional officials have accused Nornickel of covering up the scale of disaster for several days while Nornickel quoted communications between the company and officials to reject the suggestion.Two weeks after Mr Ryabinin’s inspection, hydrogeologist Georgiy Kavanosyan crossed Lake Pyasino and sailed a few miles downstream on the Pyasina River to check official claims that the fuel was stopped before it reached the lake.Mr Kavanosyan’s state-of-the-art equipment showed dissolved hydrocarbons in the Pyasino River at three times the normal levels.Nornickel insists that “the spread of the diesel was quickly and efficiently contained thanks to the efforts of first responders.”These findings eventually pushed Rosprirodnadzor, Mr Ryabinin’s environmental watchdog, to admit that the fuel had spread much further and have said Nornickel needs to pay £1.5 billion in damages.Nornickel accepts “full responsibility” for the spill but disagrees with what it called “gross inaccuracies” in how Rosprirodnadzor estimated the damage. Nornickel would not provide an alternative estimate.Nornickel says it managed to catch 90 per cent of the fuel spill, quoting a Norwegian consultancy company that “confirmed that most of the diesel had been collected or had evaporated.”Mr Kavanosyan finds the claim “preposterous.” “It’s not humanly possible to collect more than 50 or 60 percent of the spilled fuel simply because light hydrocarbon fractions evaporate,” he told the .Mr Kavanosyan’s calculations show that the containment booms that were installed 48 hours after the accident managed to catch the tail of the spill and that the diesel reached the Arctic’s Kara Sea two weeks later.Three decades after the Iron Curtain fell, Norilsk is still a state within a state: all passengers flying in go through passport control, and foreigners can enter town only by special permission of the FSB security agency.While in Norilsk, a Nornickel employee tried to force a  correspondent to leave the area a kilometre away from the power plant which is public property, and the  team was followed by a vehicle driven by people in Nornickel uniforms.The  visited three locations near Nornickel’s facilities where landscapes have been gutted by industrial waste in a clear indication that the fuel spill was merely one of many accidents and incidents of waste dumping.In what could make a perfect set for a sci-fi film about nuclear apocalypse, dry skeletal outlines of what were once trees stand by the Kupets River on thick layers of ore pulp that was dumped from the local copper plant for years.Nornickel told the  that the Lebyazhye dump is an “operating facility that complies with Russian laws.”Downhill from the site of the fuel spill, a stream of industrial water from the Nadezhda smelter gushes from a pipe along the crimson banks covered with ore pulp and littered with rusty pipes.Nornickel has permission to discharge water here, a few kilometres away from the Daldykan River.The company says it has been paying the state for “the negative impact of any legal discharges it makes.” Russian laws carry extremely low fines for environmental violations, often equivalent to several months’ worth of pay of just one employee.Svetlana Radionova, chief of Russia’s environmental watchdog, conceded in a recent interview with RBC TV channel that it is often “easier for businesses to pay fines” than invest in environmental upgrades.The government rarely sues companies for environmental damage. The amount of industrial waste that Nornickel dumps is hard to calculate compared to sulfur dioxide emissions coming from the city’s copper plant.Last year’s report by Greenpeace said Norilsk is the world’s biggest emitter of sulfur dioxide and is responsible for more than a half of total emissions tracked in Russia.One out of 15 kilograms of global S02 emissions comes from Norilsk.“This is an insane amount - I don’t know a single place in the world like this,” Ivan Blokov, Russia campaign director at Greenpeace, told the .Nornickel says that it has spent a lot of time looking for a solution to decrease S02 pollution since none of the currently available technology of sulfur capture is “suitable to the climate and the remote location of Norilsk.”Nornickel has been emitting far more S02 than permitted by Russian regulations, using a loophole allowing for extra emissions if a company files a plan of how to reduce them in future.Asked about the practice, the company quoted “enormous legacy problems” that the management is working to address.“Nornickel accepts full responsibility for the incidents on its sites and its overall ecological footprint,” it said, adding that “the imperative is to do everything to clean up our sites… and ensure that such situations never occur in the future.”Mr Ryabinin, the whistleblower, draws hope from the fact that his appeal has pushed the government to investigate the spill while locals have long stayed silent about industrial waste and pollution, fearing for their lucrative jobs at Nornickel.“Publicity is a powerful thing,” he says.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/11/14/trappist.jpg","title":"alien life planet solar system nasa trappist","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Other solar systems could have large numbers of planets that are home to alien life, a new study has found.The research suggests that other parts of the universe could be host to numerous planets that are habitable, unlike our solar system, where just one of the worlds has the right conditions for life to thrive.Scientists looking for life elsewhere in the universe regularly search for planets in the habitable zone, which are distant enough from their star that the water would not immediately be evaporated away, but close enough that it would not freeze.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesResearchers think that finding planets at that specific distance from their star, which is also known as the Goldilocks zone, is the best hope for finding alien life elsewhere in the universe.The new study was prompted by looking at a famous, relatively nearby planetary system – known as Trappist-1 – which has at least three planets in its habitable zone.Scientists find \u0027lost\u0027 planet in breakthroughThis made me wonder about the maximum number of habitable planets it\u0027s possible for a star to have, and why our star only has one, astrobiologist Stephen Kane from UC Riverside, who led the study published in the Astronomical Journal this week, said. It didn\u0027t seem fair!To understand how many habitable planets a solar system might be able to support, researchers create a model that allowed them to simulate planets of different sizes orbiting their stars. It accounted for the way that those planets would interact with each other as they orbited around their star, stretching over a theoretical time of millions of years.They found that a star like our Sun could support as many as six planets, each of them with liquid water and the conditions to be habitable. Other kinds of stars could support a full seven.If there are more than that, the planets would move too close to each other, disturbing their orbits.The research also helped illuminate the reason our planet has a relatively paltry one habitable planet, and the conditions that would change that. Part of our problem appears to be that the planets of our solar system move around in an oval shape – if their path is more regular and circular, they better minimise contact so that they can have more stable orbits.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It is so large – at two-and-half-times the mass of the rest of the solar system\u0027s planet combined – that it hogs the space and disturbs everything around it, the study suggests.It has a big effect on the habitability of our solar system because it\u0027s massive and disturbs other orbits, Kane said.The research could now help identify other solar systems that could be worth exploring for potential life. That could inform research by Nasa telescopes, such as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory\u0027s Habitable Exoplanet Observatory, which is looking through the universe in an attempt to find which worlds could have the right conditions to be a home.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On Saturday 1 August, American History’s Biggest Fibs with Lucy Worsley, which covers the US confederacy and the history of slavery, aired on BBC2.During a walkthrough of the time, Worsley covers the reaction to president Abraham Lincoln’s speech in 1865, which declared that black people should have the right to vote. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesJohn Wilkes Booth, the confederacy supporter who went on to assassinate Lincoln days later, was enraged by the declaration, she explains.Speaking to the camera, Worsley tells the audience: “He said, and his words carry a health warning, ‘That means n****r citizenship. By God, that’s the last speech he will ever make’.”  Every movie and TV show coming to Netflix this monthLittle Mix and Lewis Capaldi among artists to sign anti-racism letterBBC radio host issues powerful condemnation of Wiley antisemitismThe clip, which first aired on BBC4 in 2019, received a backlash on social media as viewers questioned why the word had not been censored. “So it’s just accepted that the N word is on the BBC regularly now. Is it acceptable or am I the only one continuously offended?” Jasmine Dotiwala tweeted.“Actually stunned and disgusted @Lucy_Worsley agreed to say the n word on camera like this. She’s senior enough they’d have listen to her ‘no’,” one viewer replied.“Hey @Lucy_Worsley, what’s the logic or reasoning for this? The understanding is the same if you say ‘the n-word’,” another wrote.“Also as a white woman, did you genuinely not consider that you should not be saying this word, regardless of whether this is a quote or not?”Others were not happy with the attempt to warn viewers of Worsley’s quoting the word. “A ‘health warning’? It is a racial slur. Pausing to issue some kind of imprecise euphemism acts as minimisation and is therefore racist,” one viewer said. A BBC spokesperson told The Independent: “This is a history programme about the American Civil War and features contributions from a number of African American scholars.“Content information about the nature of the film was given before the programme started, and presenter Lucy Worsley gave a clear warning to the audience before quoting John Wilkes Booth as the term clearly has the potential to cause offence.”The criticism comes after an earlier instance, in which the BBC aired a news report where a reporter used the “n-word” while describing a racist attack on an NHS worker. Fiona Lamdin, social affairs correspondent, told viewers: “Just to warn you, you’re about to hear highly offensive language” before using the term.In her report, Lamdin said: “As the men ran away they hurled racial abuse, calling him a n*****”.BBC presenter uses n-word in report on Bristol hit-and-runAfter the clip aired, the BBC received a number of complaints and later pulled the report from its catch-up service.Megha Mohan, the BBC’s gender and identity correspondent, was among those to condemn the decision to have a white reporter use the n-word.“By not saying the n-word, you send a clear signal that you will not normalise the most violent of language. It blows my mind that this is open for interpretation or being justified – especially this of all times,” she said.The BBC said the victim’s family asked for the racist slur to be used on air.“His family told the BBC about the racist language used by the attackers and wanted to see the full facts made public. A warning was given before this was reported,” a spokesperson said.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Potential uses of the helicopter could include scouting ahead of human explorers and  investigating caves and craters. It could also be used to carry small payloads across the planet.Life could exist beneath the surface of Mars, study claimsBy the way, we just had an earthquake in this room, MiMi Aung said. Although objects were rattled, but there has been no significant effects on the launch of the rocket.On Nasa\u0027s livestream, Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine noted it was lucky that the rocket was not launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base, which is also in California and has seen Nasa launches before.Many viewers commented on Twitter that the earthquake was a benefit, as it woke them up in time to watch the Perseverance mission launch.Nasa can only go to Mars once every 26 months, so missing this launch window would mean a cost of half a billion dollars to maintain the rover before it could launch again.The trip to Mars had already been delayed twice before, because of contamination problems and issues with a crane at the pad.More news can be found on The Independent\u0027s liveblog of the launch.The Nasa mission will send the rover Perseverence to search for traces of potential alien life.The car-sized six-wheeled robotic rover, ]will launch atop an Atlas 5 rocket from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance.Officials indicated that all systems appeared ready to go ahead of the launch, with weather forecasts from the Air Force\u0027s 45th Weather Squadron remaining at an 80 percent probability of launch and fuelling preparations underway for the rocket.Perseverance is due to land at the base of an 820-foot-deep (250 meters) crater called Jezero, a former lake from 3.5 billion years ago that scientists suspect could bear evidence of potential past microbial life on Mars. Scientists have long debated whether Mars - once a much more hospitable place than it is today - ever harboured life.Why Nasa\u0027s new Mars rover will be its best yetWater is considered a key ingredient for life, and the Martian surface billions of years ago had lots of it on the surface before the planet became a harsh and desolate outpost.However, scientists are unsure whether alien life could have survived in the water. Although the waters in Martian lakes appear to have a similar pH to that in Earth\u0027s oceans, other scientists have argued that it would be far too cold for life to survive.One of the most complex manoeuvres in Perseverance\u0027s journey will be what mission engineers call the “seven minutes of terror,” when the robot endures extreme heat and speeds during its descent through the Martian atmosphere, deploying a set of supersonic parachutes before igniting mini rocket engines to gently touch down on the planet\u0027s surface.It is the latest launch from Earth to Mars during a busy month of July, following probes sent by the United Arab Emirates and China.Aboard Perseverance is a four-pound (1.8 kg) autonomous helicopter named Ingenuity that is due to test powered flight on Mars for the first time.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Boris Johnson held a war game session with chancellor Rishi Sunak on Wednesday to run through possible options for averting another nationwide lockdown that could stall any potential economic recovery, The Sunday Times reports. A greater number of people would be asked to take part in the shielding programme, based on their age or particular risk factors that have been identified since March, according to The Sunday . Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOther ideas floated include restricting travel beyond the M25 to stop people travelling in and out of the capital and putting an end to overnight stays at other people\u0027s houses.Government still planning to reopen all schools in September, says ministerMinisters accused of \u0027negligence\u0027 towards care home residents and staffMinister casts doubt over shielding and London lockdown reportsVictoria declares state of emergency as curfew imposedBoris Johnson urged to resume\u0026nbspdaily briefings for \u0027confused\u0027 publicLondon \u0027could face localised lockdown\u0027 if cases begin to spikeElderly people \u0027could be asked to shield again\u0027 to avoid second waveSouth African president sees \u0027promising signs\u0027President Cyril Ramaphosa said the coronavirus outbreak in South Africa appears to be stabilising after the number of cases passed 500,000 last night.In a letter to the nation, he said the infection rate had slowed in the provinces of the Western Cape, which includes Cape Town, the Eastern Cape and Gauteng, and the major cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria.After a rapid rise in infections over the last two months, the daily increase in infections appears to be stabilizing, he said.The health system has so far had sufficient capacity to cope with the number of admissions.He also said South African authorities were working to root out corruption in the purchase and distribution of medical equipment, adding:\u0026nbspIt is unconscionable that there are people who may be using this health crisis to unlawfully enrich themselves.South Africa (population 58m) has the fifth-highest number of cases in the world, behind the US, Brazil, Russia and India. It confirmed a further 10,107 cases on Saturday, bringing the\u0026nbsptotal to 503,290, including 8,153 deaths.A long-serving manager of a bakery has been fired for “gross misconduct” because she had been accepting\u0026nbspcash\u0026nbspfrom elderly customers without bank cards and using her own debit card to pay.Megan Metcalfe, 60, had worked for Birds Bakery in Radcliffe-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, for 44 years and served as store manager for 25 years until her dismissal.“I was just trying to do the right thing,” she was quoted as saying. “I am really upset by it of course… I was told I was endangering staff members’ lives by doing what I did.”\u0026nbspRandom coronavirus testing at Irish airportsThe Irish government is planning to introduce random testing for\u0026nbspcoronavirus\u0026nbspat airports.Health minister\u0026nbspStephen Donnelly said the decision had been made to target foreign travel because the\u0026nbspinternational situation is becoming more volatile.We\u0027re introducing random testing at the airports and an increased public health presence and we are examining other options as well for further restrictions on non-essential travel, he told RTE radio.The international situation is becoming more volatile, we\u0027re looking at what has been happening in the United States and Latin America and even closer to home - Spain, Germany, France and parts of England and Australia.We\u0027re taking a cautious approach and we\u0027re continuing to take a cautious approach, he said.UK death toll rises by 8 to 46,201A further eight deaths and 744 cases of coronavirus have been reported in the UK, according to government statistics.It brings the total to 46,201 deaths in hospitals, care homes and the wider community and 304,685 cases.However the government is still reviewing the figures amid concerns they include people who died weeks or months after recovering from Covid-19.Separate figures published by the UK\u0027s statistics agencies show there have now been 56,400 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.China sends team to Hong Kong for widespread coronavirus testingSeven Chinese health officials arrived in Hong Kong today, the first members of a 60-person team that will carry out widespread Covid-19 testing in the territory as it races to halt a third wave of illness.The initiative marks the first time mainland health officials have assisted Hong Kong in its battle to control the epidemic.The city has reported around 3,500 coronavirus cases and 34 deaths since January, far lower than many other global metropolitan centres. But the daily number of new infections has been in three digits for the past 12 days.Members of the testing team, co-ordinated by the Chinese government, are mostly from public hospitals in Guangdong province, China\u0027s National Health Commission said.A group of local Hong Kong councillors said on Sunday that some local residents fear China may use their presence as an opportunity to collect DNA samples for surveillance purposes.The territory\u0027s government denied the claims, saying virus testing would only be conducted in the city and samples would not be transported to the mainland.In June, to widespread criticism in the West, Beijing imposed a security law on the territory to tackle what China defines as secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces, punishable by up to life in prison.Hong Kong\u0027s autonomy was guaranteed under a one country, two systems formula when Britain returned the city to Chinese control in 1997.ReutersBoris Johnson ‘orders preparations to avoid second national lockdown’\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFlights between Turkey and Iraq suspendedFlights between Turkey and Iraq have been suspended because of rising coronavirus infections in Turkey, Iraq\u0027s Aviation Authority said.Iraq reopened Baghdad and southern airports last week for international travel after months of closure caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The government\u0027s Eat Out to Help Out scheme, which began yesterday, is explained in this video\u0026nbspThai army suspends US\u0026nbsptraining plans after soldiers contract Covid-19Thailand has suspended plans for its army to undertake joint training with the US military after nine Thai soldiers tested positive for coronavirus upon returning from Hawaii, the defence ministry said.The Thai Army said the infected soldiers were among 151 Thai officers who had returned from Lightning Forge 2020 training with US\u0026nbspsoldiers in Hawaii for the first three weeks of July.The army has suspended all plans to bring forces abroad until the situation improves, said defence ministry spokesman Kongcheep Tantawanich.Thailand had no plans for joint training with other countries but the United States, he said.Nattapon Srisawat, the head of the Thai Army\u0027s anti-Covid-19 unit, told Reuters the army had to exercise caution. It will be difficult to travel at the moment as we have to be careful, he said.Thailand has reported 3,317 cases and 58 deaths. Recent infections were imported from abroad, marking 69 successive days without of any domestic transmission.ReutersWho will be among first to receive US vaccine?US\u0026nbsphealth authorities hope to have some draft guidance on how to ration initial vaccine doses\u0026nbspby late next month.Dr Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, recently told one of the advisory groups the government asked to help decide:\u0026nbspNot everybody\u0027s going to like the answer. There will be many people who feel that they should have been at the top of the list.Traditionally, first in line for a scarce vaccine are health workers and the people most vulnerable to the targeted infection.But Dr Collins tossed new ideas into the mix, including to consider geography and give priority to people where an outbreak is hitting hardest.He also said the volunteers in the final stage of vaccine testing should are owed some special priority.APIreland considering additional travel measuresIreland is considering additional measures to limit non-essential travel in the wake of an uptick in coronavirus infections in recent days both in Ireland and other European countries, health minister Stephen Donnelly said.Ireland already advises against all non-essential international travel and requires people arriving from all but 15 countries to self-isolate for 14 days, but it does not require Covid-19 tests from visitors and has not banned flights from any country.We\u0027re introducing random testing at the airports and an increased public health presence and we\u0027re examining other options as well for further restrictions on non-essential travel... because the international situation is becoming more volatile, Mr Donnelly told RTE radio.Vietnam says origin of Danang outbreak hard to trackVietnamese authorities said they were finding it hard to track the origin of a fresh coronavirus outbreak that began in the central city of Danang and has infected around 200 people in recent weeks.In Danang, there are many sources of virus, and there are still many infections out there in the community, a government statement said of the city, a popular tourist hotspot with a population of 1.1 million.The country reported 34 infections on Sunday, bringing the total number of coronavirus cases to 620. The death toll rose by two to five, the Health Ministry said in a statement.Health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said the strain of the virus detected in the new outbreak is a more contagious one.He said with the new strain, each infected person may infect about 5-6 people compared to 1.8-2.2 people in the previous period.Authorities have taken a series of unprecedented measures to fight the outbreak in Danang, including the mobilisation of several hundred military school students to help with contact tracing and collecting test samples, the government said in its statement.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 30. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 430 27. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 630 25. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Magic realism comes to Netflix in this coming-of-age story set in Dakar, Senegal. Ada (Mame Bineta Sane) is betrothed to a wealthy man but then falls in love with construction worker Souleiman (Ibrahima Traoré). When he vanishes her world is tipped head-over-heels. In truth, the bare-bone plot is merely the chassis upon which director Mati Diop drapes a hallucinatory romance and mystery with elements of the supernatural.Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Price twinkle ecumenically in this two-hander about Pontiffs Benedict XVI (Hopkins) and Francis (Price) who are thrown together at a time of crisis for the Church. The two leads were nominated for Oscars, as was screenwriter Anthony McCarten, adapting his 2019 play of the same name.Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1630 15. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1730 14. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.2030 11. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2330 8. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? Adam Sandler blazes like a diamond-drill in Josh and Benny Safdie’s sensory-rush drama about a jeweller and gambling addict trying to hold onto his sanity as his world comes crashing down. It’s an exhausting, sometimes overwhelming watch – but with Sandler as the audience’s lodestar, it’s a journey worth staying with.Noah Baumbach draws on the breakdown of his marriage to Jennifer Jason Leigh in this unflinching chronicling of a modern orce. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are compelling as a couple who wake one morning to discover they’ve fallen out of love, while Laura Dern deservedly won an Oscar as Johansson’s force-of-nature attorney.2730 4. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2830 3. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. Teaming up with De Niro, Pacino and Joe Pesci, Martin Scorsese suggested The Irishman might be the cinematic event of the decade. There is certainly lots to love in this generations-ning tale of hitman Frank Sheeran (De Niro) and his relationship with union boss Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) and his own daughter (Anna Paquin). True, the film isn’t quite a classic at the level of Goodfellas. The de-aging technology employed to turn the cast into thirtysomething gangsters feels rubbery and unconvincing. And the 209-minute running time left many viewers suffering numb bum. But it’s still Scorsese doing mobsters and unmistakably the work of a director reaching for a big artistic statement.The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  130 30. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises.

Listen to the full interview below:Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has known West for around 10 years, recently said he had reached out to him after his outbursts on Twitter. In one string of posts, West claimed his wife, Kim Kardashian-West, had tried to get a doctor to have him “locked up”, and also appeared to accuse her and his mother-in-law, Kris Jenner, of being white supremacists. “When he was about a third of the way through the tweet rampage, just to see if he was doing OK, I sent him a text saying, you know, just checking on you, a lot of people are worried, just wondering if you’re OK,” Musk was quoted as saying. “And he called me back and he actually seemed fine. He video FaceTimed me and he was in Wyoming with a bunch of friends. He seemed fine on the call. But it sounds like things are, you know, not fine. There seem to be a lot of issues.”After West’s tweets, which were quickly deleted, Kardashian-West wrote in a statement on Instagram: “As many of you know, Kanye has bipolar disorder. Anyone who has this or has a loved one in their life who does, knows how incredibly complicated and painful it is to understand.”If you are experiencing feelings of distress and isolation, or are struggling to cope, The Samaritans offers support you can speak to someone for free over the phone, in confidence, on 116 123 (UK and ROI), email jo@samaritans.org, or visit the Samaritans website to find details of your nearest branch.If you are based in the USA, and you or someone you know needs mental health assistance right now, call National Suicide Prevention Helpline on 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Now they are trying to crowdfund £7,500 to apply for indefinite leave to remain, meaning they can stay in Britain for good.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMs Smith Fustiye said she felt “let down” over being excluded from a new bereavement scheme, which would help her family to stay in the UK, because her keyworker husband was not an NHS, health or care worker – like herself. The system grants family members automatic indefinite leave to remain at no cost to them if their loved one was one of these workers and dies from Covid-19.

She told The Independent that free and automatic indefinite leave to remain ”would give me space to breathe and grieve”. “Currently, the situation feels like we can’t,” she added. Ms Smith Fustiye said she is faced with “extortionate fees” instead. Her husband, who was originally from Jamaica but became a British citizen after moving to the UK, worked at Nottingham City Council for more than 15 years. They knew each other from their youth in Jamaica and and got back in touch around a decade ago. They started a relationship and got married – with Ms Smith Fustiye moving to the UK to join her new husband in 2014.Eventually, she was also able to bring her two children over to the UK.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Speaking about Ms Smith Fustiye’s case, Joel Matsiko, her immigration adviser, told The Independent: “The only reason she is not eligible for the free scheme is her husband was not a health and social care worker – albeit he was a respected key worker to the city of Nottingham.” He added: “The Windrush scandal and the Windrush Lessons Learnt Review have all proven that right now black lives have not mattered regarding the UK’s immigration policy. There has also been the disproportionate impact Covid-19 has had on Bame people not just in the UK but across the world. These facts matter is Ms Smith’s campaign.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Our thoughts are with all those who have sadly lost loved ones during this unprecedented pandemic and we are hugely grateful for the incredible work of health and care workers in the fight against coronavirus.”They added: “During this outbreak we have put a range of measures in place to support NHS, health and care workers, including introducing free one-year visa extensions and exemptions from the NHS surcharge.”Leave to Remain\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspindefinite leave to remain\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailBut he said that getting all schools back for all pupils in September would be a priority should there be a second spike of infections.“Reopening schools and getting our children back into the classroom with that direct face-to-face contact with their teachers will be a priority for the government when we have to make those tough choices,” he said.Mr Jenrick added: “We want to ensure that schools return in September. We need to get all of our kids back to school. We’ve set out very detailed guidance as to how we can do that. We think we can do that safely.“Schools are working very hard to put those plans into practice… Obviously we will keep working with teachers and their unions to give them confidence, and we want to get all political parties behind us on this, because I think there are few things more important to the future of this country than getting children back to school in the classroom from September.”Responding to reports of plans to require over-50s to “shield” themselves from coronavirus while allowing younger people free movement, Mr Jenrick said: “This is just speculation.“You would expect the government to be considering all of the range of options that might be available.“That’s not something that is being actively considered.”He said any fresh restrictions were unlikely to apply wholesale, adding: “We don’t want to do anything that is a blanket approach across the country.“Our strategy is to manage this in a localised way with targeted action as we’ve done in Leicester, as we’re doing now in the northwest.“We will follow the data and look at options if we have to but that approach is the way we restrict in certain areas – it is difficult for those who live there but it provides greater freedom for the rest of the country, for businesses to reopen and for people to get on with their daily lives, and that has to be the way forward if we can.”Asked whether there were plans to put London under lockdown if Covid-19 rates increased, he added: “Not as far as I’m aware.“We’re taking a very localised approach following the data and I’m working, for example, with each of the directors of public health in the London boroughs who are monitoring the rate of transmission in their own areas very closely.“There is no plan, as far as I’m aware, to do anything broader in London.”Meanwhile, Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said it had become clear that there is a link between closing schools and controlling the spread of the virus. “The evidence is clear that schools are important in the spread of Covid-19,” he said. “Our studies show that, across Europe, closing schools was the single factor most strongly associated with drops in infection rates.”Prof Hunter added that while inidual risks to children and teachers were probably low, school transmission was likely to push up general infection rates, so the disease would rise exponentially again. “Would reopening schools increase the spread of Covid-19 in the population? Yes. I think it would very probably do that.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

From the start, Kate was horried at the way Meghan spoke to staff members at Kensington Palace and it was clear they would never click in the way Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson had once done.The now infamous tiara row, which I first revealed in November , was the culmination of many fallouts before the wedding.Afterwards, William and the Queen’s dresser and closest confidante, Angela Kelly, were united in their decision not to loan Meghan items from the Royal Collection, which included tiaras worn by Diana.As I began to report these stories, it is true to say Harry and Meghan became suspicious of their own staff, incorrectly believing they had been somehow hijacked by dark forces, the so-called “men in grey suits”, at Buckingham Palace.That categorisation is too simplistic.Who are these men  They may have existed in , but the senior figures in key roles behind the scenes within the Royal Family tend to be thoroughly modern members of the metropolitan elite these days.While it is correct to say they encouraged the couple to follow more conventional processes in terms of their dealings with other royal households and the Press, the real-le Sussex Squad was doggedly committed to the couple’s principles and goals.For example, their communications chief Sara Latham — blamed by Meghan for any negative stories in British newspapers — was a highly successful opera- tor who had worked for Hillary Clinton.She was prepared to pack up her le in London and move to Africa with the couple perman- ently to help achieve their humanitarian goals.Much official time and energy was put into the South African relocation planonly for the couple to eventually brand it too dficult.Instead, Harry and Meghan foolishly began to rely almost entirely on advice provided by a small team of fiercely loyal Hollywood advisers.I managed to unpick details of this secret cabal throughout the latter half of last year, but they had been causing major headaches for Buckingham Palace long before that.The group — attorney Rick Genow, business manager Andrew Meyer and talent agent Nick Collins — are typical Hollywood “Yes” people.Just as important were her PR advisers from the controversial crisis management firm Sunshine Sachs, specically Shawn Sachs and Keleigh Thomas Morgan.They had all become close with Meghan while she was a moderate star on the cable TV legal drama Suits, an era when she was so desperate for coverage in magazines she would even set up shots with paparazzi photog- raphers.She kept the Hollywood crew largely on the sidelines during the early days of her courtship with Harry. But as tensions with royal courtiers increased, so too did Meghan’s contact with them.It was this team who bunkered down with Meghan over Christmas and New Year in Canada, secretly drafting the content for the Sussex Royal website that, when published,like a Hollywood press release than a statement of intent by two senior members of the British Royal Family.Much has been written about how I broke the story of Megxit, with the finger incorrectly being pointed at both Clarence House and Kensington Palace.The couple like to promote the idea that they were somehow ambushed into revealing their plans after we published the world exclusive on January .However, they neglect to mention I had originally put the story to their office ten days earlier and had discussed every aspect of what we eventually published with their officials.It is not a coincidence my first story of the move included details of the Sussexes’ unhappiness about the release of photographs over Christmas featuring the Queen, Charles, William and George.The biography goes further by pointing to the absence of a picture of Harry, Meghan and Archie on the Queen’s table during her annual Christmas Day message.It is inconceivable to me that this wasn’t a purposeful slight by the institution, trying to make a point to Harry and Meghan: “Come back and join the party during events like Christmas or we’ll pretend you don’t exist.”It backfired spectacularly.So can such a toxic relationship be healed There is a growing acknowledgement from both sides that so long as Harry and Meghan’s romantic relationship remains strong, that is highly unlikely.But this book is a spectacular own goal by a couple who like to insist they are opposed to bitchy off-the-record briefings and royal revelations using source quotes slagging off other members of The Firm.Because fundamentally, that’s all Finding Freedom is.Unlike Andrew Morton’s game-changing Diana: Her True Story, there is no revelation that makes you think dferently about what went on.A couple desperate to blame others for their unwise decisions have allowed a fanboy “journalist” to confirm a whole load of newspaper exclusives, which they incidentally denied at the time, but spun with their own, often , narrative.Harry and Meghan are not victims of the media, the establishment or the British public.I will never forget that beautul spring day in May  when the entire country celebrated a royal wedding with the type of hope and joy not seen since July , when Charles and Diana tied the knot.It was one of those rare moments, like the London  Olympics, when we celebrated as one.This couple had the world at their feet — superstardom and influence any film actor or pop star would dream of, but without the cumbersome pressure of the throne hanging over them, like the Cambridges.They had a very real chance to help reinvent and modernise the monarchy from within.What a tragedy they have chosen to focus their energies on settling scores in tawdry tell-alls and unnecessary courtroom battles.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you live in the affected areas, you should not visit someones home or garden regardless of whether this is in or outside of the restricted area.The mixup came as England was hit with  new positive cases – the highest number in  days – adding to fears the country is facing a second wave of the virus.But the sudden new rules - which means that people can still go to work and even visit shops and cafes - have left Brits reeling after they were introduced about .pm, barely three hours before they were put into force.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to discuss the matter in his coronavirus press conference today.What the new rules mean:About .million people will be affected by the new lockdown rules - which are expected to be subject to a weekly review.The affected areas include all of the .million residents of Greater Manchester, as well as the Lancashire towns of Blackburn, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle and Rossendale.West Yorkshire, Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees were also hit.Leicester was also included in the households ban, but pubs, restaurants and hairdressers will reopen on Monday.However, leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed.Earlier Mr Hancock has admitted Muslims living in the area will have their Eid celebrations affected.He said: My heart goes out to the Muslim community. I know that this will have a particular impact on Eid celebrations. Weve been working with Imams and religious leaders to ensure that Eid celebrations can go ahead in a co-vid secure way in mosques and there are some really innovative proposals to celebrate in parks where social distancing is easier and theres more space. But it does mean, for everybody, meetings between households wont be possible and of course that has a particular impact when theres a celebration like Eid coming up for the Muslim community. Baroness Sayeeda Warsi today slammed the lack of clarity over the message on Good Morning Britain, saying she had received calls up to am overnight by confused members of the community.She said: “There is still not clarity on whether that means you can meet outdoors, thankfully there is still some clarication that those mosques that had prepared for Covid Eid prayers with the proper procedures would be allowed to go ahead.“People have voluntarily been part of this response and I think it would have been better to do this with a little more understanding and clarity.”Labour leader Keir Starmer said he would not argue with local action to reduce the transmission of the virus but said: Announcing measures affecting potentially millions of people late at night on Twitter is a new low for the government’s communications during this crisis.He added: For all the bluster, government has failed to deliver a ing track and trace system that would spot local flare ups like these.Lucy Powell, the MP for Manchester Central, said she had been blindsided by the new rules.And Health Secretary Matt Hancock this morning was left trying to defend the move, saying the move had been absolutely necessary.Speaking to Sky News, he said the new rules were crystal clear, saying the test and trace data had shown most of the transmission is happening between households.He added: Everyone can see that the problem with this virus is it thrives on the social contact that makes le worth living.The Health Secretary had last night said he was introducing the new measures with a heavy heart - tweeting the announcement at .pm with details published two hours later before the full guidelines were released this morning.Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said there had been a “marked change” across his boroughs in recent days.Speaking on Good Morning Britain today, he said: The truth of the matter is the pub is a more regulated environment, as is public transport where people are supposed to wear face masks.The home is a less regulated.And he defended the sudden introduction of the new guidelines, saying the virus could move quickly.Lib Dem leader Ed Davey wrote: How this lockdown in Manchester, East Lancs  West Yorks has been introduced is worrying, confusing, frustrating and damaging.No-one doubts these are dficult decisions - but when lives of millions of people are involved, Ministers have a duty to communicate professionally.Others took issue with Wigan being included in the fresh lockdown rules, saying that it had been lumped in with Greater Manchesters rise without recording an increase itself.One local tweeted: Wigan has the lowest rate of cases in Greater Manchester... its not our fault other parts of Manchester are letting the side down.Another added: Wigan has  cases per , and is on lockdown. City of London has  cases per , and no lockdown. Wonder why that is.The shock announcement came after Boris Johnson warned between ten and  places in Britain are seeing Covid- cases “bubbling up”.Speaking in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, the PM said yesterday: “There are between ten and  places where you are seeing it bubbling up a little bit.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Prince Harry’s actress ex Cressida Bonas had secretly tied the knot to beau Harry Wentworth-Stanley in a private country ceremony. The actress previously dated the Duke of Sussex for three years after being introduced by Princess Eugenie, before breaking off their relationship in April  – allegedly after getting spooked by the idea of le as a royal.And while Harry has since quit royal le to get married and move to LA with we Meghan Markle and son Archie, here’s a closer look at what the -year-old’s reported former flames have been up to since.Arguably his most serious relationship before Meghan, Prince Harry was in an on-off relationship with Chelsy Davy, now , for six years from .However, the Zimbabwe-born former law student struggled to cope with the scrutiny that came with dating a royal, telling The Times: “It was so full on: crazy and scary and uncomfortable.” Following their split, the pair maintained a good friendship, with Chelsy even attending Harry’s  wedding. Now, businesswoman Chelsy is a jewellery designer who ides her time between Africa and the UK, and recently revealed she’s started dating someone new.  While a romance was never officially confirmed by either party, presenter Natalie Pinkham, now , and Prince Harry were rumoured to be an item briefly in , and the pair even enjoyed a holiday together in Botswana -–a place he most recently took

Harry got together with Meghan their relationship rapidly changed – it just went flat and noticeably cooled off.”Now, Natalie continues to work as a F Sky Sports presenter, and is happily married to TV exec husband Owain Walbyoff, who she shares two children with. The pair married in  in Portugal in front of star studded guests including Harry’s cousin, Zara Phillips, and recently celebrated their eighth wedding anniversary. Former lingerie model Cassie Sumner met the prince in  on a night out at Chinawhite nightclub – and went on to reveal details of the one night fling in an interview, claiming he kissed Towie reality star Lauren Pope earlier the same evening. However it wasn’t a serious or long-lasting romance, and Cassie went on to marry footballer Jose Fonte.Now, the couple have two children together.Kate Middleton’s very well connected friend Astrid Harbord – who attended the Duchess’ hen do – and Harry were linked in , after being spotted hanging out together in London. However, while the pair have been pictured at the same events over the years, Harry reportedly ‘cut ties’ with the glam socialite once he started dating Meghan. Now, Astrid is a company director, and founder of Lady Garden, a national women’s health charity encouraging conversation about gynaecological health. When bomb disposal expert Camilla Thurlow joined Love Island in , rumours began to swirl about her  dalliance with Harry – although the now -year-old reality TV star remained tight-lipped on the ITV show. Since then, Camilla’s quest to find true love has paid off, and she remains in one of the few successful Love Island relationships with co-star, model Jamie Jewitt, with the pair recently announcing they’re expecting their first child together.Camilla, who also recently published a book, isn’t the only Love Island star Prince Harry has been linked to. Presenter Caroline Flack, who tragically took her own le earlier this year aged just , had also once been romantically associated to the prince, describing herself as his “bit of rough” after the pair were introduced via mutual friends in .Norwegian rock star Camilla Romestrand – lead singer of band Eddie the Gun – claimed she stayed over at Clarence House and Prince Harry served her breakfast in bed – an account never confirmed by the prince. Now, the Scandinavian beauty is a mum of two with a passion for vegan cooking, and lives predominantly out of the spotlight. Model Florence Brudenell-Bruce, or Flee as she’s known to close friends, had known Harry for a few years before they were linked romantically in , just after his final split from Chelsy. Flee, now , had another high-profile romance when she dated Formula One racing driver Jenson Button until .She went on to marry multi-millionaire Henry St George in , in a romantic ceremony in the south of France, and the couple now have two children.Most recently, she starred in Channel ’s The Great Pottery Throwdown, after revealing shes got into ceramics to overcome post-natal depression. Saturdays pop princess Mollie King, now , bagged herself a few dates with Harry in , and speaking at the time, the singer confessed: “Yes, I have met Harry, and we did go out for a drink.”However, her public profile was dficult to navigate for Harry, and he reportedly called things off.Meanwhile Mollie went on to date supermodel David Gandy for five years, star on Strictly and land a BBC Radio One presenting job. Now, Mollie’s happily loved up with England cricketer boyfriend Stuart Broad, who she’s been dating on and off since early . After being pictured “canoodling” at a polo match together in , singer Ellie Goulding and Prince Harry were reportedly an item, exchanging flirty texts, with one onlooker even claiming they shared a kiss while under a blanket. They became close after Ellie performed at his brother William’s wedding to Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton, and she attended the Invictus Games with the prince in . While things clearly didn’t work out, the pop star still had her own ‘royal wedding’ at York Minster Cathedral, which was estimated could have cost up to £million. Guests included Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice, royal photographer Matt Porteous captured their big day, and crowds lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the bride as she made her way to the altar to wed art dealer Casper Jopling. It hasn’t all been smooth sailing however – Ellie recently revealed she hadn’t seen her mother Tracey since the wedding last August. Doctor Who actress Jenna Coleman was rumoured to have briefly dated Harry in , with the Duke pictured resting his hand on Jenna’s leg at a posh polo party. However, it didn’t last, and when their paths crossed in  while Harry was on a secret trip to Amsterdam with Meghan, the pair had an ‘awkward’ encounter and avoided speaking, with a source telling Vanity Fair: “It was pretty awkward and some of the other guests were commenting on it.Jenna looked down while Harry looked straight ahead, while Meghan didn’t seem to notice.Jenna, now , went on to date Victoria co-star Tom Hughes for four years, before splitting recently, with a source telling The Sun: “Both Tom and Jenna are terribly sad, but the relationship ran its course. “Jenna’s career is going from strength to strength, she’s being offered increasingly more roles abroad, especially Los Angeles, and she wants to focus on this while she’s still young.”So while Prince Harry has moved on from his lothario days to settle down, given the amount of lavish weddings and babies among them, it seems the majority of his past loves have also quite happily been able to put their royal romance behind them too. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make

By giving a large number of his cronies peerages, he has shown that the Tories have abandoned any pretence of reducing the size of the bloated House of Lords.Labour MP John Trickett tweeted: Tell me it’s not true.

That he can get away with it shows what a private member’s club this house is.“Is packing the Lords with party loyalists really a priority, as a pandemic rages across the world  This move is an absolute insult to voters.

She has always been there in the background, just quietly getting on with it, with absolutely no fuss.Fuss, in fact, is clearly something that the royal has no time for as Anne was astonished to learn it takes Erin Doherty — the actress who plays her in the third series of The Crown — two hours to style her hair, as opposed to the “ten or  minutes” it takes Anne. I loved the portrayal of the young princess in the Netflix series: Down to earth, feisty and straightforward, which I suspect is accurate to a tee.I have always wondered whether the royals watch the drama and Princess Anne revealed she did and found it “quite interesting”.She was followed for more than a year by the filmmakers of Anne: The Princess Royal At , which also featured unseen family footage and interviews with her loved ones.I loved the stories from her children, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall, describing how she wouldfrom royal s in her glamorous outfits and head straight to their farm to tend to the animals.Zara said: “She’d come home from engagements in exactly what she was wearing, make-up on, put her welly boots on, jacket on, do her chickens and get her eggs.”The appealing thing about Princess Anne is her work ethic and how happy she is to stay in the background.Her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, said: “She’s not a person that is constantly looking for praise. She gets on and does her work regardless because she thinks it’s important.”So it came as no surprise when Anne declared in the documentary that she would not go on Twitter “evenyou paid me”.Princess Anne is not the only hard-working royal, of course.Her brother Prince Edward and his we Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, do loads of good work and are similarly modest in their approach.These members of the Royal Family are in stark contrast to Harry and Meghan, who claim that work is more important than anything , but rarely get on with it quietly.After all, Princess Anne does her job brilliantly, with no whinging or whining, and still remains out of the spotlight, which proves it can be done.Another appealing trait of Anne’s is her modesty about how hard she works. She has no intention of slowing down, despite being old enough to retire.She’s a credit to her family and the Queen — and the two of them clearly have a lot in common.I loved watching them interact and seeing that mother-daughter bond. You can see there’s real affection there. And what a great, dry sense of humour they both have.So it’s nice to watch something positive about the Royal Family these days.By simply being herself in the documentary, Princess Anne has generated more positive PR for the monarchy than it has had in a very long while.LOOKING at pictures of Gwyneth Paltrow on Instagram promoting a ready-to-drink brand of organic cocktails, I found myself thinking that no matter how much some people want to hate her, Gwyneth comes across as enviably wholesome, gorgeous, healthy . . . and probably a really nice person.The bottom line is that anyone who says they hate her is almost certainly just jealous.I AM so proud our national game has signed up to the Mentally Healthy Football Declaration, which urges young men – and men of all ages, in fact – to talk about their feelings, which is something males traditionally seem to struggle with.We can talk about the THEORY of mental health all we like but the power of role models, particularly for young guys, is immense.So it is lovely to see some footballing greats being open and honest about their own mental health – and the fact things haven’t always necessarily been rosy in the garden throughout their lives.Spearheaded by the Duke of Cambridge, the campaign is designed to make mental health a priority across all levels of football.So kudos to former England captain David Beckham, Aston Villa defender Tyrone Mings, Crystal Palace winger Andros Townsend and Manchester City and England skipper Steph Houghton for talking frankly about their own mental health and the state of play in football more generally.Beckham, in particular, yields great influence. Hearing him talk about the effects of being vilied and abused by fans after he was red-carded against Argentina in the  World Cup was very powerful.“When I look back on it now, I didn’t realise how hard it was,” he says. “The times I’ve faced adversity throughout my career – and ’ was by far the toughest – did I feel OK to go to someone and say I needed help  No. I felt I had to keep it all in and deal with it myself.“Now I’m preaching to my kids and to other kids that it’s really important to talk. It’s OK not to be OK and it’s OK to say that. It’s OK to come out and say, ‘I need help’.”Let’s hope young men everywhere take that on board and realise it’s good to talk.People with a negative outlook about the present or future die two years earlier than the average person, according to new research.According to the Aussie team that did the research, from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Brisbane, one reason for this might be that pessimists do not look after themselves as well, which has an impact on their health.The world is half-full of pessimists . . . or half-empty, depending on how you look at it. But the bottom line is that a positive mind and spirit equal positive outcomes, while a negative mind and spirit equal negative outcomes.So let’s all start looking on the bright side, shall we  Good. I am SO glad we had this chat.HEARING what it takes for models to look the way they do is always interesting.And by “interesting”, I mean it gives us a helpful reminder of how unrealistic expectations can be for women over their appearance.Brazilian model Vanusa Freitas,  – who clearly DOES look amazing – has shared the secret of how she looks the way she does.In preparation for a Playboy Portugal shoot, Vanusa exercised for eight hours a day and ate only egg whites.She said she was inspired by Kim Kardashian, which perhaps gave her the necessary discipline to deny herself food and, by the sound of things, time to do much  but work out.If spending the day in the gym and eating only egg whites is what is required to look like her, well . . . frankly, I’d rather have a le.Just reading the story made me feel sick.Roger Spackman, , was a Labour member of Exeter City Council until his arrest in  and worked at a secure children’s home.But the judge assessing his case this week decided Spackman would not himself commit abuse – so handed him only a suspended jail term.Yet the reality is that, by possessing these images, he is part of a cycle of horric abuse.Forty days of rehab is not going to change his desire to look at this kind of material.Time in prison would be a more fitting consequence – and perhaps some deterrent for the people who produce horric, disturbing images of children being harmed.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My colleagues both in those settings and in other settings share my views.Ive not come across somebody who has said that visors are the best thing.Dr Ben Killingley, a consultant in infectious diseases who sits on Nervtag, said: I dont know where it came from, where someone decided that just wearing a visor for hairdressers alone would be enough. That doesnt make sense to me.A visor is primarily worn to protect workers from splashes. It does the same job as goggles, protecting the eyes. No healthcare worker would ever wear a visor without a mask.You would have thought for their own protection and just in case they have been infected themselves, they should be wearing a mask themselves.

Zero protection, Id say.He added that while his own mask provided protection against possible viral droplets, it would have failed to prevent corneal seeding, where Covid- particles enter the eyes.The concerns come after Prime Minister Boris Johnson hit the brakes on easing the coronavirus lockdown - saying he wouldnt stand by and allow the virus to cause more pain and heartache in this country.He announced that most of the measures which were to be lted today would now be put on ice for two weeks.He also hinted at backtracking the easing of lockdown even further after new rules banning households from meeting each other in homes were announced for Greater Manchester, parts of East Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire overnight.Dr Killingley cited a study in the US which found that no Covid- cases were reported among  clients who were exposed to two asymptomatic hair stylists in Missouri.Both of the stylists were wearing surgical masks or cotton face coverings at each appointment, as were their clients.The government’s current advice for those working in “close contact services” such as hairdressers and beauty salons, states: Clearly, when providing close contact services, it often may not be possible to maintain social distancing guidelines .As a result, personal protective equipment in the form of a visor will be required to mitigate the risk.The NHBF, the trade body for hairdressers, beauty salons and barbers, states on its website: Clients may wear face coveringsthey wish and staff can wear a face covering in addition to a visor, but not instead of one.It added it relied on the Government for advice about personal protective equipment.A Government spokesman said: “Advice for hairdressers remains unchanged and is that they should continue to wear visors. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Itll be open until ! It deserves to be open, another posted.Preston City Council made a last-minute U-turn on Saturday to allow Switch to reopen, despite saying just hours earlier that it couldnt.Following fresh external Counsel advice, Preston City Council has just informed Switch that despite yesterday’s clear Government guidance to the contrary, they are legally able to reopen, the council said in an official statement about pm last night.Councillor Peter Moss said the council sought expert external legal advice on Switchs reopening.This advice has just come back to inform us that Switch is legally able to repurpose and reopen accordingly, he said.This is on the strict basis that Switch proceeds with the agreed safety precautions and do not allow dancing in the venue, the venue is now free to reopen this evening.We appreciate this is a very dferent position to what we announced earlier. Officers have been working tirelessly to resolve the situation in the best way.We do ask all patrons who attend to take the safety precautions very seriously, to prevent further spread of coronavirus in Preston.Councillor Freddie Bailey said it was irresponsible for Switch to reopen.Preston is having a spike [in coronavirus cases]. Obviously theyre legally allowed to open, we didnt want them to open, but because of government advice theres nothing to stop them opening, he said.We sought external advice and thats what the advice came back with.He said Preston residents upset about the nightclub reopening should be angry at central government.Earlier this month, Boris Johnson said nightclubs must remain shut despite coronavirus lockdown measures easing - but live indoor concerts will be able to resume with socially-distanced audiences from August .Despite the rules, Switch announced on social media that it would be reopening.We know you have all been waiting... the beast is back! the nightclub posted on Facebook.Switch claims it will have a lower capacity in all four of their rooms to help with social distancing while both standing and sitting customers have to buy tickets online.Things will be a little dferent but we have a full roster of amazing live entertainment over four rooms, Switch posted on Facebook.The night out doesnt come cheap - tickets start from £ with the club charging up to £ for VIP night out in Preston.Revellers have been told to arrive at designated times to ease queues and to follow one-way paths once inside.The club plans to now be open on Fridays and Saturdays.A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman said: Its very dficult to open nightclubs, dance halls and discos safely - so for now the law in England is that they must stay closed.The Sun Online has contacted Switch nightclub and the Preston City Council for comment.Switch Preston is just  miles away from Greater Manchester, where millions have been locked down after a coronavirus spike.From July , the new rules ban dferent households in Greater Manchester, parts of east Lancashire and West Yorkshire from meeting each other inside their homes or even in gardens.The government announced the measures at .pm on Thursday, July , less than three hours before they took effect at midnight.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said households gathering and not abiding by the social-distancing rules was a reason for the stricter rules and that the move was in order to keep the country safe.He said: We take this action with a heavy heart but unfortunately its necessary because weve seen that households meeting up and a lack of social distancing is one of the causes of this rising rate of coronavirus and well do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Radical measures drawn up in a government war-game included a programme of enhanced shielding - with vulnerable people asked to stay at home. The proposals also included measures to ban Londoners from going beyond the M under a city-wide lockdownthere is a flare-up of the virus in the capital.Mr Jenrick said any fresh restrictions were unlikely to apply wholesale, adding: We dont want to do anything that is a blanket approach across the country.Our strategy is to manage this in a localised way with targeted action as weve done in Leicester, as were doing now in the north-west.We will follow the data and look at optionswe have to but that approach is the way we restrict in certain areas - it is dficult for those who live there but it provides greater freedom for the rest of the country, for businesses to reopen and for people to get on with their daily lives, and that has to be the way forwardwe can.The Governments scientic advisory group for emergencies - or Sage - have warned there needs to be sufficient headroom in the rate of Covid- infections in order for schools to reopen safely.And it even said the hospitality sector may have to take the hit to reduce the risk of transmission in society. Telling ministers that pubs and restaurants may have to close at the end of the summer, the scientists said: It is important to ensure that there will be enough room in terms of the epidemic to open schools in September... there is a strong case for prioritising opening schools over other establishments.  But the minutes said the evidence still pointed to there being a low risk of transmission in schools. The documents said: Regarding reopening of schools, Sage reiterated its advice that there is a low risk to children’s health from Covid- and signicant harms from schools being closed.Reopening requires sufficient headroom in terms of overall infection rates and numbers, and clear communication with parents and teachers.There may be a need to change measures at the end of the summer in order to be able to keep R below  whilst proceeding with the planned reopening of schools.Planning for safe full reopening should take place now and should take account of the health benefits of reopening schools as well as the educational benefits.It comes after virus cases in the UK more than doubled in just two weeks.Speaking on Friday Prof Whitty warned that measures will have to be taken to stop infections spiraling further.He said: We either say, Actually, weve probably taken this to the limit, weve got to stop now and we may have to pull back a bit to keep this under control, or we do not. If we do pull back, then we should be able to hold the line, andwe do not pull back and we start having further interactions, then we can expect to see an increase in cases with all the consequences that go with that.And Sir Jeremy Farrar, Chair of the Wellcome Trust, said reopening schools was about “choices and trade-offs” that would include workplaces, public transport, pubs and “many others”.It comes as Boris Johnson declared that reopening schools was a “national priority” - and vowed to do all it takes to meet the Government’s promise of getting all kids back to school in September.Standing by his pledge to get kids back in the classroom, Boris said: “That is a good thing, and should be a national priority, and something we aim to deliver.“It’s the right thing for children, they can be educated in a safe Covid-secure way.We should be getting them back to school.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This virus should be treated more like a plague, or a war.What is more important – the tourist board getting a bit of money, or people’s lives Another local added: Really scary seeing that Cornwall is actually busier than usual summers but we arent being locked down.Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged Brits to enjoy staycations in the UK as summer holidays took a blow amid rising case counts in Europe.Cornwall relies on tourism - and the sector contributes millions of pounds to its economy every year.Yesterday, mercury hit .C in London - making it the third-hottest day in the UK ever as Brits swarmed beaches along the coast.However, with highs of C expected next weekend, the crowds in Cornwall dont seem to be going anywhere anytime soon.Royden Paynter, harbour master at Mousehole, said: Suddenly weve been hit with a stampede.Everybody is a bit more stressed this year - they dont move out of your way.It comes as an extra £, was given to Devon and Cornwall Police in July to help the community manage the pandemic this summer.Malcolm Bell, CEO of Visit Cornwall, said that the tourist board is trying to strike a delicate balance between keeping people safe, and rebuilding Cornwalls tourism sector.He said: Ive been keeping an eye on lots of places, and its certainly been busy. For locals it probably feels very busy.It probably seems quite daunting for locals becauseyoure at street level, walking along in a crowd and looking straight ahead, you cant really tell that theres social distancing going on ahead of you.Butyou look at it from above, you can see that people actually are keeping apart.Mr Johnson has insisted the UK is taking every reasonable step to prepare for a surge in virus cases - and some lockdown easing measures have been slowed down.The PM said he was squeezing the brake pedal after the number of cases in the UK has begun to creep up - with  new cases on July , the highest since the end of June.He had been keen to try get le back to normal as shops and pubs reopened while people were urged to get back to work following three months of lockdown first introduced in March.The UKs chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance meanwhile has warned of a risk of a new lockdown required come the winter.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I’m completely convinced it really helps.I’ve always had hay fever, although for years I had terrible sinus trouble that often left me with debilitating headaches, so I chalked it up to that.Five years ago Al was diagnosed with chronic sinusitis. He had corrective surgery and his surgeon said he could tell he was a hay fever sufferer, but said his symptoms may have been shielded due to the issues with his sinuses. Sadly he was right, the headaches disappeared, but the following spring my eyes itched and streamed, I was sneezing and coughing and I completely lost my voice - a real blow as I sing a lot as a hobby.I was fed up feeling so awful so started to do some research, which is how I stumbled upon the nettle theory.Its the idea being that by stinging yourself you force a natural histamine reaction, effectively normalising it in your body which means it then has a lesser histamine reaction when the pollen comes in.I thought I had nothing to lose, so took myself out and ran my forearms along a bank of nettles in a local park.After this Al said he developed a rash which itched for  hours. The next few times he decided to sting himself, he said it wasnt so bad.Over time the stinging results in little more than just a few bumps and little mild itching which only lasts ten minutes or so.I have done it every year since as soon as the nettles appear in spring.It’s made a huge dference: don’t lose my voice anymore – I’m not sneezing all the time and my eyes aren’t running. It may not be for everyone – but it works for me.Since the beginning of March many hay fever sufferers have been told to keep an eye on their symptoms as many can be similar to the coronavirus.Clinical care dietician Kimberly Burton didnt have hay fever when she was younger and said it came out of nowhere in her early s.The -year-old from Nottingham said that over the years her symptoms got worse and led her to visit her GP.She said the condition has even had an impact on her job and added that sometimes her eyes are so puffy that people think she has a black eye.So I’m used to all the symptoms – but this year, about a month ago, I woke up to find my sense of taste had disappeared overnight – something the government had recently said was a recognised symptom of Covid-. I rang  – who said as this was a clear symptom the guidance was I would need to get tested.I was really worried. Part of me was still convinced it was hay fever, but then I spoke to a friend who had also lost her sense of taste, thought it was hay fever then tested positive for the coronavirus.As a health worker Kimberly said it was pretty straightforward for her to get a test and the results came back the next day and were thankfully negative.Now though I’m worried thatI lose my sense of taste again – which I may well do,this is a new symptom I’ve developed – then I am going to have to have a Covid- test every time, she added.While Kimberly only developed hay fever later on in le, one woman says it was motherhood that spurred on her symptoms.Hannah Boothby is mum to eight-year-old Tyler and Emmett, .The -year-old from Milton Keynes said that within weeks of giving birth to her second child Emmett, she started sneezing horrendously and developed really itchy eyes and a scratchy sore throat.Hannah put it down to post birth fatigued and hormones and her health adviser at the time agreed that this was likely the case.. AntihistaminesAntihistamine tablets, capsules and sprays can relieve most hay fever symptoms – sneezing, itchy, runny eyes, skin irritation, itchy nose and throat – but are less effective for nasal congestion.Although strong antihistamines can be prescribed by a GP, most people buy antihistamines over the counter in a pharmacy.These usually contain either Cetirizine or Loratadine. If one doesn’t work for you, you can try the other one.Some contain chlorphenamine and these are more liable to make you drowsy. All antihistamines can make you drowsy and it is illegal to drivethey do. It is also dangerous to operate machinery.. Steroid nasal spraysSteroid nasal sprays help reduce inflammation in the nose.They work best for clearing nasal symptoms – itching, sneezing, watering and congestion – although sprays sometimes clear eye symptoms too.Again, look for the active ingredients - beclomethasone, budesonide, fluticasone or mometasone – own brand versions can be cheaper.. Allergen barrier balmsOrganic drug-free allergen barrier balms such as HayMax are applied to the nostrils and bones of the eyes in the morning and throughout the day.They are used to stop allergens from entering the body through the nose.They are especially useful as they can be used immediately, together with other hay fever products and are suitable for children and pregnant and breastfeeding women.”. Immune supportTaking products that can help boost your immune system can be useful.Bee Prepared Daily Defence Immune Support is an immune boosting wellness formula for adults and children that contains all natural ingredients which have a history of benefits and clinically researched actions which help support the immune system.Please note that this product isn’t suitable for pregnant or breastfeeding mums.. Acupressure bandsAcupressure is a non-invasive form of acupuncture, achieved by applying physical pressure of hands, elbows, feet or devices to the same acupuncture points.It is used in a wide iety of conditions including hay fever. The Qu-Chi Hay Fever Band uses acupressure to target key pressure points on the body associated with allergy symptoms.The band is worn on one of these pressure points, the elbow. Adult and child sizes are available. This product is not suitable for pregnant womenIt didn’t even occur to me it could be hay fever – even though my husband Joel, who has had it since he was a boy, kept telling me I had all the symptoms.I stuck to my guns – as far as I saw it I didn’t suffer from allergies and I was just run down from the sleepless nights of being a new mum.She said after a few weeks her symptoms became similar to her husbands and he suggested that she try one of his anti histamines.Hannah said that this made a big dference.Grudgingly I had to accept that I had hay fever after all – and the only thing that had changed in my le in the last few months was having a baby.I was so intrigued that I googled whether giving birth can give you hay fever and found there while there is nothing conclusive out there were quite a few other mums who had experienced the same thing.Either way, it seems to me to be too much of a coincidence – and I can’t help wondering whether the fact that Emmett has a cow’s milk allergy is somehow linked.She said the itchy eyes are the worst part and said to soothe them she sometimes put cold chamomile tea bags on her eyes that she has kept in the fridge over night.It’s annoying, but it’s a small price to pay for having my lovely boy, she added.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It first ruled against masks in May and has re-evaluated the evidence several times, including again last week.However Dutch residents must still wear face coverings on public transport.Christian Hoebe, a professor of infectious diseases in Maastricht and member of the advisory team, said: Face masks should not be seen as a magic bullet that halts the spread. The evidence for them is contradictory. In general, we think you must be careful with face masks because they can give a  sense of security. People think theyre immune from disease or stop social distancing. That is very negative.It puts the Netherlands at odds with most other countries in the world.Even US President Donald Trump has since done an about-turn and urged Americans to wear face masks, saying it was patriotic to do so .In the UK, face masks have been compulsory on public transport from June  and in shops and supermarkets from July .From August  they will also be required in places you come into contact with people you do not normally meet, such as museums, galleries, cinemas and places of worship.The science around wearing a face covering has changed during the pandemic.At the outset, the World Health Organisation said healthy people did not need to wear a mask, unless they were caring for someone who was sick.Then in April, the WHO said masks could prove useful. Shortly thereafter, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control issued new recommendations, signalling increased support for masks. Finally, in June, the WHO said they should be worn in public places where social distancing is not possible to help stop the spread of coronavirus.

Government ministers have been warned that the plastic face visors worn by hairdressers leaves a gap that airborne coronvirus droplets could pass through. They are now facing calls to revise guidance to barbers and hairdressers and require them to wear face masks, as well as the visors. Scientists are said to have raised the concerns in the latest meeting of The New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Groupon Friday.The issues was also discussed in a recent meeting of at least one sub-committee of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , the Dailyreports.Prof Mark Wilcox, a professor of medical microbiology who attends Sage and two of its sub committees, said: I donapost think the guidance is correct and I donapost understand why visors were chosen in preference to masks. We have, in several settings, discussed the issue of masks versus visors and I think it would be fair to say that I am not alone in these views. My colleagues both in those settings and in other settings share my views. Iaposve not come across somebody who has said that visors are the best thing. Dr Ben Killingley, a consultant in infectious diseases who sits on Nervtag, said: I donapost know where it came from, where someone decided that just wearing a visor for hairdressers alone would be enough. That doesnapost make sense to me. A visor is primarily worn to protect workers from splashes. It does the same job as goggles, protecting the eyes. No healthcare worker would ever wear a visor without a mask. You would have thought for their own protection and just in case they have been infected themselves, they should be wearing a mask themselves. In my view, both to protect the hairdresser and the person coming in, just wearing a visor alone is not enough. Professor Peter Openshaw, a member of Nervtag, tweeted his concerns, after a haircut by a barber wearing a face shield. His expelled breath and droplets were directed down onto me, Prof Openshaw tweeted. Zero protection, Iaposd say. He added that while his own mask provided protection against possible viral droplets, it would have failed to prevent corneal seeding, where Covid- particles enter the eyes.The concerns come after SAGE said it could not be confident that the crucial coronavirus aposRapos rate is currently below one in England. Boris Johnson  on Friday paused the easing of lockdown as fears grow that a surge of cases in some areas of northern England could turn into a second wave.Towns in Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and West Yorkshire have been slapped with fresh restrictions with social gatherings banned indoors and in private gardens. Meanwhile, ministers have been warned by experts that trade-offs, such as the closing of pubs, could be needed for schools to fully reopen in September.

You can’t visit a neighbour in their house, but you can sit near them in a pub. Soyou want to see their house they have to call it The Grape and Flamingo and charge you £ for a bowl of chilli. Then you can sit in there with a pile of strangers, which is much safer. The lockdown announcements are like the instructions for a s game show: “You can only mix with six people in your bubble, who can only be in one other bubble or a ‘bubblette’ of five people you’ve never heard of, who must live in your kitchen unless you play the Joker. “Then you can shout, ‘I’m getting me eyes tested’ and ignore all the rules for  seconds until you hear this noise: WAAAWAAKERCHINGLE. Then you must climb the ladder to the self-isolation unit and shout ‘Coronavirus’ to win this magnicent set of carving knives.” In designated towns deemed high-risk, such as Oldham, you will still be allowed into pubs, but must wear a mask at all times. So you will be permitted to buy alcohol, but you must pour it down your front, at no time removing the mask to put any drink in your mouth. If you are in a lockdown area you have to comply with extra restrictions – unless you leave the lockdown area illegally to go to a non-lockdown area, which is perfectly legal.  This follows clear guidelines from the Government all along, that it’s fine to shake hands with infected people as long as you don’t touch them in any way.Then we were told masks make no dference, which must be why it’s now the law to wear them, as the only waywe can defeat the virus is by making no dference.So maybe the reason they changed their mind is it’s a fetish of Dominic Raab’s. His next statement will be: “Our scientists advise we must all wear knee-high boots and nipple clamps.” There are rules for pubs and cafés about music and talking too loudly. There’s probably one that you can’t use words starting with P as that makes you spit out virus germs, but you can say “pharmacy as it’s a silent P. It’s best to check with the police first, but you mustn’t call them “police” as that starts with P so you must refer to them as “constabulary” or “filth” but not “pigs”. To make sure everyone understood the new rules for Manchester, they were announced at pm on Twitter. That’s how to ensure everything is followed clearly.

Boris Johnson on Friday paused the easing of lockdown as fears grow that a surge of cases in some areas of northern England could turn into a second wave. Towns in Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and West Yorkshire have been slapped with fresh restrictions with social gatherings banned indoors and in private gardens. Meanwhile, ministers have been warned by experts that trade-offs, such as the closing of pubs, could be needed for schools to fully reopen in September. And it is reported by the Sundayand Sunday Times that a radical blueprint to avoid a second lockdown, something the prime minister recently likened to the nuclear deterrent, has been drawn up. The elderly and vulnerable could be asked once again to stay at home to enable the younger, less susceptible people to continue working while keeping death rates low. Part of the enhanced or dferential shielding plans could be to have exclusive weekly slots for the elderly to visit shops and access services. A city-wide lockdown on London is also reportedly being considered, with restrictions on travel in and out of the M in the event of a spike of cases in the capital. The Sunday Times said Mr Johnson held a war game session with Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Wednesday to run through possible options for averting another nationwide lockdown that could stall any potential economic recovery.  Meanwhile tightening quarantine restrictions on those flying into the UK and “harder” local lockdowns than the restrictions imposed last week are all under consideration. The change in tone from the government comes after a small uptick in coronavirus cases nationally over the last few weeks in the UK. Just a few weeks ago, Mr Johnson was speaking of ato normality by Christmas. But since then he spoke of signs of a second wave in Europe, with daily cases back over , in Spain, prompting the country to be removed from the UKaposs quarantine-free travel list. A senior Whitehall source told the : “We are hopeful that fast action, regional lockdowns and quarantines will stop the need for any more substantive action.  However we prepare for all scenarios, and officials are currently drawing up an array of policy options to present to the Prime Minister.” The blueprint to avoid another lockdown comes after people shielding were finally freed from the shackles for the first time on Saturday. In Wales, the advice remains in place until August . The enhanced shielding plans may include more people, based on ages and risk factors identied since March. It could even see those aged between  and  given personalised risk ratings, said the Times It is believed that encouraging “shielding afternoons” or “shielding hours” for the most vulnerable to access shops and services is part of the plans.

Ministers will unveil a complete overhaul this week of Englandaposs system that has been in place for  years in a bid to speed up new homes. Instead of residents being able to fight every inidual scheme from scratch, councils will ide land into three categories in advance. In the most liberal “growth” zone, developers will automatically have permission “in principle” to build homes, hospitals, schools, shops and offices. Sources say specics will still need approval, including complying with a design code, but the question will no longer be whether a scheme should be built at all in those areas.  There will also be a “permission in principle approach” in the second type of zone, “renewal”. Development will then be restricted in the third type of zone, “protected”, which will include the green belt and areas of outstanding natural beauty. A consultation this week is also expected to suggest ending letters to every resident likely to be affected by a scheme. Instead there will be a move towards online notications. Notices would also no longer appear on lamp posts. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick claimed the current system is a “barrier to building homes” and the changes will “cut red tape, not standards” - while speeding up vital new homes. Mr Jenrick also said there will be a “legal requirement to have tree-lined streets for all new developments”.  But council chiefs sounded the alarm. Local Government Association chairman James Jamieson said: “It is vital that any reforms provide the right protections so residents have the power to shape the area they live in. “Any suggestion that planning is a barrier to housebuilding is a myth. Nine in  planning applications are approved by councils, while more than a million homes given planning permission in the last decade have not yet been built. Mark Crane of the District Councils’ Network said new homes are desperately needed, but added: We cannot compromise on the quality of new homes and places and sideline public consultation, which we fear will be the consequence of the reforms. Shelter chief executive Polly Neate said: Instead of getting England building faster, major changes to the planning system could actually slow England down. Housebuilders risk facing uncertainty as they scramble to understand the new system and what it means for their plans - just as the construction industry is facing a huge economic downturn. In fact, it could even inadvertently put the frighteners on developers building new homes. Planning permission is not what is stopping England from getting high-quality, genuinely affordable homes - a lack of Government investment is. It comes days after a report for the government found previous Tory “red tape” cutting led to homes as small as  square metres. The study of “permitted development” homes, which can be built as part by converting office blocks, found just % would meet national space standards and  had no windows at all.  Mr Jamieson said: “The Government’s own independent report warned of the worse quality of homes not delivered through the planning system. “We urge the Government to heed these warnings and not further side-line the planning process.” The new system will ide up land through “local plans” drawn up by councils every few years. It’s understood some town halls may be forced to rip up their plans and redraw them to the new guidelines. Government sources said there will be “appropriate transition arrangements” for councils that have recently drawn up their local plan."},{"url":null,"title":"unite chief len mccluskey sounds","story":"NewsUnite chief Len McCluskey sounds warning over future donations to LabourThe Unite general secretary said the unions financial support would no doubt be reviewed after a row over the partys apology to anti-Semitism whistleblowersShareCommentsByPatrick Daly:,  AUG NewsLen McCluskey said the unions financial support would no doubt be reviewed \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"What is really going on in politics  Get our daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Mr McCluskey, an ally of former leader Jeremy Corbyn, said the payouts were an abuse of membersapos money.He told the paper: A lot of it is Uniteaposs money and Iaposm already being asked all kinds of questions by my executive. Itaposs as though a huge sign has been put up outside the Labour party with aposqueue here with your writ and get your payment over thereapos. Under Mr Corbynaposs leadership, the party was dogged with allegations that it had failed to take action over members accused of promoting anti-Semitism. Seven former employees from the partyaposs governance and legal unit, who were responsible for the investigation of allegations of misconduct by party members, sued Labour after it issued a press release describing them as having personal and political axes to grind. The legal action followed the broadcast in July  of a BBC Panorama programme titled Is Labour Anti-Semitic . Labouraposs barrister said in court: The Labour Party acknowledges that these claims about the claimants are untrue, and we retract and withdraw them and undertake not to repeat them.  The party has refused to disclose how much the settlement would end up costing, but thereported that fees and damages were likely to amount to nearly £,. Sir Keiraposs predecessor Mr Corbyn called the decision to settle disappointing and claimed it was a political decision, not a legal one. Mr Corybn said his team was advised while he was leader that the party had a strong defence. Panorama reporter John Ware is taking legal action against the Islington North MP following the remarks. Labour declined to comment on Mr McCluskeyaposs donation review threat, but Sir Keiraposs spokesman previously said all three candidates in the final of the partyaposs leadership contest, which concluded in April, had agreed they wanted to see the case settled.

Englandaposs schools will aposdefinitelyapos reopen Ministers have insisted Englandaposs schools will definitely reopen to all pupils in September, full-time - despite fears of a second wave of coronavirus.Boris Johnson delayed plans to resume bowling alleys, casinos, skating rinks, wedding receptions and some beauty treatments from August  due to the spike. That sudden wave of caution led teaching unions to question plans to get all kids back in the classroom. Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, called for greater clarity, as well as sufficient time to review and,necessary, adjust reopening plans. But Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick today said schools will definitely reopen fully in September. We need to get all of our kids back to school, he told Times Radio. Getting our children back into the classroom with that direct, face-to-face contact with their teachers will be a priority for the government when we have to make those tough choices.That means other things may have to close The most important two words from Robert Jenrick are these: Tough choices.Scientists have warned you canapost reopen everything in societyandkeep Covid- under control.Opening schools, even with social distancing in place, will mean more contact between people - and more risk.A paper produced by SAGE experts on May  warned of a rapid exponential increase in coronavirus in a scenario where all childrento school.Yet even without schools open, cases already appear to have been rising since lockdown was eased on July . That means the government may have to choose what new restrictions to put in place in exchange for opening the classroom. Englandaposs Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned on Friday: If we wish to do more things in the future, we may have to do less of some other things. The question is - what do we do less of   Ministers insist they donapost want to shut pubs Scientists have speculated pubs and restaurants could among venues to shut in order to keep schools open. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick today insisted: We don’t have any plans to do that. Instead, he said, the government will focus where it can on imposing local restrictions rather than national ones. ... But the government canapost rule it out While Boris Johnson obviously doesnapost want to do it, Mr Jenrick refused to rule out the prospect of shutting pubs or restaurants nationally. Instead he said there were no plans to do so.  Boris Johnson really, really doesnapost want a second national lockdown Boris Johnson is desperate to avoid a second full, national lockdown that would cripple the economy. He said on July : It is like a nuclear deterrent, I certainly donapost want to use it. And nor do I think we will be in that position again. Instead, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said ministers are trying to aim only for local restrictions. He pointed to parts of Greater Manchester, Lancashire, West Yorkshire, Leicester and Luton which already have criss-crossing restrictions in place. Mr Jenrick said: We don’t want to do anything that’s a blanket approach across the country. Our strategy is to manage this in a localised way with targeted action as we’ve done in Leicester, as we’re doing now in the North West. ... But he canapost rule out the aposnuclearapos option The fact is, just like the nuclear deterrent, a full national lockdown has to remain in the PMaposs arsenal. And for the same reason he canapost totally rule out shutting pubs or restaurants to keep schools open nationwide. Robert Jenrick today saidwe need to go further weaposll have to, adding: If the rate of infection rises then obviously weaposll have to take further action as well. Drastic proposals include telling millions of over-s to stay at home  If there do have to be national restrictions, todayaposs Sundaygives a drastic peek at what they could look like. The newspaper reported four options which are reportedly under consideration, in order to avoid a fullto telling the nation to stay at home. The most eye-popping would involve telling millions of people over  to effectively shield in their homes - joining .million other people for whom shielding ended on August . The previous shielding list, now paused in all but a few areas, chose people by medical condition not age. According to the Sunday Times, those aged between  and  given personalised risk ratings, and asked to add to the ranks of those staying at home. Robert Jenrick insisted the idea was not being actively considered and said it was speculation. No sources also called the reports speculative. But Mr Jenrick also refused to rule it out in future, saying: You would expect the government to be considering all of the range of options that might be available to us. And it was always the case that the .million original shielders are only paused - not released forever. Some or all of them could be asked to shield again. The second idea is said to be giving vulnerable people certain times of the week to go out shopping, so they donapost come into contact with as many others. Non-essential travel in and out of London could be halted  The third idea featured in the Sundayis said to be imposing a citywide lockdown on London. In Leicester, the government advised against non-essential travel in and out of the city to contain a local spike. So far Londonaposs million residents have been spared a second major outbreak, butit does happen it could be disastrous. The idea is said to be stopping travel to and fro across the M. Again, No sources described this as speculation and Mr Jenrick said: There’s no plan, as far as I’m aware, to do anything broader in London. There could be harder local lockdowns  The fourth and final idea trailed in the Sundaylooks most in line with ministersapos current thinking. There could be harder local restrictions to curb the spread of the virus - something weaposve seen already. Restrictions are already in place in parts of Greater Manchester, Lancashire, West Yorkshire, Leicester and Luton. And a string of other areas are now on Public Health Englandaposs watchlist of rising infection rates, suggesting theyaposll be nextthings get worse. The areas of concern are Eden , Sandwell, Northampton , Peterborough, Rotherham and Wakefield. Meanwhile, a regional ban on two households meeting indoors could be extended Separately to the four optionsare reports that contact between households could be limited further. Current guidance for most of England says up to two households, of an unlimited number of people, can meet indoors as long as thereaposs social distancing. But in parts of Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshire, people are now banned from meeting any other household indoors - or in private gardens. In the North West and West Yorkshire, the ban on indoor meetings will be law with £ fines for breaking it. But it doesnapost exist in the rest of the country. And in the rest of England, the only actual law is against gatherings of more than  people. Multiple reports today suggest the indoor meetings ban could be extended nationwide. The government has not commented on the claims. But crucially, none of this is decided yet The government is at pains to stress that none of these measures have been decided. They are all plans being looked at - they are certainly not things that are definitely going to happen. The government faces an impossible choice - and we donapost yet know what it will choose "},{"url":null,"title":"who can go back work","story":"NewsWho can go back to work this week  How work from home rules changed on August Big changes have come in for millions of workers in England whove been stuck at home since March.

For months, people have been working at home in kitchens, living rooms and bedrooms due to the threat of coronavirus. But from this week, firms can for the first time ask people to come into the office, evenitaposs not absolutely necessary for them to be there. It will be a wave of relief for many cooped up at home - and for the workers in stricken city-centre pubs. But for others it will be a time of great worry as they juggle childcare, health issues and worries about a second wave of coronavirus. And it comes despite the Prime Minister dramatically halting a string of other measures to open up society on Friday.The government has so far failed to guarantee a legal right to work from home - meaning itaposll have to be a conversation you have with your employer. Here are all your questions answered as the rules change in England. What is the guidance right now  The current guidance for England is thatyou can work from home, you should work from home. If you canapost do your job from home, you are advised to go back into your workplacepossible. In , your boss should make your workplace aposCovid-secureapos to reduce the risk of transmission. This means lots of things but can include extra cleaning, seating people further apart, and putting up screens and floor markings. Detailed guides for each type of workplace are here. The exception isyouaposre aposshieldingapos due to being extremely clinically vulnerable to Covid-. If youaposre shielding, you should still work from home or -your employer wonapost pay you - claim Statutory Sick Pay. What changed on August    Instead of the government telling everyone who can work from home to do so, firms now get to decide who comes into the workplace. Announcing the change, Boris Johnson said: We are going to give employers more discretion. That could mean of course continuing to work from home, which is one way of working safely and which has worked for many employers and employees. Or it could mean making workplaces safe by following Covid Secure guidelines. Shielding also ended on August  - more of this below - so many of those .million people will be asked to go back to the workplace at the same time. Why have things changed   Boris Johnson announced the change amid growing fears city centre economies will grind to a halt. Sandwich shops, pubs and restaurants face going bankruptworkers are kept away completely - and with them will go thousands of staff. Coronavirus rates had also been falling steadily before the PMaposs announcement on July , though there have been a number of local outbreaks since. And there is - at least in theory - a decent Test and Trace system in place meaning any office outbreaks can be detected quickly. However, the change isnapost without controversy. The PMaposs own Chief Scientic Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance warned on July : We are still at a time when distancing measures are important. Of the ious distancing measures, working from home remains a perfectly good option for many companies because it is easy to do. A number of companies do not think it is detrimental to productivity, and in that situation I see absolutely no reason to change it. Should I take public transport   People are asked to take alternative means to get to workthey can - walking, cycling or even driving. But people may also now use public transport for non-essential journeys, even though they are encouraged to use other optionspossible. So yes, you may use public transport to get to work. Though you will need to wear a face covering and are advised to avoid rush hourpossible. Can I still work from homeI want   If you can do your job perfectly well from home, you should make that argument to your boss. The government is not ordering everyone to go back to work. Instead, it is saying everyone can go back. In reality, many offices will have far lower capacity than before so many companies are likely to still have some staff working from home. However, ultimately this is a decision for your firm. The big dference is that from August , there is no government rule on keeping you away from HQ - itaposs a conversation you have to have with your boss.  No one can physically force you to go into an office, butyou want to keep your job, the answer is essentially yes. As long as the workplace is safe, employers can ask people toto work. Ministers have said theyaposll consider a legal right to work from home, but one does not currently exist. Thereaposs a legal right to request flexible working - but your company only has to engage with the request in a reasonable way. They donapost have to grant it. The government says firms should consult closely with their employees on what they decide. But Acas says: If someone refuses to attend work without a valid reason, it could result in disciplinary action. Itaposs a slightly dferent kettle of fishthe workplace is unsafe - more on this below.  Can my boss force me to go backitaposs not safe  No -your workplace is not aposCovid-secureapos, your firm should not be asking you back. However, critics say there is no easy redress for workers who believe bosses are breaking the rules. Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman urged firms to take socially responsible” decisions, adding: We’re not prescribing what businesses should do, provided that they make the environment safe. Rogue firms can be reported to the Health and Safety Executive, or workers could bring a complaint or go to arbitration service Acas. And employment lawyer Matt Gingell suggested such issues could end up at an employment tribunal. These can all be y processes which take many months to resolve. He said: If an employee refuses toto the workplace due to the employee reasonably believing imminent and serious danger and is then dismissed for that reason the employee could, depending on the circumstances, have a claim for unfair dismissal. The requirement that the employee has to believe that there is imminent and serious danger, does limit the right. WhatIaposm pregnant or have asthma   If you are pregnant or have asthma, diabetes, heart disease or liver disease, you are classed as clinically vulnerable. This means you are not sick enough to be shielding, but that you are at a higher risk from Covid-. If you fall into this category, you can still go back to work where possible. However, you should take extra care in observing social distancing. If you can work from home, your employer should help you to do so. If you canapost work from home, you should be offered the safest available on-site roles, enabling you to stay  metres away from others. This could mean being placed in a dferent role. If you canapost stay two metres from others, your employer should assess whether this involves an acceptable level of risk. If unacceptable risks cannot be removed, pregnant women are entitled to be suspended on full pay. A full list of conditions for the clinically vulnerable group is here. WhatI have children   There is no extra childcare help that came with the back to work order - despite it starting just as the summer holidays got under way. Parents of the youngest children can get up to  hours a week of free childcare, and schools are being encouraged to run catch-up schemes. Parents are also entitled to up to four weeks per year of parental leave for each child - but this is unpaid. It is also capped at  weeks for each child between birth and their th birthday. Labouraposs Keir Starmer has said the Prime Minister is putting parents in an “impossible position”. He said: Despite ordering millions of parents back to the office, the Prime Minister has refused to provide any extra help for families, penalising parents by putting them in an impossible position. “Parents got a back-to-work notice just as the summer holidays began. But they got no support for structured activities, no summer catch-up schemes, and no support for a childcare sector on its knees. WhatIaposve been shielding   Shielding for .million extremely clinically vulnerable people ended in England on August . There are some exceptions to thisthere is a local outbreak in your area. Please check with your local council or this government web page. If you have been shielding, the government advises that you canto work from August  -you canapost work from home. However, you should adopt strict social distancing, and remain cautious. WhatIaposm on furlough  Furlough has not ended on August  and continues right up to October . However, it has now started winding down, with firms having to contribute some of the costs of their workers from August . That means firms are likely to take more staff off furlough or - in the worst-case scenario - make them redundant. This is a conversation you should have with your employer. No new staff can be put on furlough - butyou were furloughed previously, you can be re-furloughed. Again, this is a conversation to have with your boss.

But a prank played on -year-old Ruth Poniarski at college was far too serious to shrug off the next day. It almost destroyed her. It was back in  when high-flying Ruth, then studying for an architecture degree, went to a small end of term party. ‘It wasn’t a wild affair, there were only about eight others there, all architecture graduates and physics PhD students,’ says Ruth, now .‘People had drunk a little wine but that was it. Everyone was heading home when a so-called friend, Joseph, produced some brownies and told me his professor’s we had made them. I was hungry and didn’t think to question, I just ate it.’What Ruth didn’t realise was the homemade cake had been laced with ‘angel dust’, the nickname for an anaesthetic called PCP, which stops pain but can also cause hallucinations. ‘I’d never heard of the drug before, but it’s an animal tranquilliser,’ she explains. ‘Within minutes I had started to decompensate, which medically means losing the ability to maintain my mental health. aposEveryone had left the party by now, I think Joseph thought it would make me want to have sex with him, but I had no interest in that whatsoever.‘I started hallucinating about being in this cavernous space with white candles everywhere. Then I felt dizzy and started shaking, I wanted to run away and escape out of the window, it was very disorientating.’Desperate to get away, Ruth ended up getting in her car and tried to drive back to her apartment in Long Island, New York. ‘Somehow, I was able to drive a few miles before I pulled over on the highway and began walking. In my head I was convinced there was some kind of revolution going on where Jewish people like me were being persecuted. When I lost my shoes I just carried on walking throughout the night until the sun started coming up.’Confused and bedraggled, Ruth went into a convenience shop where a kind stranger realised she was having a psychotic episode. He drove her home, calmly making small talk all the way to stabilise her during the frightening hallucinations.‘I looked a state, my hair was a mess, my clothes were soiled and I had bare feet. But his intervention that night saved my le.’ Back home, Ruth had to face her father and worried acquaintances – including Joseph. She was taken to a psychiatrist who gave her some medication to help, but it only made her more jittery. Ruth’s terrying drug-induced ‘trip’ lasted almost a week.  Joseph made a weak apology by writing a message inside a book, comparing himself to a stupid, headless character in the story. After he gave that to her, she never heard from him again and didn’t press charges. After her initial breakdown, Ruth was determined to carry on with her studies but struggled with feelings of inadequacy triggered by not having close friends to rely on. Sadly for her, it was to be the first of many mental breakdowns that spiralled into a diagnosis of psychosis, schizophrenia, severe anxiety, and bipolar disorder. Before the brownie incident she had no mental health issues. Every few months she had what she calls ‘an episode’ – mainly suffering in silence.‘No one knew of my breakdowns, I led a lonely le, concealing the truth from the few friends I had. I was afraidmy peers learned of my illness, they would shun me and call me “the crazy woman”. People just didn’t understand mental health back then. ‘It would flare up with no real warning, but social stresses would spur it on, like moving apartments, or when I signed up to a seminar on gaining confidence, I found it just all too much.‘I would go days without sleeping, and twice I didn’t sleep for seven days. I just caved into myself. I tried to study but couldn’t focus, I missed meals, and once slept rough for a night.’Ruth battled to balance a sense of purpose and normality with her trips to hospital. ‘I tried dferent prescribed drugs but back in the s and s they were not as advanced as what’s available today. They made me very jumpy.’ While her parents were loving, they were ill-equipped to deal with Ruth’s issues. In her disturbed mind, she felt they wanted to have her locked up. Ruth’s illness culminated in  when – then aged  – she fell three floors from her apartment window during a manic episode.‘I had bad anxiety and insomnia and the flat next door was renovating, so there was a constant drilling noise which compounded the state I was in.  aposI needed to escape the noise but in my delirious mind I daren’t exit the front door as bad people would get me. So I tied my bed sheets to my kitchen table leg and tried to abseil out of the window.’ From ft in the air Ruth crashed to the ground, breaking her back and both ankles. A neighbour heard the screams and called an ambulance.After an eight-hour operation on her back and a four-hour operation for each of the shattered ankles, Ruth was put into a full-body cast and was kept in intensive care for four days. When she woke up there, she was still in a manic state. ‘I was still delusional, I thought the doctors and nurses were going to kill me. I would be murdered in my bed.’Ruth spent a month in hospital before leaving in a wheelchair, with a doctor warning she might never walk again. But she proved them wrong and by working hard with physical therapy, within six months she was back on her feet, though she still limps today.Ruth also found a better psychiatrist, who took the time to talk to her, as well as involve her family to get to the bottom of what triggered her episodes.‘He was very thorough, he went over my whole background, and included my family in the process. He helped me to organise a support system which is so essential for mental illness,’ explains Ruth. ‘Also, the medication improved over time.’ Realising how ineffective her original psychiatrist had been, Ruth sued him in  for mismanaging her case, and eventually received an out of court settlement. Happily, Ruth’s le was on the up.After the accident she turned her hand to painting, which was more of a passion than architecture had been. She found immersing herself in her art a soothing form of self-expression. In February , she met Richard, two years her senior, through a dating service. ‘After our first date I had a mini episode, so on the second date I barely spoke a word and assumed I’d never hear from him again. When he asked me on a third date I couldn’t believe it. aposBut it was time to open up. I told him everything about the seriousness of my condition. He couldn’t believe my honesty, but he was studying to be a psychiatrist so he understood.’They wed just four months later, and went on to have two children, Douglas, now , and Elizabeth, now . ‘Even when they were teens they never got into using drugs, I think they were very wary, funnily enough!’Between  and  Ruth only had four breakdowns. ‘I always tell my husband I made him a great psychiatrist as he actually lived through my experiences with me.

As restrictions ease, the Very Big Family Le Survey gives a glimpse of how le has changed over the past few months and how families view the “new normal”. The good news is that two thirds of parents of teenagers say all that time spent together at home has had a positive effect on their family. And the same applies to almost three quarters of those with kids under . Many families have created perfect memories by doing new activities together, such as playing board games, baking, walking and cycling.  Watching TV and streaming services have also provided family bonding time. Very asked parents to reflect on the past few months as they prepare for their children toto school full time. While for some it was stressful, juggling work, home schooling and quality time with the family, others found it fun and inspiring. Writer Gemma Cheetham lives with husband Mike and their two children, Ava-Violet, six, and Gabriel, one . She says the lockdown has made it feel like things have slowed down. She explained: For the first few weeks of lockdown I was working from home, and it was a struggle as Gabriel wanted to be with me all the time.  I’d end up logging on to work early in the morning, stopping at pm and starting again in the evening to make up lost hours. Normally, Mike would have taken the kids out, but when the restrictions came in he couldn’t do that. Then I got furloughed, and at first I enjoyed home schooling Ava-Violet and doing practical things like planting in the garden and baking banana bread.  But I started to notice a real dference in her. She just wanted to stay in the house. Even though we reassured her, she’d say things like, ‘I don’t want to go back to school, I want to stay safe and I want my family to stay safe.’ When her village school reopened, and she was in a small class bubble, she went back to her old self straightaway. She was glad to have the routine again, but she still likes having me at home. I feel like le has slowed down and we’ve been able to just appreciate each other’s company more. Another family feeling the benefit of spending more time together are the Blankstones. Mum Lisa and dad Mark live with daughter Olivia,  .  Estate agent Lisa told us: Olivia was due to sit her GCSEs and obviously she was upset when they were cancelled but since then she’s enjoyed being able to just chill out. I was furloughed, and Mark has his own optician’s which closed temporarily, so we were all at home. Olivia had schoolwork at first, but that eased off so we had lots of free time. We walked every day, exercised at home doing Joe Wicks and David Lloyd sessions. Olivia kept in touch with friends via video chats, and although she said a few times she wished she could see them properly, she was fine. She was disappointed to have our holiday cancelled, but she’s going to college and she’ll be more than ready to have some normality back again by September. We all get on well, so the biggest challenge for us was not being able to see other members of the family. Because he runs his own business, Mark said he’s never spent so much time with Olivia and he’s loved that. When you’re busy you feel like you’re always chasing your tail, but lockdown meant we all had more time.

Andy Calvert has been in the same spot outside a house in Stonehouse, Lanarkshire, occupied by Cameron Weir, , and his mum Sheila, . Cameron and Sheila claim a wood burner used by the -year-old ex-soldier causes fumes to pour into their house and back garden. It was originally thought that the council was powerless to intervene because the van sat on an unadopted road, reports the Daily Record. The family have now been informed by the local authority that it does own the land. However, officials say due to  Covid- restrictions  they can’t monitor the site to determineAndy is causing a nuisance. Cameron said: “For so long we were told it was an unadopted road that the council didn’t own. “The council have finally admitted that it is theirs and they have the authority to move Andy. “Then we were told they couldn’t act because of the  Covid restrictions  – but they could have acted long before now. “It’s incredibly frustrating.” Andy, who has been parked in his spot since August , blamed the council for his  housing issues  and said he would not be moving. He added: “This started when the council evicted me from my flat because I fell behind on rent.I had nowhere to go but my van.  “I have nothing against Cameron or Sheila. “ButI take a flat the council offer, I’ll be back to square one with all the outstanding arrears from the last flat to pay.So until the council can offer me help, I’m not going anywhere.” Long-distance lorry driver Andy has kitted out his van with a double bed, a TV, a fridge and wood ling for insulation. He uses a gas ring to cook, has a chemical toilet and showers at work. Andy admitted the wood burner he bought for £ from eBay was “smokey at first” but claims it is better now."},{"url":null,"title":"grans manicure saved life after","story":"NewsGrans manicure saved her le after technician spotted lung cancer from her nailsJoan Martindale, , has thanked her nail technician who advised her to seek medical help after noticing her nails had began to bend over and recognised it as a possible health scareShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  AUG NewsJoan with her daughter Lindsay Edwards \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Joan Martindale had noticed her fingernails and toenails were getting wider and starting to curve earlier this year, and despite Googling the symptoms that hinted it could be a sign of heart or lung disease, she brushed off the concerns. But when the -year-old visited her manicurist of ten years Linda Bartram, the technician noticed the change in her clientaposs nails and urged her to get it checked out. Retired craft shop assistant Joan took the advice and doctors quickly diagnosed her with squamous cell carcinoma, carrying out a five-hour operation to remove a mm tumour from her lung. Joan, who is currently undergoing chemotherapy, shared her story to raise awareness of the symptom which could help with early diagnosis. Going for a manicure saved my le, said Joan, from Tutbury, Staffordshire. It was incredible she could pick it up from just looking at my nails. Iaposve told her I shall be eternally grateful to her, when weaposve got rid of this COVID weaposre going for a big slap-up meal. Joan, who previously smoked   cigarettes a day before switching to vaping in , first experienced unusual symptoms around Christmas, when her ankles and feet began to swell. I went to the doctors and they said it was water retention, they gave me some tablets but they didnapost do anything. Then I noticed my toenails got wide and bulbous on my big toes. I donapost usually look on Google but I was curious and it said it could be something to do with heart or lung cancer.Touch wood, for my age, the doctors have said Iaposm in good health so I did think aposoh no itaposs not me, Iaposll wait a little bit longerapos. Then when I went to have my nails done in March Linda askedI was alright. I mentioned the swelling in my ankles and then she said she didnapost want to upset me, but that she thought there was something wrong with my nails and that they needed to be looked at by a doctor. After her appointment with a GP led to a series of scans, Joan discovered she had a tumour on the top right lobe of one of her lungs.  Glenfield Hospital in Leicester carried out an operation to remove the tumour and Joan also had lymph nodes removed that came back clear, which she hopes is a sign the cancer hasnapost spread further.The gran-of-two says despite the scary diagnosis she feels lucky it was caught and treated, especially during the coronavirus lockdown.Joan said: Iaposve got such a positive attitude and I kept thinking aposIaposve got to go through all this because I want to see my grandchildren grow upapos. Iaposve always been an optimist and just keep thinking Iaposve been so lucky for it to be diagnosed and all sorted so quickly. It was a bit rough lying for five hours on my side with my arms stretched above my head, but the surgeon and the team were absolutely brilliant.  Iaposm just keeping my fingers crossed now that itaposs gone away. I havenapost vaped since the operation. She added that she may have gone to the doctors to discuss the change in her nails at some point, but credited Linda for raising it as a real red flag. This symptom needs to be known about so conditions can be diagnosed early - the more people know about it the better, she added. Beauty therapist and nail technician Linda Bartram said she was shocked by the change in Joanaposs nails in the course of a month. She said: At Joanaposs previous appointment I had noticed her nails were starting to just slightly bend over.

A close pal of Christian Brueckner, , claims the German told him he had stripped naked outside first – and only fled when one of the teens woke up in terror and started to wake the others. The friend broke his silence about the alleged incident after seeing this week’s police searches. Dozens of officers descended on an allotment Brueckner used to rent in Hanover on Tuesday.They excavated the site, using snfer dogs, ground penetrating radar and drones.  They apparently found a cellar under a stone slab and took away the concrete foundations of his old shack in skips. Brueckner is in a German jail suspected of kidnapping three-year-old Madeleine from a holiday flat in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in May .He lived in the area then. His lawyer dismissed the searches as “pure desperation”. His friend said: “We never thought his crimes involved children – he was a kleptomaniac. We just thought he stole everything in sight. “He told me what he got up to when he lived in Portugal. He said he had been surviving by breaking into hotel rooms, stealing cameras and laptops. “But the strangest thing he ever told me was about breaking into a room where four teenagers from Britain were sleeping on the sofa and floor. “He was naked and had left his clothes outside and he was masturbating. When one woke up and tried to wake the others up he panicked and ran out. “He said he ran naked through the town. He told it like a funny story.” The pal said he didn’t know for certainthis happened in Praia da Luz – but he believes it was in the same area. He told how he befriended Brueckner at a kiosk the German owned in Braunschweig, North Germany, in .“We used to drink in a back room. He talked about his crimes and was kind of proud about it.” The friend said that Brueckner claimed he stole £, from a house where the large deposit for a property sale was being stashed. He claims Brueckner boasted of using the money to buy a house in Baia, where he lived as a child, and the kiosk. “It was all thefts, burglaries and drugs he talked about. He never mentioned children,” said the pal. “He even claimed the palm trees in his garden were stolen. There was not one day when he didn’t steal something.” The friend said the German claimed he also used some of his £, haul to buy a disused factory in East Germany at an auction.  Earlier this year police are said to have searched the grounds and found eight USB sticks in a bag, some containing child abuse images. Brueckner ended up living at the Braunschweig garden allotment between  and .Sabine Sellag, the owner of his former shack and plot, fears she may have been sleeping above the body of another missing child known as the ‘German Maddie’.Brueckner was quizzed but never charged after Inga Gehricke, five, vanished in  near where he lived.Locals said he prised open floorboards in the shack soon after arriving to gain access to an underground cellar.  He was one of around six people living on one of the  plots, which is forbidden.“A few homeless people live there but they get away with it because it helps with security,” the pal said. “He was friendly to people. I think he was lonely deep down.”But after three years he was on the move again after police started to quiz him about missing Inga and accessing web porn. “I think he went back to Portugal, I never saw him again,” said the friend. “He sold everything he had. He bought a car to leave with.” "},{"url":null,"title":"manchester revellers enjoy another big","story":"NewsManchester revellers enjoy another big night out amid lockdown rules confusionFor the second night in a row since new coronavirus restrictions were brought in, venues were packed as drinkers criticise confusing rules announced unexpectedly this weekShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  AUG NewsLarge groups gathered in Manchester for the second night in the row amid lockdown rules confusion \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But he allowed pubs, restaurants and places of worship to remain open. Mancunians have branded the governmentaposs advice “all over the place”. Despite the order coming into effect at midnight on Friday, venues were filled less than  hours later, and there were similar scenes last night. On Friday revellers hit out at the government - saying it wasnapost clear what they can and canapost do.Enjoying a drink in the trendy Northern Quarter on Friday night, Nicole Casseldon, , told the Sunday Mirror : “The Government has failed to make anything clear.It’s really busy here but we can’t meet our family or friends at home or in the garden. It doesn’t make any sense.”  Her friend Molly Mayston, also , added: “We have spent months and months at home being careful. This latest advice is all over the place.” Zoe Hindson, who travelled from Ripon, North Yorks, said government advice is confusing and upsetting. People can be fined up to £they do not stick to the rules, which will be reviewed next week. They can meet outdoors of up to six - but must social distance from people they do not live with.  Guidances issued by the government says people in Greater Manchester should not socialise with people you do not live with in other indoor public venues – such as pubs, restaurants, cafes, shops, places of worship, community centres, leisure and entertainment venues, or visitor attractions. The rules continue: You may attend these venues with people you live with , but should avoid interaction with iniduals or groups from other households.

Thomas, , has been left fuming since reading extracts of explosive new book Finding Freedom, which is said to have been tacitly approved by Meghan and Prince Harry. And he now plans to enjoy his retirement travelling the world to distract himself from the heartbreak. In an exclusive interview, Meghan’s half-brother Tom Markle Jnr, who speaks to their dad every day, said: “As far as a reunion goes, he’s given up on Meghan and Harry completely. “He doesn’t trust her and doesn’t want to know that person because of the lies, manipulation and deceit. He just had his th birthday – needless to say, he didn’t hear from Meghan.” Tom Jnr, , says his dad denies the book’s claims he ignored scores of texts and calls telling him to come to her and Harry’s  wedding. The couple have tried to distance themselves from the book, insisting they did not contribute and it was based on “independent reporting”. Speaking about the book’s claims, Tom Jnr said: “It says Harry spoke to our dad to sayhe’d listened to him, Harry, there wouldn’t have been any problems. That just did not happen.  “All these hundreds of texts and calls Meghan sent my dad ahead of the wedding  Our father wasn’t even at his house. He was in hospital. “His phone was switched off. That’s why he didn’t answer, there’s no way he could have. Our dad actually called her scores of times ahead of the wedding after he made the mistake of doing those pics, but he was ignored. “The Palace told Meghan and Harry to send help for my father so he could deal with the Press but they refused. Meghan herself said no.” Tom Jnr also claimed the infamous letter Meghan, , sent their dad – triggering a high-profile privacy case at the High Court – includes as-yet-unrevealed contents he describes as “horrying” and “very hurtful”.  The retired Hollywood lighting expert is expected to give evidence against Meghan as part of the case. But despite now giving up on his daughter, Thomas – who lives in Rosarito, Mexico – is still desperate to build a relationship with his -month-old grandson Archie.

A recent survey of , UK drivers revealed most drivers do not actually know legal fact from fiction when it comes to the Highway Code. For example, people tend to believe driving in your flip flops or barefoot is illegal, but actually it is not. Many of these habits are not illegal per se, but could lead to careless driving chargesthey cause people not to drive safely. Here are some of the most common myths: Driving in flip flopsNearly halfof people surveyed thought it was illegal to drive in flip flops, according to Manchester Evening News.As long as you wear them in a correct manner, it is not illegal to wear them. Under Rule  of the Highway Code, drivers are advised they must have footwear and clothing which does not prevent you using the controls in the correct manner. You could face a careless driving chargethey impede your ability to drive safely. Driving in high heels Similarly to driving in flip flops, driving in high heels is not illegal, as long as the driver has full control of the car. Driving barefoot Over  per cent of people thought driving barefoot was illegal. It is not illegal, as long as you can control your vehicle safely. And while it is not illegal to drive without shoes on, that does not mean it is right. According to the Driving Standards Agency – the body that regulates the UK driving test – “suitable shoes are particularly important behind the wheel. We would not recommend driving barefoot because you don’t have the same braking force with bare feet as you do with shoes on.” Putting on your caraposs interior light while driving Although  per cent of drivers thought this was illegal, the Highway Code does not say that drivers must not turn their caraposs interior light on while behind the wheel. When turned on the light must not distract the driver or shine out of the back windscreen to obstruct the view of anyone that is travelling in a vehicle behind.   However,a police officer stops you as they believe the light is causing a distraction, they have the right to tell you to turn it off.  Only  per cent of people polled correctly identied that all of these things are in fact legal in the UK. While it might be a weight off people’s minds to get these misconceptions debunked, there is also confusion where too, with drivers not being able to identy the following habits as illegal:Moving into a bus lane to let an ambulance throughPaying on your phone by Apple Pay at a drive-thru Flashing your lights to give way to someoneGoing mph in a mph zone and not getting caught on a speed cameraPulling over to check a map or your phone with the engine runningUsing the middle lane of the motorway for normal drivingBeeping your horn at someone in angerUsing the left-hand lane of the motorway for slow drivingDriving with snow on the roof of your carSleeping in your car while drunkLetting your dog out for a wee on the hard shoulder evenbroken down"},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry rocked la earthquake","story":"NewsPrince Harry rocked by LA earthquake minutes after last public appearanceThe Duke of Sussex, , joined a virtual global summit for his sustainable tourism project Travalyst on Thursday.

Omid Scobie, ABC News royal contributor and author of the new biography Finding Freedom, said that Harry would definitely have felt it. The Duke of Sussex, , delivered the opening speech at a virtual global summit for his sustainable tourism project Travalyst on Thursday.Speaking by video link from his LA home, he urged the travel industry to build back better after the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.He said: We need to build back - but we need to build back better. And that means thereaposs a responsibility, a responsibility we cannot avoid or dismiss, for us to reshape this industry in a way that benefits everyone and everything for decades to come. The Dukeaposs appearance was the first after new details about his and Meghanaposs le around the Royal Family were revealed in the new biography Finding Freedom.  Scobie claimed that the earthquake would have woken up Harry, since it took place around .am local time, the Express reports.The royal expert, who is close to both Harry and Meghan, said: He not only headed up this summit around midnight his time in LA so that as many participants could join as possible. There was also a part two at around am UK time and it was in middle of that, at around approximately .am, that an earthquake struck LA.  And it would no doubt have been felt by the Sussexes so Iaposm sure some sleep was much deserved by the Duke after that. The earthquake was felt most strongly in the epicentre of San Fernando.  No damages or deaths were reported, but about  smaller aftershocks followed the initial quake. Many celebrities felt the earthquake and shared their reactions on social media.Oh man!! wrote Khloe Kardashian. Wow that felt much bigger than a . #earthquake. So scary! Sneakers and my flashlight by my bed.Perhaps I should get out of bed and put on something cute in case I have to suddenly flee..., wrote Jenner Tilly.

Loud music was played for hours at The Royal Oak in Hooe, Plymouth, on Saturday.But landlord Lee Chambers claimed that the event under control and fully compliant with coronavirus regulations, reports PlymouthLive.One resident, who asked to remain anonymous, said: The Royal Oak have been having a live music event since the late afternoon - in the beer garden but clearly no social distancing in place. We phoned the Royal Oak to complain about the noise and they argued with my partner on the phone saying aposthey can do what they want as they have the license for itapos. When we challenged them on social distancing measures they hung up the phone.  She claimed the music was playing very loudly from pm until pm. A video shows a crowd of punters singing to aposSweet Carolineapos with one person climbing on top of a table to dance.  Lee Chambers added: We had a bit of a rock band on tonight, from  to .pm, which is well within our licensing range.  We got a phone call about .pm complaining about the noise so we turned it down and didn’t have any complaints after that. During the summer holidays we have a free barbecue, from  noon through to pm. We fully comply with the Covid rules, we have seated-only outside in the garden and full table service. The music only lasted two hours and a half hours and the customers were enjoying themselves. We have only one entrance into the beer garden and one route out and I was monitoring it from outside. We had a register where everyone who comes in has to sign and give contact number and we keep a check of how many people are in the garden.  The pub is predominantly locals – we’re a village community really and I’d say about % of our customers are from the village, regulars and locals. The very last thing we want is to upset our neighbours. As soon as we got that phone call we did turn it down. Our licence does let us play music until pm but I wouldn’t do that – which is why we stopped at .pm. Everyone has come out the lockdown and want to meet up, relax and socialise, have food, a drink, listen to some live music.

The reprimand is said to have happened after the Queenaposs dresser and adviser Angela Kelly did not meet Meghanaposs sudden demand to visit Buckingham Palace and try on a tiara that the couple had chosen for their wedding,  due to royal protocol. A new biography of Harry and Meghan accuses the Queenaposs adviser of deliberately dragging her feet when the Duchess of Sussex asked to have access to the tiara ahead of their wedding in May . According to the authors of Finding Freedom, Harry felt that some of the old guard at Buckingham Palace simply didnapost like Meghan and would stop at nothing to make her le dficult.  But a Mail on Sunday source gave a very dferent version of events. The source said: The bookaposs version of what happened would not be everyone aposs recollection of events and certainly not those who were close to it. Angela essentially said, aposIaposm very sorry, thataposs not how it works.apos Thereaposs protocol in place over these jewels. Theyaposre kept under very tight lock and key. You canapost turn up and demand to have the tiara just because your hairdresser happens to be in town. The Duke of Sussex allegedly put pressure on courtiers to persuade Ms Kelly to travel to London and unlock the cupboard where the tiara is kept. The paper goes on to claim the prince used rude language about Ms Kelly after she pointed out that an appointment must be booked in advance to access the Queenaposs jewels. The Queenaposs adviser alerted Her Majesty when she learnt of Harryaposs bad language, prompting the monarch to call him for a private meeting. A Royal source told the Mail on Sunday: He was put firmly in his place. He had been downright rude. Ms Kellyaposs official title is personal assistant, adviser, and curator , but behind closed doors, she is more importantly a trusted confidante, friend and almost like a sister to the Queen.It is said that when the Queen tells staff she is stepping out for a bit it is actually royal code for her popping to see Ms Kelly.We are two typical women, Ms Kelly told  The in a rare interview in .We discuss clothes, make-up, jewellery.

Self-indulgent solo bliss. I spent a week drinking juice and doing yoga, indulging in pure, unadulterated, guilt-free me-time... Selfish  You betcha! But I have come home a better person – a more patient mum, a nicer we, a stress-free worker, a kinder friend. After four months in lockdown, cooking, cleaning, washing and ironing, home-schooling two kids while trying to work and run a business, with my husband also working from home... I was on my knees. I came out of lockdown looking and feeling like a battered old woman. So off I went. I believe that unless I look after my own health first and am firing on all cylinders with an energised and positive frame of mind, I’m actually not in a good place to look after my family’s needs. When I take a moment to compare my mum’s le to mine, I wonder how she managed to do all that, keep sane and carry on  She had an arranged marriage, met my dad literally on her wedding day, left her home, family, friends and everything she knew to come to the UK with my dad to make a new le for herself. Once here, she had four kids under the age of five to look after and then worked. She cooked, cleaned, entertained day in and day out. And the only me-time she ever got was curling up on the sofa after all the chores were done with a cup of tea and a biscuit in front of Dallas. We all flew the nest and then my dad died in his s. She was left on her own without having a clue how to take care of her own needs. She was lonely and wasn’t used to having a purpose outside of taking care of her family. It was this experience that made me promise myself that taking time out, away from my kids and hubby, and have time to just check in with myself was important. I also want to ensure that no matter what age I am, I have the confidence to meet new people, make friends and be adventurous – because by doing that you have less chance of being lonely in later le. If there’s one thing I’ve learned from my mum, it’s not to leave it too late to put yourself first. Alone time can boost your mental health, and help you to be more empathetic, appreciative and grateful.

Michael Barlow and his men partied in Las Vegas and spent their cash - earned through drug dealing - in luxury shops.Barlow also made donations to Catholic churches and a youth club in Everton, the Liverpool Echo reports.But police had bugged his BMW and were covertly filming and listening to his men at work in a luxury flat turned drugs factory. Last week, fugitive dealer Paul Graney - roped into the multi-kilo conspiracy by his identical twin brother Joseph - was locked up. These are the secret conversations that helped detectives dismantle the gang. The cocaine and heroin plots were led by Barlow, then , who was recorded bragging in his BMW: Weaposre up to our eyebrows. Weaposre swimming in gear. Joseph Graney, then , was described as his right hand man, and a third dealer, Alan Foster, then , as the trusted subordinate of the gang. They worked at Waterside Apartments in Princes Dock, where Barlow, Joseph Graney and Foster, then later Paul Graney and a man called Liam Mills, were secretly recorded as part of Operation Harthill. Footage captured hundreds of thousands of pounds being counted and kilo-sized blocks of Class A drugs, but not a single fingerprint or item of DNA was found. The forensically highly aware gang wore latex gloves as they cut drugs with adulterants, stored cash in a microwave and operated a drugs press. Their product was shipped across the UK and the gang made so much money, their counting machine was once recorded operating for two hours straight. When officers sneaked into the flat on several occasions, they discovered tick lists mentioning major deals, sealed mobile phone boxes and SIM cards, boxes and drawers full of cash, and took samples of drugs destined for criminals in London and the North East. On June , , a man called Darren Jones was stopped at the M Toll in Staffordshire in a Renault Kangoo van. Inside was kg of heroin, valued between £, to £,, and £, in cash - contained in bags of the same make and colour seen at the gangaposs flat. On June , a bug attached to Barlowaposs BMW recorded him talking on the phone to an unidentied criminal. Barlow said he would arrange for a solicitor to represent Jones and put some money into his account, adding: Drugs were worth half a million quid.  Officers entered the flat on July  and July . They found bags of white powder containing cocaine and tetramisole, bags of brown powder containing heroin, caffeine and paracetamol, and a blue aposCompassapos holdall, similar to one found in Jonesapos van. Some bags were marked Anchlot, Dicky and Cuz. On July  officers entered again and found more phones, a note referring to a Peugeot vehicle, later stopped by police in the North East, when £, in cash was seized. On July , Barlow and Joseph Graney were at the flat, counting money and discussing associates and drugs. Later that day, officers entered and found £, in a bedside table. On July , the same pair were counting cash in the flat. Barlow commented on the large amount of money and Joseph Graney replied itaposs worth moving some though innit  before Barlow made notes in a ledger and discussed someone being owed £,.  They also talked about blue holdalls in the flat, one of them remarking all the best from TJaposs lad, them bags - thought to be a reference to the holdalls being bought at TJ Hughes. On July , Barlow and Liam Mills discussed bags, weights, the importance of wearing gloves at all times, and the need to get a PGP encrypted phone, before explaining how a ledger worked and to store any money in the microwave. On July , officers entered and found £, in one bag, more cash in the microwave, and new, unwrapped Compass holdalls, before Barlow and Foster both visited the flat. As they used a cash counting machine to count £, and talked about stock, Barlow said Charlie Brown must be doing well to which Foster replied Does mate. F***ing hell, there mustnapost be any f***ing £ notes in f***ing Newcastle.  On July , Barlow was at the flat with Joseph Graney as they counted cash for two hours straight, and mentioned that Brownie was off for four weeks, so it was their last chance to get a good rate - discussing what is believed to be the purchase of kg of cocaine. Joseph Graney said: I know lad [inaudible] Brownie, you know lad, erm [inaudible], to give to home, cos his mates are off now for four weeks, so itaposs the last week of catching him before [inaudible] his mates. Just so we get the next five again, so we can get another five again. Officers entered the flat that day and found nearly £, in cash and blue holdalls similar to that seized from Jones, then the next day recorded Barlow saying there was £, under the bed. On July , Barlow and Joseph Graham counted money, as Barlow said thereaposs two in Durham, who takes lemo. On August , Barlow was in the flat and mentioned the twin was coming to collect money, before Joseph Graney, who he referred to as Joe, arrived and they chatted about  quid for Carlo. Barlow asked: Have you put the rest of that in the till, the microwave  On August , Barlow worked in the kitchen, weighing brick sized cocaine packages on scales and putting it into bags, before Joseph Graney arrived to count cash, and chatted to a woman present about how similar he and his brother looked. Both the boss and his right hand man were there again on August  and August , when Barlow talked about a flat being raided and linked to a van. He told Joseph Graney: Weaposre in big trouble, Iaposve got about five people in jail. The pair worked at the flat on August  and , counting cash and packaging drugs, and chatted about the bizzies finding something out, someone looking for Barlow and accusing him of not being proactive enough in getting a name from up there. They worked at the flat together over the next three four days, once while a child was present, and while putting cash in bundles on August , talked about Joseph Graneyaposs dabs - fingerprints - being on a bag. Paul Graney was seen with Barlow, his brother and Mills at Manchester Airport on September , when they jetted off to Las Vegas, and didnapostuntil September . Barlow continued to work at the flat that month, weighing and packaging drugs, and on September , the Graney twins were seen together at the flat for the first time, discussing bagging up product, with Joseph saying to Paul here you are, help me out here a minute, Paul asking thataposs staying, innit  and Joseph replying yep. Because of the number of his couriers arrested by police, the small and tight-knit nature of the gang, and seemingly Barlowaposs reluctance to trust others, the boss was soon forced to adopt a more aposhands onapos role. On September , he took items from the flat and caught a train from Lime Street to London Euston, where he met a man called Pierre Reid to hand over kg of high purity cocaine. But this package was intercepted by police, and linked forensically to Barlow. One of the Graney twins - police were unable to say which - was seen at the flat weighing and bagging drugs on October  and . On October , the twins were together in the kitchen, both wearing gloves, weighing packages, bagging them up and placing them in a holdall. One could be heard counting nine ounces and saying thataposs seven, lemo , Barlow, put these into halves, who takes halves now   They talked about putting names on packages, before seemingly Joseph said: Whoaposs this one for  Put them in a bag now, put Ancelotti on them right. Due another one soon evenwe have to use someone . Itaposs business you know, swear down Paul, three jobs a month, one nicker a week, monkeys, how many half ounces you got there lad  Seven in, nine in there,  for Billy. Just say , sit down with Barlow now, bare minimum, Tuesday, out there now, Davey, Billy, th Megsy. Prosecutors said the gang was now dealing with smaller amounts of drugs, due to the setbacks, and rather than talking in kilos, now referred to onkers aka ounces. Yet the Graney brothers were still contemplating dealing in kg of Class A drugs a month, and earning £, every week in profits. The next day, one of the twins was at the flat with an unknown man, bagging up and weighing bags, and on October  one of the brothers was there cleaning the kitchen and moving items. Both twins were seen in the kitchen again on October , having donned latex gloves, and prepared white balls of powder and put them into plastic bags, before leaving with the drugs. Amid the sound of zipping bags, they discussed money, before seemingly Joseph said: Thataposs loads that lad, thataposll do two you know Paul.

Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said on Saturday that the Gamaleya Institute, a state research facility in Moscow, had completed clinical trials of the vaccine and paperwork is being prepared to register it. He said doctors and teachers would be the first to be vaccinated, and added: We plan wider vaccinations for October.  Russiaaposs first potential COVID- vaccine would secure local regulatory approval in August and be administered to health workers soon thereafter.  Yet the speed at which Russia is moving to roll it out has prompted some Western media to question whether Moscow is putting national prestige before science and safety. The head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, Kirill Dmitriev, has likened what he said was Russiaaposs success in developing a vaccine to the Soviet Unionaposs  launch of Sputnik , the worldaposs first satellite. Britain takes a similar view to the US in being sceptical of the Russian vaccine and is unlikely to be ordering it in for use here, thereports.  One source said: “We would use a vaccinewe trusted the data.” Crucially, it depended on how open the Russians or Chinese were, the source said. Russia has released no scientic data proving the vaccine’s safety or efficacy while details of the British vaccine being tested have already been published in The Lancet. Public health experts say it would be impossible for Britain to accept a vaccine from another country without all internationally recognised protocols being met.

It was often said, you don’t see Kalisa without Hubert being close by. So, while it is truly heart-wrenching that we had to say goodbye to this iconic pair, we can take comfort in knowing they left together.

A manuscript written by Virginia Giuffre says the Duke had “a really good time” and that she gave him “numerous massages”. Ms Giuffre – who was  or  at the time – says she was later rewarded with “close to a thousand dollars” by convicted paedophile Epstein. The sensational claims emerged in a tranche of newly-released court papers which Epstein’s former lover Ghislaine Maxwell, , tried to block. Describing her time with Andrew at Epstein’s ,-acre Zorro ranch near Sante Fe, New Mexico, Ms Giuffre writes: “My job was to entertain him endlessly, whether that meant having to bestow him my body during an erotic massage or simply take him horseback riding. The mansion was completely empty save a couple of maids who also cooked our dinners for us, and a couple of bodyguards that we hardly even saw at all.” She claims Maxwell – a longtime pal of Andrew,  – arranged for her to go to the ranch, around , but did not tell her who would be there. “Ghislaine only told me that I was to meet someone there, not sure of whom that was. It wasn’t my place to ask,” Ms Giuffre claims. When she arrived at the ranch she saw Andrew who, she says, greeted her with the “same old cheesy grin” she had seen when they met up previously in London and New York. Unlike the Prince’s other visits to Epstein’s homes, the American financier and Maxwell were not present. Ms Giuffre says after two days with Andrew, she was recalled to New York to debrief Epstein and Maxwell. She says that during a conversation in the tycoon’s kitchen Maxwell asked: “So… how was the ranch with the Prince ” Ms Giuffre, now  and a mum of three living in Australia, says she replied: “I think he had a really good time, he seemed relaxed and when we said goodbye he gave me a kiss. “I took him horse-riding, just around the property, we went swimming in the pool and, of course, I gave him plenty of massages. He had a massage at least couple of times each day, really seeming to enjoy his time there.” Describing the reaction of Epstein and his lover Maxwell, she adds: “Like proud parents, they looked me with such content. ‘Good, you did really well,’ Jeffrey complimented me.” She says Epstein gave her “close to a thousand dollars… more than what I thought anybody at my young age could make for a couple of days work”.  During the Prince’s interview with BBC Newsnight last November, he was at pains to suggest he was never alone while at Epstein’s properties in New York, Florida and the Caribbean. But he was not asked about visiting Zorro.A former ranch hand told the Sunday Mirror he saw Andrew a couple of times but never “without Jeffrey or Ghislaine”. The new claims heap more pressure on the politan Police to release logs kept by royal protection officers.One former royal bodyguard, Paul Page, has said notes would include times and dates of trips the Prince took. Logs are kept for  years. Forty-seven court documents were unsealed by New York Judge Loretta Preska on Thursday.They relate to a  civil case between Maxwell and Ms Giuffre. A second wave of papers could be released – subject to an appeal scheduled for next month.  It was in a  affidavit that Ms Giuffre – referred to as Jane Doe  – claimed she had sex with Andrew in Maxwell’s Belgravia home, Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse and at an orgy on the tycoon’s Caribbean island.Her claims were struck out of the civil case by Florida judge Kenneth Marra. He ruled: “The factual details regarding with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent to this central claim , especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government. These unnecessary details shall be stricken.” In other claims reported yesterday, Ms Giuffre alleges Andrew had “an orgy with numerous other under-aged girls” at Epstein’s Caribbean home – and Maxwell had “continuous” sex with girls and women. Maxwell was arrested in New Hampshire last month on suspicion of grooming and abusing three girls under the age of . She is also accused of perjury and faces up to  yearsconvicted.She has pleaded not guilty and is due for trial in New York in July . Andrew and his legal team have vehemently denied Ms Giuffre’s claims.A picture shows them together but the Prince said in his Newsnight appearance that he does not recall ever meeting her.Epstein, , killed himself in jail last year while awaiting sex-trafficking charges.Andrew was pictured walking with the tycoon in New York’s Central Park in , just months after the paedophile was released from prison for procuring a minor for prostitution.

Some of the centres claim sonar ­signals “activate brain cells”children touch heads with the mammals. Staff at one waterpark visited by the Sunday People even claimed children unable to speak had uttered their first words after contact with dolphins. Dozens of other parks offer services online – some claiming therapy can beat cancer and aid people with Down’s syndrome, cerebral palsy and post-traumatic stress disorder. The centres, which also host cruel dolphin shows, charge people up to £,, assuring parents that their child will see signicant benefits. But experts accuse them of offering  hope. Prof Richard Mills, a consultant for AT-Autism and former research ­director at the National Autistic Society, said: “It’s exploiting people to spend a lot of money on something where there is no ­evidence of any benefits.” We visited three parks in or near Antalya – Aksu Dolphinarium, Dolphinland and Dolphin Park Kemer. Aksu said British people “come more and more”.  Kemer said many come from the UK. Dolphinland told us “not so many English” people come. All three parks claimed potential benefits for autistic people. To examine the claims we took autism awareness campaigner Emma Dalmayne, , and her autistic children Damien, , and Skylar, seven. Emma, who is also autistic, was horried when she saw a ­therapy session at Dolphinland. She said: “Don’t waste your money, it’s a scam.”  Emma was told by Aksu staff that her children would only show benefits six months later – at which point she should buy another ten-day course for £, per child to maintain progress. One therapist bragged how staff would coax her kids to swim evendistressed, adding: “Evenhe cries, it’s normal for him to cry.” Emma said: “When I heard them talking about my child’s brain it was horrying. “It’s yet ­another scam to fleece naive parents who are wasting thousands that could be spent on a more beneficial pastime that would give the­ ­children tools to cope in the world.”  None of the centres we spoke to guaranteed ­improvement or a cure. But all three said there were long-term ­benefits for ­autism and ­tried to sell Emma ten sessions. Aksu staff said: “It cannot heal but it can make it better. It’s not a cure, it’s just a ­treatment but you can make it better and dolphin therapy makes it better.” A rep showed images of children touching heads with the mammals to exchange “waves”. He said: “Electromagnetic waves help activate the brain of children. In some cases they can lose symptoms.” A therapist at Dolphinland told us the animals have “signals and ­vibrations” and “they send these signals everywhere”. She claimed: “For the kids with autism it helps so much. We have the kids that come every year and they’re better every year. “If they don’t speak, for example, they start talking after therapy. Yes!”  Emma says Damien and Skylar have sensory issues which can lead to ­“flapping, gritting of teeth, spinning and repeating things to calm down”. When she askedthese symptoms could be helped by dolphins, the ­therapist at Dolphinland said: “Yes of course” – adding that the children could lose “some of the bad energy”. Asked outrightit would “heal” a lot of her children’s behaviours, Emma was told: “We hope so. Not all the kids are better. But you may try.”  We saw a session at Dolphinland, where the creatures are also made to perform tricks like throwing balls and catching hoops in shows. Twin girls aged four spent  minutes with two “therapists” and two dolphins in their  x  metre pool. One child screamed and cried as the dolphins rolled over so the girls could stroke them. Their mother, from Craiova, Romania, said they were on day seven of ten and admitted her twins were “afraid” of the animals. She said: “We need to wait six months but we are coming in August again.” Watching the therapy session left Emma distressed. The mum of six, from Plumstead, South London, said: “It was heartbreaking to see ­animals in pools with ­children screaming and crying. It’s cruelty mixed with fake ­therapy. My children’s reactions were horror, anger and sadness for the children we saw. “I had to leave and cry. My son asked, why are they doing this  He’s very upset.”  When askedDolphin Park Kemer practitioners were medically trained and ­experienced with autism, the rep there said: “He’s experienced in making therapy, in how to stand in the water and play with the dolphin. “It’s for the nervous system. Therapists stay in the water with the child... when you put your head underwater you can hear the signal. Honestly you don’t need a doctor. I can say this. This is something ­alternative for the child.” When Emma askedtherapy could stop her ­children “flapping and making noises” he replied “yes”, before adding: “I ­cannot guarantee you will see these effects, nobody can say this.” Asked againit is a “good treatment for ­autism”, he insisted: “Yes, yes, yes.”  Prof Mills said: “Dolphin therapy promotes a narrative that autism can be cured. We know it canapost. We suspect any benefit from swimming with them is social. To take it to a pseudo-scientic level about brainwaves is too far.” We visited all three parks in March. They closed because of Covid but have ­reopened and are offering therapy.

Aberdeen, too, have their AberDNA setup and we wondered why Dundee didn’t have a similar thing.“It was a no-brainer when you think about it.“I put the proposal together initially going through DFCSS but then I took it to the club and they really liked the idea.”The levels of monthly subscription y from £, £, £ and £ with all money going directly to the club.In , members get rewards including pin badges, scarves, t-shirts, signed Dundee tops and hospitality.Ross, though, is keen for the idea to evolve as the Foundation grows and is looking for input from more fans.“I think the idea will change and grow over time,” he says.“In the current situation, it was a case of getting it out right away rather than having the perfect product because we all know the appetite is there to help the club.“The feedback so far has been very positive and that’s not always the case with these things! A lot of people are saying it’s exactly what the club has needed for a while.“It’s a way to keep money coming into the club and it might go on to pay for two players a yearit all develops and builds.”He added: “There are lots of dferent fan groups and factions and I wanted to launch the Foundation with the Supporters’ Society, the DSA, the Historical Trust and everybody involved.“We want to get fans on board and involved. Things are tough right now and I think back to the Deefiant season with the togetherness in the stands. We could do with more of that.”Ross has been helped out by fellow supporter Scott Roberts, with both taking on the role of foundation ambassadors as well as by staff at Dens Park.Previously he was pivotal in setting up DeeTV and is happy to be working with the club again with the hope the foundation can bring the club and fans closer.Ross said: “I think being associated with the club gives it that legitimacy for fans and has helped a lot.“Tommy Young and Jonny McInally at the club have been very helpful in giving advice on the infrastructure and how it will all work.“It’s dficult with the current situation but we’re talking about doing a proper launch for it because we are concerned it has only been on social media really so far and that only reaches a certain audience. Unfortunately, we can’t be going to games at Dens to convince people to join.“Overall, I think I’d like to see better communication between the club and fans. I think this is a way we could achieve that. It’s something that’s been missing for some time. There will also be a steady income stream for club as well but, hopefully, we can improve the communication because, to me, that is the key to success.“It’s important that people get value for money and that it’s worth signing up for. At the moment it’s very much – you get to this level of donation, you get this reward. I know a lot of people might not be interested in getting a pin badge or whatever but the plan is for the Foundation to change over time.”Happy MonDees member Scott deserves huge credit for his own fundraising efforts for the club after setting up a GoFundMe in order to ‘Support the Dee’ and have next season’s shirt adorned with a ‘Thank You to the NHS’ badge on the sleeve.To date, this has raised £, for the club with a percentage being donated to Roxburghe House.He said: “I had been looking online at all the efforts done by fans of other clubs like Raith Rovers, Dunfermline, Partick Thistle and Hearts was a big one. It was all great work done and it didn’t appear like much was happening to put money into Dundee at the time.“I didn’t know much about GoFundMe and one of my mates suggested I just start it up.“It was around the time when we were all clapping on Thursday nights for the NHS workers and I thought of all the fantastic efforts those workers do. My father has had a bit of ill health and I’ve had a couple of knee operations myself so I always see the work done by doctors and nurses as fantastic.“It was a way to give them a wee thank you but also to help Dundee and to donate money to Roxburgh House, which most people in Dundee have had relatives go to unfortunately.“The football club will decide how much ends up going there because we didn’t know how much we would raise at the start. There wasn’t a target, I hoped we’d get to about £,.“But I spoke to guys at the club and they said no matter the amount raised, the thank you message would be going on the shirts.“We got past £, quickly and I we’re over £, now.”He added: “There’s also been other stuff off the back of it too which has been great. Scott McRuvie from the Whitehall Theatre and a bunch of fans are running  mileswhich is fantastic and there’s been the shirt sale the club did and the raffle which have all raised money.“I’m really surprised with how much was raised but I know Dundee fans love the club. People have been great, I seen some guys put in £, others £ which is amazing for anybody to give.

I think it would be a good idea or the council to consider installing CCTV at all city cemeteries.#Lesley Nicoll whose son, Lee, is buried in Birkhill, has reported vandalism and theft of the grave on previous occasions.All three women have joined forces to try and force the council to act.Karen said: #My son Dale#s grave has been targeted before. Dale was killed in a motorbike accident in  and on three occasions a small motorbike memorial I had at his grave stone has been stolen.#It is not acceptable that people should have to keep finding damage and vandalism at the graves of their loved ones.#I have asked the council on numerous occasions in the past why they can#t install CCTV cameras to try to stop this and to catch whoever is causing the damage.#So far I have not had a satisfactory response.#Councillor Anne Rendall, Dundee City Council#s neighbourhood services convener, said: #When the petition is submitted, we will look into the issues that have been raised and respond to the petition in due course.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I would put them in because I feel they will give United a better chance of winning a match.”Meanwhile, Mellon has expressed his delight at the prospect of fans being allowed into games.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced that Scottish football can pencil in September  as the day when the game can tentatively begin to welcome back supporters.That would mean the Tangerines’ home fixture against St Mirren five days later being the first chance the faithful will get to see their players in the flesh since the coronavirus lockdown started in March.Mellon said: “It is terric. We all know what football means to fans and that is what it is all about, particularly here at Dundee United.“To get the fans back in to celebrate their team being back in the Premiership again is huge.“It is a terric step forward. We all love football with the fans and the atmosphere. It should be terric.”Indeed, Mellon revealed that United’s big fan base was one of the reasons he decided to take over form Robbie Neilson.He added: “There were many factors that attracted me here but the fan base is also terric.“Fans are the leblood of the club and it is important to see we are making progress against a terrible virus is pleasing as well.“We must feel it is safe to do that and it is a great boost to everyone.”BIG KICK OFF: Five Dundee United players to watch in the Premiership this season\" title\"#BIG KICK OFF: Five Dundee United players to watch in the Premiership this season# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp kick-off-five-dundee-united-players-premiership embed # secretNSjmgAX\" data-secret\"NSjmgAX\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Bringing back business safely remains a key priority.#Face coverings are mandatory for both passengers and crew throughout the flight, and new aircraft cleaning procedures have been introduced including disinfecting all surfaces in contact with customers.In addition, the air in the cabin is renewed every three minutes.KLM said it was a #positive sign of recovery# that more routes were beginning to operate after many were grounded to a halt in the past few months due to the coronavirus pandemic.Benedicte Duval, general manager for Air France KLM in the UK and Ireland, said: #Our decision to increase the frequency on our Aberdeen to Amsterdam service to four flights per day by the end of August is a positive sign of recovery, after what has been and still is a challenging time for our industry.#KLM continued to operate a skeleton service to and from Aberdeen throughout the corona crisis, assisting the local community with essential travel and repatriation. As travel restrictions in Scotland begin to ease, we are increasing capacity in line with consumer demand.#Meanwhile at home, both First Bus and Stagecoach have confirmed that service frequencies will be increased.First Aberdeen has said it has put a number of measures in place to ensure customer and staff safety is maintained, with timetables able tocloser to normal levels from tomorrow.Changes will affect most services, with revised departure times.There will be some increases on weekend services, as well as the frequency in evenings.The firm carries out an enhanced cleaning regime including the use of anti-viral sanitiser.Vehicles have also been updated with new layouts and signs to inform customers of the additional seats available on board.First Aberdeen is encouraging people toto public transport, and is focusing on improving services where demand has ed.David Phillips, operations director at First Aberdeen, said: #We are looking forward to welcoming back even more customers over the coming weeks and months as the vast majority of services now begin to operate nearer to pre-Covid timetable levels.#This means that with social distancing still in place, we will have many more seats available than in recent weeks and services operating at higher frequencies.#We know that this additional capacity and frequency will be a great relief to some commuters, as well as customers considering their first journeys for leisure purposes.#We are delighted to play our part in helping to get the local economy moving again.#For full details on the new timetables, visit bit.ly XdNNvUMeanwhile Stagecoach will also be running more services from Monday.It has said it will be increasing its offering across Aberdeenshire and Moray ahead of the school bus services resuming, but also to help connect people with workplaces and high streets.Increases will take place on services such as  X from Aberdeen to Stonehaven via Portlethen,  from Aberdeen to Inverness via Elgin,  from Aberdeen to Elgin via Banff,  from Aberdeen to Braemar via Banchory and the Buchan area network.Stagecoach said the increase in services will help to maintain social distancing. It also has a #busy bus# indicator on its mobile app to give people the option to choose quieter services.Peter Knight, managing director at Stagecoach Bluebird, said: “Our next timetable revision is a signicant one as we are preparing to welcome school bus services back to our daily operations.#We have seen a slight increase in the number of people using our services as lockdown has eased.#The team at our eight depots across Aberdeenshire and Moray have done a fantastic job of keeping the communities connected throughout lockdown and I know they are all looking forward to getting the buses back out on the road and giving a friendly welcome back on board.”Additional cleaning is taking place, including at least daily cleaning of all buses with a particular focus on key touch points, a protective screen between the driver and passengers and physical distancing measures in place for seating.Face coverings are mandatory across all public transport services.For more information on Stagecoach#s new timetables, visit http:stge.co LtuAMPRFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July .

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy. Teaching children the beauty of the outdoors and how to care for it can bring a lelong love for natureyou love something you usually wish to protect it.And learning never stops for any of us. Sometimes it is the basics that are needed before we move on to the complexities of natural navigation or learning our stars.So for this month here is one tip : learn how to go to the toilet in the outdoors!Doing this responsibly and teaching your children makes for a lelong enjoyment of walking and exploring without the bane of wondering where the next toilet is. I know many people who find it incredibly dficult, not great when in the middle of nowhere miles from home.In a nutshell the key is to carry out all paper and sanitary waste in a sealable bag, to go aMountaineering Scotland has excellent online guidance on how to dispose of your natural waste.I hope, like me, you will wish to continue to enjoy nature and take the time to care for and immerse your senses in this beautul world we live in."},{"url":null,"title":"golf clubs set to benefit from covid support fund","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf clubs that have been affected financially by the coronavirus pandemic are being offered support via a funding package funded by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews.In total the funding is worth £, and clubs affiliated to Scottish Golf can apply for grants being made available via two separate allocations the Covid- Fixed Costs Grant and the Club Relief Fund.Fixed Costs Grant will enable every affiliated club in Scotland to apply for aThese can include but are not exhaustive of sanitation products, Covid-related health and safety equipment, professional fees, signs, training, video conferencing licenceand any other Covid-related spend.The Club Relief Fund has been created to provide financial support to clubs who have been impacted by the pandemic and is concentrated on enabling clubs to reinstate or to increase expenditure in key areas to either improve member experience or boost income generation potential.Clubs applying to this fund are required to complete a four-stage application to ensure the review committee have the correct information available to allocate funds.The information required includes:• Standard Club Criteria and AgreementA Scottish Golf spokesperson said: #While the provision of this funding is most welcome, we do anticipate the volume of applications to be high and the criteria outlined will be strictly applied to ensure that the funds available are distributed where most needed.#We continue to explore other funding options for clubs to access and will communicate any additional opportunities should these arise.#The application process for both grants is open now until Friday July .

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"surge for ferry tickets expected today","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCalMac has today opened up bookings into October but has warned customers its telephone and websites will be #very busy#.Following discussions with Transport Scotland, the ferry company opened bookings at am for the period up to and including October .It said customer reservations made before bookings closed earlier this year are already in the system.But with the implementation of the latest physical distancing guidelines, capacity on ferries will still be less than it would be in normal circumstances, the company said.The company said: #Access to our website will be managed by a queue system, which is in place during periods of high demand to provide an improved booking experience.#When in the queue, customers will automatically be directed to our website when it#s their turn.

There are a lot of young people for whom the real world is more amazing than anything you could make up.\"Again, thats another thing were born with that gets beaten out of us, and we start using the word ordinary ndash and theres nothing ordinary.\"Were surrounded by magic. You think Harry Potters magic  Just look around you.\"That curiosity is our biggest asset because thats how we learn to adapt, thats how we learn to survive, thats how we learn to cope with the world around us as it changes.\"Lloyd, who previously worked as a Sunday Timesjournalist, was inspired to begin a career as a childrens author after seeing the joy his children experienced when they learnt new things during their years in home-schooling.Particularly that of one of his daughters who was astonished to learn all about Antarctica ndash home of her then favourite animal, the penguin.\"I believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd said.\"Then things start to get in the way, like puberty and your friendship groups change and going from primary to secondary school.\"But at the age of nine or  youve got that purity of curiosity where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy,

Credit: Jevelin Getty ImagesAnything that rubs against your face for hours on end is bound to cause some irritationmdashand face masks are no dferent. lsquoWhen it comes to cloth or surgical masks, we are primarily seeing mild skin irritation, mild comedones , and reactions to the fabric itselfrsquo, Allie McAllister, BSN, FNP-C, DCNP, explains. lsquoWhile just wearing a mask can cause friction which can be irritating to the skin, the types of materials, dyes, and detergents in the mask can also cause irritation and rashesrsquo.Besides rashes and chafing, face masks can also lead to breakouts. It makes sense when you think about itmdashyour mask is creating a moist, warm environment against your skin, which is perfect for bacteria to thrive. lsquoBreakouts can occur from sweat, dirt, and moisture being trapped under the maskrsquo, McAllister says.How to protect your skin from your face maskAlways start with a clean face. Credit: Getty ImagesFor starters, McAllister says you should always thoroughly wash your face before you put on your mask and after you take it off Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser in particular because its gentle and non-irritating. Then, McAllister recommends, lsquoIf you know yoursquoll be wearing your mask for a long period of time I would suggest applying a thin layer of Aquaphor Healing Ointment to the areas that will come in direct contact with the mask.rsquoYou can also try an anti-chafing balm, like Body Glide which is is a favourite of Reviewed staffers who run. Apply it on areas where your mask typically rubs against your skin, like the nose, cheeks, chin, or ears.Keep in mind, too you should wash your face mask regularly in the laundrymdashand McAllister agrees. She suggests using a detergent specically for sensitive skin thats free of any dyes or perfumes.Bonus: If you have the luxury of picking and choosing your mask , McAllister says the type of fabric can make a big dference in your masks comfort. She recommends a soft cotton fabric thats more breathable than other alternatives.McAllister says once again to start with Aquaphoryou notice any irritation or discomfort. However, she advises that you speak to a dermatologistthe irritation is more severe or does not resolve with Aquaphor.And as for breakouts, our lestyle writer and beauty guru Jessica Kasparian has a few products she swears by. lsquoIf a blemish pops up, I love the Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, which uses isopropyl alcohol to dry up pimples and calamine lotion to soothersquo, she says, adding, lsquoI also love hydrocolloid patches like the CosRX Acne Pimple Master Patch set.

raising funds but our key interaction with our local community.ldquoIn these dficult times, we have to look past that and make sure that the safety of our community, our fundraisers and our crew must come first, so there really was no way we could run the fete in our traditional way that kept everyone absolutely safe.ldquoIt really is great, however, to be able to run the fete lsquovirtuallyrsquo, allowing our team to engage and interact with our community and maintain the tradition of leboat day, with a Leboat Queen, and ensure that the tradition of the station and community coming together can in some way be maintained.ldquoThat has been so important to all our crew and our fundraisers and I think so important to the ongoing history of our station.ldquoThere are loads of great, safe and

have been provided with good-quality pre-prepared meals.George Robertson, who has been heavily involved with the resilience response in Dunbar, offered his praise to those involved in the scheme.He said: ldquoThe two organisers, Katy Pollock and Helen Harper, have done a terric job, and were able to recruit the services of three professional chefs from Thomas Franks Ltd, a catering company which normally provides a meals service for schools including Loretto and Belhaven Hill.ldquoMeals were prepared in the kitchens at Loretto School and then taken to the Bleachingfield Centre in Dunbar, where a team of local volunteers arranged distribution.ldquoThe service was very well received and recipients were grateful not just for the nourishing meals but also for the social contact with the

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown.

The Government is just saying, We hope that employers co-operate. I hope I win the lottery on Saturday but that doesnt mean it is going to happen.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, was a hasty addition to the line-up. On a typical Sunday, Ridge has to make do with grabbing pavement interviews with Ministers when they are on their way to The Andrew Marr Show. This time, Mr Raab was live in the studio, at the requisite two metre social distance.No worker following quarantine guidance should be penalised by employers, he said, including by being put onto sick pay.\"If someone is following the law in relation to quarantine and self-isolating the way they should, they cant have penalties taken against them.\"As for his ministerial colleague Mr Shapps being caught on the hop, the Foreign Secretary said it showed the risks for everyone.Mr Raab could not guarantee other countries would follow Spain and be taken off the ldquosafe list.\"All we can say is weve got this Joint Biosecurity Centre, we monitor the risk in real time, we take decisive swt action and so there is an element of uncertainty this summerpeople go abroad.

You can read what he had to say in full where in the paper, but in summary: Boris Johnson was uselessScottish Labour had been uselessand current Labour leader Keir Starmer was proving usefulIt was fairly predictable stuff for the former Prime Minister, except for the end when Ridge asked why he could not seem to wrench himself away from politics.

Pride in her work was evident in every sorted pile and I took my own calming pleasure from watching her, almost mesmerised by the lucidity of her movements.The nicotine cases shersquod so cleverly smuggled in were found and tipped into small plastic bags for home disposal fresh ones removed from packs to take up the smallest space sweet papers, old tissues, half empty cream tubes removed and pegs put on them to squeeze their last remnants. Empty medicine packets Irsquod left to one side on removing the contents, were crushed into cubes and disposed plastic bags pleated over and over again for re-use.In the end, as perfect as a conciergersquos display, my two bags lay ready for collection. An empty large paper carrier bag awaited my toiletries and night clothes. All I had to add was the triple adapter and clutch tight to my computer and phone.A box had been provided for the phone to fit it snugly, nestled in strong tissues. I just had to pray that the battery which drains within minutes would kick-start.For her remaining time, she discussed the puny size of this yearrsquos crops of sunflowers stunted by lack of water the suffocating  degree heat wersquore seeing in the shade skimmed lightly over the future arrival of my son Piercethe borders were closed.She talked of the hours making her conserves and her  pots of ratatouille and reconfirmed her vow not to travel beyond kms until the virus had been totally eliminated world-wide.Her actions and words poured over me ndash soothing, comforting, timeless and took me for a while far from my troubles and fears.I doubt that was deliberate on her part.

Some have been with us for centuries, with deep roots in our past and present. ldquoThey will matter for future generations, the SFC said before adding: ldquoThat said, we will be considering the overarching framework that can further develop a connected, collaborative ecosystem for learning and teaching and research reflects government and tertiary education objectives and secures accountability for public funding.:Scottish universities at risk of being wiped out by Covid- crisis , experts warnThis language worries some university insiders. Some academics fear a creeping ldquofederalisation of their institutions, the idea that there might be a de-facto overarching decision-making umbrella above inidual universities. Or, at the very least, that universities would have to accept some co-ordination on what they teach.Universities in Scotland already face effective rationing on student numbers on certain courses, because of both funding and practical considerations. Medical schools, for example, cannot teach more doctors or nurses than the NHS can offer placements too.However, there is nervousness inside universities about how they balance teaching to meet the SFCrsquos ldquogovernment objectives and to cater to what students actually want to learn.David Lott, deputy director of Universities Scotland, struck a diplomatic note. ldquoClearly Government is a major funder and there has always been a strategic dialogue between institutions and funders on the subject mix needed to meet the needs of industries and public services, ldquohe said. ldquoThat will continue to be an important part of how universities decide on their offering to learners across the world. Ultimately it comes down to learner choice what and where they want to study. It is important that higher education starts with their ambitions and meeting them with a high quality offer.There have been worries that government ministers or officials will see mergers as the solution to post-Covid austerity. The SNP has already overseen old local colleges brought together in to regional giants. Mr Lott said: ldquoMergers donrsquot save money. Thatrsquos been proven time and time again across a range of sectors. If therersquos a solid academic rationale and business case for a merger, the institutions themselves will be exploring it. Universities have always pursued strategic change and there are a lot of options universities can take to adapt provision and reconfigure how they work that are likely to be far more effective and efficient than mergers. The focus now should be on stabilisation and then adaptation and strategic change rather than focusing the number or institutions. Those conversations are happening now with the Funding Council as part of its Covid-inspired review of provision.In England, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has signalled that universities - infor support - must refocus more on STEM subjects and preparing a new generation of health workers and teachers in a new lsquorestructuring regimersquo.Scotland - to sighs of relief inside universities - is not going down that route. Ministers told stakeholders so last week.The root of Scotlandrsquos university funding crisis is that the government does not cover the full cost of tuition. So institutions raise money from commercial businesses and the fees of foreign students to plug the gap. And it looks like many foreign students may not enrol this year. Indeed, there is uncertainty over domestic numbers too.:Coronavirus: Scottish universities could have to curtail research ambitions amid funding reviewMr Lott said: ldquoWhen it comes to admissions and the intake for this next year, universities are in totally unchartered waters. ldquoUsually by this time in the cycle, when universities have received the Higher results and have matched pupilsrsquo grades to the offers made, universities would have a very solid sense of the Scottish intake numbers. Even after results day, those acceptances canrsquot necessarily be relied on this year. And the picture for international students is even less certain. Having said that, universities are getting very positive feedback from students who are eager to get on with their lives and start university in the autumn.He added: ldquoldquoThe pandemic has tested universities and university finances on a scale never seen before. Earlier in the year we described it as an existential crisis. A lot of mitigating steps have been taken since then however, universities are still walking into the new academic year with some major unknowns and itrsquos this year where the biggest financial hit was always going to come for universities so therersquos still an awful lot at stake.ldquoItrsquos impossible to compare the impact of the coronavirus pandemic to anything that has come before but it is important to remember that this crisis coincides with the major upheaval and uncertainty of Brexit and, comes after a number of years of cuts by the Scottish Government to the funding of teaching and research. Universitiesrsquo financial resilience to cope with a crisis like this was already severely depleted.Universities Scotland wants the Scottish Government to cover the full cost of tuition. Mr Lott said: ldquoWhat has become crystal clear to everyone as a consequence of the pandemic, is the extent to which international students fees subsidise the cost of Scottish studentsrsquo education.The UCU, which represents university staff, welcomed Scotlandrsquos decision not to follow England. Mary Senior, the unionrsquos top Scottish official, said this was a ldquohuge reliefrsquo, saying the ewe had an ldquoincredibly narrow vision for the future of higher education. She added: ldquoWe are clear that to truly power economic and social recovery in Scotland we need to support the ersity, breadth and depth of our university sector. ldquoThis means valuing and resourcing the widening access work to bring new learners - young and old - to gain new skills and higher learning opportunities. It goes without saying that the vocational skills universities provide in science, technology, engineering - and medical science in particular - are crucial to get us through this pandemic. However we also need to invest in teaching, and supporting arts, humanities and social science disciplines which help us to understand the world in which we live.ldquoWe do need the two governments to be working together to properly resource universities, so they are powering the education-led recovery, and not adding to the growing numbers of unemployed.There remain concerns that ldquooverarching strategic view from the Scottish Government might see universities slash certain kinds of courses, including foreign languages, especiallythey are offered by a neighbouring institution.Dundee University has already dumped German and several other institutions are understood to be considering scaling back languages in what linguists have said amounts to an lsquointellectual Brexit.The Scottish Government confirmed that it was opting out of the Williamsonrsquos ldquorestructuring regime - though it said it would continue to work with the UK authorities - which play a key role in research funding.A spokeswoman added: ldquoWe eagerly await the outcome of the Scottish Funding Councilrsquos review as the outputs of this will help inform our planning for the higher education sector and all tertiary education in Scotland.

That is because Scottish universities, especially some of the countryrsquos most prestigious institutions, have become increasingly dependent on the fees paid by foreign students - nearly a third of them Chinese.And this once booming business means universities are particularly exposed to the Covid crisis.The government, despite the SNPrsquos flagship policy of free tuition, only picks up something like p in every pound it costs to teach Scottish, or, more technically, ldquoScottish-domiciled, students.To balance their books, institutions have sometimes lucrative sidelines, such as providing accommodation or campus coffees at a profit or using their facilities to host conferences. During the lockdown that income has evaporated, stripping poundm out of the sector.Universities also have students from the rest of the UK who pay their own fees - but these do little more than cover costs. It is foreign students - who pay more than British ones - who are keeping the big prestigious institutions able to attract them in surplus. Until Covid, that is.There are fears that half of those foreigners will not materialise this coming academic year. And not just because they do not want to come.Even as lockdowns ease, prospective students are expected to struggle to get visas as bureaucracy catches up with a coronavirus backlog.With flights cancelled all around the world, there are also simple logistical problems for students to get to Scotland.In England and Wales some universities have said they will charter whole planes to bus in their customers. Scottish institutions are understood to have considered this but ruled it out as too complicated.Universities, of course, do not just teach. They have a huge role in research too - and get funding from a iety of sources to carry this out. Does such funding really cover all the costs of research  Not necessarily.So Scotlandrsquos seats of higher learning are effectively operating an underlying structural deficit. Most of the prestigious ancient universities have been able to plug this gap with money from foreign students. Some of the more modern institutions, which tend to focus on local students and vocational courses, have not.Despite the current crisis, none of this is news inside the sector. Late last year Scotlandrsquos public finance watchdog Audit Scotland said that the aggregated financial position of the  universities was good but that surpluses were concentrated at three ancient universities, Glasgow, Edinburgh and St Andrews, with high numbers of foreign or English students.Its snapshot, based on -, measured total income in the sector at pound.bn. That number - thanks to fee-paying foreign students at Glasgow, Edinburgh and St Andrews - was up.But success at the ldquorich three concealed problems where. Only pound.bn came from the Scottish Government to support students, including pound.bn from the Scottish Funding Council. This SFC budget had fallen seven per cent in real terms since -, the watchdog said.The result: more than half of Scottish universities were in deficit in -. Six of them were in deficit every year for four years. Modern universities are far more dependent in the SFC and struggling.The Covid crisis has turned this reality on its head. Because it is now the ancients exposed to foreign students which are in the most trouble.That is because foreign students at last count contributed account for poundm in fees, just under a third of this from mainland China. That is before universities sell them accommodation and other services. However, breakdowns of Chinese students alone show how dferent the picture is across the Scottish sector.Edinburgh has , Chinese students. Across the capital Queen Margaret has just five. Glasgow has ,, Glasgow Caledonian has .This Chinese market comes with a series of risks, including geo-political ones.There are real concerns in Scotland that a dramatic worsening of relations between the UK and China, including the removal of telecoms giant Huawei from G infrastructure for national security and concerns about oppression of Uigher minority and the crackdown in Hong Kong, will affect the influx of students.This summer Hong Kong students in Scotland - a signicant group in themselves - said they felt the chilling presence of China on campus.This was because of organised Chinese student groups and the presence of vetted mainland cadres working at controversial Confucius Institutes, language-learning centres funded by the Communist regime at five universities.As recently as - there were just  Chinese students at Scottish universities. The figure in - was ,, paying poundm in fees. That is twice as much as the next biggest category, students rom the United States.Last week Glasgowrsquos principal, Anton Muscatelli, warned that Britainrsquos lsquosoft powerrsquo would be erodeduniversities were to be forced to turn away Chinese students. The rise in numbers from the authoritarian mainland is now down to universities choosing Chinese. It is partly because of UK Government immigration policies that make it easier for Chinese than, say, Indians or Nigerians, to get visas.The big boom in international students is in people looking for post-graduate degrees.In - Scotland had , students, just over , undergraduates. Of these, , were Scottish, , from somewhere  in the UK, , from the EU and just under , from the rest of the world.But on post-graduate courses Scots are in a minority. Just under , of the more than , post-grads in Scotland are Scottish. Nearly , are English, Welsh or Northern Irish, almost , from the EU and fully , are from the rest of the world.The strange economics behind this boom has not gone uncriticised. Early in the lockdown Stirling academic Peter Matthews expressed ldquoanger at the Scottish Government for forcing universities to go to an international market to keep their heads above the water.ldquoScottish universities have been forced to make a choice: stick to a flat-cash income from the Scottish Funding Council and watch your university slowly wither away as it loses staff through voluntary severance and natural wastage, and buildings and equipment fall into disrepair or make riskier investment decisions in the hope than theon these is high and allows you to expand, Matthews blogged. ldquoSo wersquore left with universities that have aggressively expanded into international higher education markets to pay for new staff, shiny new buildings and equipment, fantastic library resources and who are now horribly exposed as income from international students falls off a clf.ldquoStudents from Scotland will suffer because of this, as universities are forced to make staff redundant so class sizes increase and as very basic services like libraries and IT are curtailed to make budget savings.Covid is the short-term risk. But it has, critics exposed long-term vulnerabilities. There is no guarantee foreigners will keep coming.Competition for international students is not easy. Universities, who say the have a collective backlog of poundm in capital repairs, have to look their best. Some have embarked on ambitious building projects.They also have to look good in global rankings, which requires sound underlying financial health.Scottish universities bob up and down global league tables. The latest QS world rankings have three Scottish institutions in the top , with Edinburgh in th spot and Glasgow and St Andrews lower down the field.But institutions in English-speaking world - England, United States Canada and Australia - often outrank Scottish ones. And Chinese and other Asian institutions are rising fast with Beijingrsquos Peking University, or Beida, for example, now ahead of Edinburgh.Scotlandrsquos hybrid universities - with their austere managed state-funded market for local students and free-wheeling battle for global students - have more problems than Covid."},{"url":null,"title":"ally-mclaws-finally-found-peace-solace-walking-among-gravestones","story":"Wersquore not ready to use public transport or to wander among the supermarket food shoppers ndash wersquove got used to alternative arrangements and still feel that exposure is a step too far.Many of us went into isolation before the official lockdown so wersquore only a couple of weeks away from five months in this strangely odd le of limbo.Recently my we and me were delighted to welcome our boxer dog Mishka back home ndash shersquod been staying with family in Glasgow while we were unable to take her out for walks. Since then, wersquove tried a few local parks and beaches to find suitably quiet places to walk and feel safe but the obvious places are always very busy.Maintaining two metres of separation doesnrsquot come close to what we require to feel safe. Faced with this dilemma, we decided to visit the ldquoold section of Kilmarnock cemetery.As a younger woman, my we often walked in Eastwood cemetery in Glasgow where she would enjoy the peace and quiet, and stop to read the engraved headstones.Itrsquos never been something Irsquove even considered ndash in fact, it all seemed a bit odd to want to walk in a graveyard.But Irsquove listened to her stories of those walks and the memories shersquos discovered during those quiet moments.There was a gravestone marking the resting place of a very young boy. The words on the stone said ldquoFrankiersquos norsquo a bad boy.When passing the graveside shersquod notice someone had left what appeared to be a few coins of pocket money for the wee lad. There is something very beautul about that story. Perhaps it was a mum or a grandad who left those pennies. Knowing who is not important.So, it was with stories such as this in my mind that we headed to the nearby Kilmarnock cemetery where gravestones date back more than  years.Many are grand monuments to pillars of society but there are also many more modest stones reflecting lives well lived and loved.Itrsquos here that we have found a peace, a solace and a place we like to walk together. Itrsquos not that wersquore thinking about death itself or that my cancer undoubtedly makes death more likely in the near future.Itrsquos all part of the mystery that causes so many roads to lead to the same place.

Today sees the  inter-breed champion judged against the supreme cattle champ from the year before, with the former exhibited by Balfour Baillie and the latter exhibited by his father, James Baillie.The  County Show beef champion was a -month-old Limousin cross heer, shown by Balfour Baillie from Sebay View, Tankerness. The unnamed heer’s sire was Craigatoke Jamieson and she was out of a homebred British Blue cross Limousin cow. She went on to be shown and sold at the Thainstone spectacular, on August , following the show.This will be tough decision as both animals were held in high regard by the judges at the time of their show victories. The judge from last year’s show, Albert Taylor from Northmuir, Kirriemuir said of Balfour Baillie#s heer: “She had a great carcass and bags of style. She had a real femininity about her as well.”The  supreme cattle champion was a December -born Limousin cross stot calf, shown by J. S. Baillie  Co, of Sebay Farm, Tankerness. The homebred animal was from a Limousin cross cow, sired by Newhouse Colorado. The stot itself was sired itself by Craigatoke Jameson.The unnamed stot went on to be shown at the  Thainstone spectacular that year, held on August .John Wight, from Bigger, was the interbreed cattle judge at the  County Show, of his winner he said: “He’s the best calf I’ve seen for some time. He was extraordinary – how he stood, his back end, top line, a lovely head and excellent on his legs. He was an outright champion.”SHEEP Our match-up in the sheep is between two Texels – the  County Show overall sheep champion and the champion from five years before, in .

The interbreed sheep judge that year was Jim Kennedy, of Lyonston Farm, Mayboyle, who said Mr Scott’s gimmer showed “a bit of power and strength” which he looks for in any breed.The judge said: “She had a very good head on her and very good skin. She was a beast that would have stood in any company at any show.”The  sheep champion was a Texel ewe lamb shown by Ivan Scott,  Hill of Heddle, Finstown. Born in March, the ewe lamb was by Cairness United and out of a Knap ewe by Knock Papoose. It was a very successful show for Mr Scott who hadn’t shown anything for the  years previous to the  show.Mr Kenny Mair, from Kinnermit Farm, in Turrf judged the ewe. He said of the champion: “The Texel is a very bright and alert animal who stood well. She had a fair bit of character.”Check back at .pm to see what our judges went for.

expanded shielding programme was ldquojust speculation.His comments come after reports surfaced that Boris Johnson had ordered officials to work up a plan for avoiding a second national lockdown.The Times reported the Prime Minister held a ldquowar game session with Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Wednesday to run through possible options for averting another nationwide lockdown that could stall any potential economic recovery.Mr Johnson was said to be considering asking the elderly to shield once again while also mulling lockdown-like conditions for London should there be a second wave of coronavirus infections, The Sundayand The Sunday Times said.Cabinet minister Mr Jenrick suggested the mooted increase in shielding was ldquonot something that is being actively considered.According to the , under proposals under discussion, a greater number of people would be asked to take part in the shielding programme, based on their age or particular risk factors that have been identied since March.It could even see those aged between  and  given ldquopersonalised risk ratings, said the Times, in a move that would add to the . million who were deemed most vulnerable and asked to shield from society during the spring peak.Mr Jenrick, when asked about whether new age-related measures were likely, told Times Radio: ldquoThis is just speculation.ldquoYou would expect the Government to be considering all of the range of options that might be available.ldquoThatrsquos not something that is being actively considered. vw,vw,px, px\"The Prime Minister has reportedly asked for officials to draw up plans on how to avoid a lockdown like that seen in the spring He also said there was ldquono plan, as far as Irsquom aware to bring in travel controls and restrictions on where Londoners could stay as part of efforts to avoid any increased transmission rate in the capital from spreading to the rest of the country.It has been suggested that, should the R-rate escalate in the capital, the M would act as a travel border for London residents and people would be banned from staying the night at houses other than their own.It comes after Mr Johnson was forced to announce a slowdown of the lockdown easing last week, with planned relaxations for the leisure and beauty sectors delayed after a rise in Covid- cases was recorded, with prevalence in the community thought to be rising for the first time since May.Meanwhile, former England midfielder Paul Scholes has been accused of holding a party at his Oldham home to celebrate his sonrsquos st on the same day lockdown measures were reimposed across parts of Englandrsquos north-west.The Sun cited phone footage as showing revellers ignoring social distancing ldquoas they drank and danced at the seven-hour party, with the paper

breach of Covid- restrictions at a residential property in the Oldham area.ldquoIn line with normal procedure and policing by consent, officers attended and engaged with an inidual, explaining the restrictions and encouraging them to be compliant.Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester, said people in his area ldquoon the whole had been brilliant and that he rejected ldquoefforts to blame some for breaking lockdown rules.Writing in the Sunday Mirror, Mr Burnham called on the Government to ensure people in low-paid, insecure jobs are financially supportedthey have to self-isolate due to coronavirus.He wrote: ldquoWe shouldnrsquot spend taxpayersrsquo money on subsidising meals out but not support the low-paid to take time off work to protect their health.While the new regulations for Blackburn with Darwen and Bradford were published on Friday, those for Greater Manchester are not expected to be published until this week.Mr Burnham has said restrictions will be reviewed on a weekly basis.Meanwhile, more than  people were said to have attended an illegal house party at Tavistock Terrace, in Archway, north London, on Friday night.The politan Police were called shortly before midnight and broke up the event in the early hours of Saturday.Footage of the event shows dozens of young people in the back garden of a terraced house not wearing masks or socially distancing.In related news, opposition MPs have accused the Government of deserting the elderly following reports ministers had abandoned their pledge to test all care home residents regularly throughout the summer.The Department of Health and Social Careadmitted there had been issues with meeting its July  deadline for testing all asymptomatic care home residents, with testing of older people and those with dementia now pushed back two months until September , the PA news agency understands.According to the Times, Professor Jane Cummings, the Governmentrsquos adult social care testing director, wrote to local authority leaders informing them that ldquopreviously advised timelines for rolling out regular testing in care homes were being altered because of ldquounexpected delays.Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ldquoWith infections rising, itrsquos frankly negligent ministers have failed to deliver on their promise to regularly test care home residents and staff.ldquoThe Government failed to protect care home residents and staff early on in this pandemic. They mustnrsquot make the same mistake again.Liberal Democrat social care spokeswoman Munira Wilson MP said: ldquoThe decision to drop the pledge to test all care home residents regularly would be a decision to desert care home residents entirely.\" data-title\"POLITICS Coronavirus\" data--holder\"PA Graphics\" data--notice\"PA Graphics Press Association Images\" data-credit\"PA Graphics\" data-usage-terms\"\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production eedeffffbbaeeYudGVudHNlYXJjaCwxNTkNDUNzM ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production eedeffffbbaeeYudGVudHNlYXJjaCwxNTkNDUNzM ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production eedeffffbbaeeYudGVudHNlYXJjaCwxNTkNDUNzM ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"A DHSC spokeswoman said: ldquoIt is completely wrong to suggest care homes were deliberately deprived of testing resources and any care home resident or member of staff with symptoms can immediately access a free test.ldquoWe continue to issue at least , tests a day to care homes across the country and prioritise tests for higher-risk outbreak areas.ldquoA combination of factors have meant that a more limited number of testing kits, predominantly used in care homes, are currently available for asymptomatic re-testing and we are working round the clock with providers to restore capacity.DHSC said it would not comment on leaked documents when asked about Prof Cummingsrsquo memo.copy -.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing! The colour and vibrancy has helped to lighten the mood of everybody in the village and those travelling through it.When in the area look out for the horse and all the displays andyou want to learn more about the work of the Cullybackey Community Partnership, ring Joanne on .

The industry reacted with disappointment to the UK government#s decision to impose a -day quarantine on tourists ing from Spain due to its growing level of coronavirus cases. The quarantine also covers Spain#s Canary and Balaeric Islands.TUI, the UK#s biggest tour operator, announced it is shutting around one third of its total of  stores.The decision was made following changes in customer behaviour, the firm said in a statement. Around  retail stores will remain following the closures. However, it would not comment on which Northern Ireland stores were at risk as a consultation is taking place.Tory MPs are putting pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to introduce coronavirus testing at airports to cut the -day quarantine.And a group of  airlines, airports and tourism leaders - including Belfast International Airport chief executive Graham Keddie - have also called on the Prime Minister to introduce virus tests for those arriving in the UK. TUI said stores which are have reopened since the pandemic are not at risk of closure. But only one of its  Northern Ireland stores - a branch at Waterloo Place in Londonderry - have so far reopened. The shutters remain down at branches in Armagh, Coleraine, Lisburn, Newtownards, Ballymena, Craigavon, Omagh, Dungannon and Newry - as well as two branches in Belfast#s CastleCourt Shopping Centre and on Bloomfield Avenue.The chain has  stores in the Republic and is based in Germany.Andrew Flintham, managing director of TUI UK and Ireland, said: We want to be in the best position to provide excellent customer service, whether it#s in a high street store, over the telephone or online, and will continue to put the customer at the heart of what we do. It is therefore imperative that we make these dficult cost decisions, look after our colleagues during such unprecedented uncertainty and also offer a modern customer service.TUI is the latest high street chain after bakery chain Greggs and bookseller Eason to indicate that it won#t reopen at least some of its shops following lockdown.Greggs is closing three of its  stores - while Eason has shut all seven of its remaining Northern Ireland stores.Glyn Roberts, the chief executive of Retail NI, hoped TUI would provide clarication on which stores will be affected by the closure plans.It#s fair to say that this was a company which was facing a signicant challenge before Covid- due to the growth in online holiday bookings, he said.And in other businesses such as Eason which have also faced troubles before Covid, Covid- has now almost finished them off.There are not just the effects from the numbers of jobs lost in retailers, but closures like TUI and Eason also had a knock-on effect as footfall into the area is diminished.The pandemic and lockdown have had a catastrophic effect on demand for overseas holidays, with many bookings cancelled after quarantine was introduced. Yesterday easyJet cancelled a number of its flights.In a letter to Mr Johnson, the bosses of British Airways, easyJet and Jet demanded a more nuanced policy than the -day quarantine.They called for the introduction of regional travel corridors to replace the blanket requirement of -day quarantine for anyone ing from an at-risk country.Transport Secretary Grant Schapps cut his family holiday in Spain short as a result. As he ed to the UK, he defended the UK government#s decision.I very much understand, it obviously had an impact on me and my family, and I#m very, very sorry and upset for the thousands of Brits who are either away or perhaps even haven#t managed to go away this summer as well to Spain, he said.But it#s absolutely essential we acted when we did, it#s why all four nations of the UK acted together and the figures since have turned out to justy that action.We have to, I think, have a clear message and make sure we act by adding entire countries to that list for the time being.People who test positive for coronavirus or display symptoms must now self-isolate for  days as Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned of a second wave starting to roll across Europe.The UK#s chief medical officers said on Thursday that the period must increase from the current rule of seven days because of the risk iniduals may still be able to spread Covid-.In a joint statement, they said the change for those who experience the key symptoms of a new continuous cough, high temperature or loss of taste or smell is needed because of the low but real possibility of infectiousness up to  days.Their move came as official analysis said England had the highest levels of excess mortality in Europe across the first half of .Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumReliance on nursing temps could jeopardise patient safety in Northern Ireland: reportPatient safety could be compromised by a reliance on temporary staff to plug gaps in Northern Ireland#s nursing and midwery sector, a report has warned.Northern Ireland PremiumBelfast#s #Breastival# in plagiarism rowThe organisers of an annual Belfast festival celebrating all things breastfeeding have expressed anger after their name was used by a well-known baby brand to promote a similar event.

On July , , Ray Cossum set off from France to swim across the English Channel. He completed the journey non-stop in a time of  hours  minutes. In doing so, he became the first Irishman to officially swim across the channel. It had been a long-held ambition for Ray. Born in Folkestone on the south coast of England in , he grew up hearing stories of people who had swam across the channel. It was an ambition he would come back to later in his adventurous le. googletag.cmd.push Ray served in the Royal Nay for eight years, five of which were in the submarine service as an escape instructor. While he was in the Navy, he was based in Derry where he met and married Bridie Loughrey, before the couple set up home and raised a family in Creggan. His love of long-distance swimming was developed and honed in the waters of Lough Swilly in Donegal where he regularly swam between Buncrana and Rathmullan. After much preparation, he decided to take his efforts to another level by attempting the channel swim he had heard so much about when growing up. googletag.cmd.push However, it was not an easy thing to achieve. He tried unsuccessfully twice to complete the swim. However, he finally realised his dream in the summer of . Almost  hours after leaving France, on July , , Ray made it back on to land near his home town of Folkstone. “I had tried to so the swim a couple of times before and on one of those times I was just a couple of miles from finishing it when I had to stop because of gale force winds,” he said. “So it was great to finally manage to swim across the channel and it was a big relief after all the training I had put in.” As a result of his success in , the local man became involved in the Channel Swimming Association which is the official body which regulates channel swims. He later went on to become vice president of the association. He remains proud of his achievement  years ago and the special relationship he has with the Englisn Channel. “I can say that I have worked as a er on the bottom of the English Channel, I have swum the channel, I was vice president of the Channel Swimming Association, I have passed through the channel in submarines, I have been through the Channel Tunnel, I have flown over the channel and passed over the channel on ships,” he said. “So I can say that I have see the channel from every angle possible.” Ray is also well-known locally for his deep-sea ing exploits. In , he bought the rights to the wreck of the SS Laurentic which sank on January ,  after striking a mine at the mouth of Lough Swilly. There were  passengers on-board the ship. Of these,  people died and only  survived. After the Laurentic sank, the Royal Navy organised a huge amount of es over subsequent decades to recover a large number of gold bars which were worth an estimated poundm in . Since buying the rights to the wreck, Ray has organised a large number of es to what remains of the vessel and had also been heavily in preserving artefacts which have been salvaged from it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Louise Campbells song Everywhere was written in March just before lockdown and recorded in her home studio in the Waterside. The single was been picked up by both Christian radio station, UCB Ireland, and Derrys Drive . And it has now been accepted to the Indie Folk Acoustic section of the UK Christian Chart  A Step Fwd, which unlike traditional charts works on an online voting system. To even have it accepted was amazing, said Louise. There are some really big established names in my category. So evenit doesnt place its great just to have that recognition. googletag.cmd.push Louise is also part of Irish music collective Wired Worship which has  members from across the North West from dferent Christian backgrounds. Although she has been involved in music from a young age, Louise had lost confidence in her singing and songwriting. But after starting to write Christian music just over a year ago, she feels she has found her voice again. I write Christian music that everyone can listen to, explained Louise. A lot of my songs are about struggling with mental health and finding acceptance and being OK with who you are. People who arent religious in any way have told me that my songs have spoken to them. googletag.cmd.push Louise is a member of All Saints Clooney, Church of Ireland church on the Limavady Road and she had recently explored the possibility of becoming an ordained minister. She was disappointed not to get through the selection process, but instead of feeling it was a rejection she now sees it as a sign that music is the right path for her. I have sung from when I was a child and dreamed of being a singer for my whole le, she said. But I had lost my confidence and I hadnt written in years. Once I started writing about my own experiences I just couldnt stop. My songs are about relatable, real experiences as a broken person who doesnt have it all together all the time. Louise is hoping to release her debut album Stumble Into Grace at the end of the year and she is funding its production by selling handcrafted items online. She has set up a crafting station in a cabin in her back garden from which she creates hand made art. I have been painting, sewing and woodburning, she said. I love to take old junk and make something beautul. Pre-lockdown, Louise was very busy with her two kids and volunteer work but after being forced to shield due to severe asthma she suddenly found herself with lots of spare time. I loved it, she said. Ive never had this amount of time to do the stuff I want to want to do, rather than the stuff I have to do. So a lot of good has come out of it, although Id like it to be under better circumstances. Louise has set up a Facebook page dedicated to her music and art and a  member strong Facebook prayer group. Im an outgoing person but Im also a complete introvert, said Louise. But now I feel like Ive got all these people behind me shoving me off the bus. Ive come to see that my own fears and insecurities arent a good enough reason not to do what Im being called to do. You can find out more about Louise at her Facebook Page Lousie Campbell-Stumbling into Grace. Louises song Everywhere is on Wired Worships album Hear which is available on iTunes, Spoty and Amazon music.

He pulled off a coup by adding Tyrone coach Gavin Devlin to a management team that includes his cousin Seamus Bradley and long-serving player Padriacuteg Kelly, who has also spent time as a senior selector. Coleraine ended their hopes for five-in-a-row and they were beaten by neighbours Glen in last years semi-final. His new captain Karl McKaigue could be set for a y spell on the sidelines after an Achilles injury in Sundays hurling victory over Ballinascreen. googletag.cmd.push Padraig Cassidy was hampered with injury during the county season, but apart from McKaigues injury the Slaughtneil boss reported a full hand to select from. He has been handed a defensive boost. Paul McNeill has ed after a troublesome shoulder injury, while there is also ato full fitness of goalkeeper Antoacutein McMullan and the versatile Barry McGuigan has emerged from retirement. Former winning captains Patsy Bradley and Francis McEldowney continue to squeeze every last drop from their stellar careers. They open their account against a Kilrea side, who are in their second season under manager Declan Bradley. The Pearses will look to the experience of Brian Oacuteg McAlary, James and Charlie Kielt to lead their youthful side, who are looking to build over the next five seasons from their recent minor winning team, who were pipped in the U final. googletag.cmd.push Larry Kielt is back in training after a cruciate ligament injury, but this first game may come too soon for his . Brian Oacuteg McAlaryand Peadar McLaughlinwill need assessed this week before Bradley makes his selection. In attack Daithi McLaughlin has been a ray of light for Kilrea and he will need support from Paddy Quigg. Three players pushing for the team are Daniel Madden, PJ McAleese and Odhran McLarnon. It is a tough opener for them and its hard to see them turning over an Emmets team looking to launch a title bid.

Kevin Brady, who played a cameo junior football role for Ogra Colmcille two seasons ago, has joined him after helping St Marys Magherafelt to MacRory Cup success. Other than a game with St Eunans, Bradley has tried in vain to get any more challenge games to put any stamp on his side, which has kept the same personnel as recent seasons. Paul Young will miss the game due to work commitments in England, while defender Connor McVey and Roddy OKane are struggling with injury. On the plus side, Derry player Jason Rocks is on his way back and could see action by the end of the group stages. googletag.cmd.push Bellaghy have John McKeever at the helm this season, who has Leo Meenan in as coach with former minor selector Kieran Glackin on board and provides a vital link to the upcoming talents from their underage production line. With goalkeeper Benny Diamond stepping aside, one of McKeevers first tasks was to find a replacement. Former Derry minor list Peter Stuart, who is an accomplished kicker, has been moulded into the role and is set to start against Loup. The Tones, under Chairman Kevin Doherty, followed the lockdown to the letter of the law, but got a few challenge games in to help prepare them. googletag.cmd.push Conan Brown hasnt came out this year and another player who wont feature is Conor Quinn, who has suffered a nasty knee injury. Lorcan Spier will miss the first two games with a suspension carried over from last season. McKeever will need to keep captain Eoghan Brown fit, who will form a partnership with the highly rated Paul Cassidy, their Ulster minor winning captain, who has recovered from injury. Along with Ronan McFaul, Odhran Lee and Conan Milne, they could be set to make their debuts in a youthful Bellaghy team, who will look to Gerard ONeill and Ryan McNally, with Peter Cassidy and Declan Brown also having championship experience.

Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added. Katies recipe ebook is available at www.brilliantbake To order from her pop up bakery email katie@gmail or visit her Brilliant Bake page on Facebook.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April.

The test site has now moved to the Lycra car rarkin Maydown. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The leaflet also called on those who participate in such immorality to repent and turn from their evil ways and included contact details for people to get in touch. Independent councillors Dan Kerr and Barry Monteith have also written to council management to ask that the listing be removed because it may promote conversion therapy. googletag.cmd.push The incident is under investigation by the PSNI. A spokesperson for the council said the directory listings had been temporarily removed. The online directory offers local business and services a listing opportunity and any inclusion should not be considered as an endorsement by the Council for any goods or services provided by any organisation, they said. However, given the issue which has now arisen, the directory section where community and voluntary organisations have registered their details, has been temporarily removed to allow us to undertake a review of the provision of the service in line with our equality commitments, and to take advice as required. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Based at the former St Josephs Parish Centre, it will be a place where theFriarscan carry out their work and welcome the local community. The extensive renovations have been funded by a number of benefactors, but the final pound, needed to complete the project was raised by the people of Derry in less than a month. googletag.cmd.push A team of volunteers have been going door to door across the city in recent weeks to collect money and explain the work of the centre, which will be opened on Wednesday, September , on the Feast Day of St Pio. Speaking on the Derry Franciscans Facebook page Fr Isaac Spinharney thanked everyone who helped them meet their fundraising goal. I want to thank every single person who donated to our Go Fund Me campaign over the last month, it was just actually four weeks, contributing to the near completion of this beautul house. Thank you so much for your generosity, its overwhelming and amazing.” googletag.cmd.push He continued: Thank you also to our volunteers. We had a solid crew of five to  who went out six days a week for about three or four weeks. We are truly grateful we could not do it without you. Fr Isaac explained how St Pio House will operate. There will be a coffee bar which will be a house of hospitality people can come and connect with their neighbours and connect with God over a cup of coffee or maybe a cup of tea. We are going to be able to host retreats and have a Praise and Worship Centre and have dferent parish activities and community activities over the months and years. Speaking to the Derry News last month, Fr Issac said the work of the new Apolistic Centre will be guided by the needs of the local community. In the  years that we have been here we have able to plug into the already existing groups and we have been so blessed to be a part of them. People have asked what sort of services will be available but we will see what needs present themselves. And we will continue to work with the organisations that we are already closely working with.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A construction company, HartlandsLtd, and Apex Housing Assocation had applied to build  houses at a large site at Springtown Road. However, planning officers recommended that the application be refused because the site was outside the current limit for housing developments as outlined in the Derry Area Plan. Planners said thatgranted planning permission, the new houses would set an undesirable precedent in terms of housing development in the countryside. The final decision on the application, however, rested with the members of Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee. googletag.cmd.push The planning application was discussed for almost two hours at a special meeting of the planning committee on Wednesday. Maura Fox, Head of Planning at the council, said she could not underestimate the signicance of the decision being made in relation to the Springtown plans. During the meeting, speaking on behalf of those behind the housing proposal, Daniel McAteer, described the Derry Area Plan as being hopelessly out of date and out of touch. He said the new houses would help to meet the critical need for social housing in the city. SDLP councillor John Boyle said he was worried about the sustainability of further development in the Springtown Road area, given the large number of houses which have been built in there in recent years. googletag.cmd.push He said there was already a high volume of traffic in the area and more housing would increase this problem. People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin said he recognised the desperate need for housing in the city but highlighted the concerns around creating a precedent in what was zoned as a rural area. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon said the new houses would help tackle the housing crisis in the city. When the issue was put to a vote, four councillors voted to support the recommendation to refuse planning permission, while three councillors voted against the recommendation.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A construction company, HartlandsLtd, and Apex Housing Assocation had applied to build  houses at a large site at Springtown Road. However, planning officers recommended that the application be refused because the site was outside the current limit for housing developments as outlined in the Derry Area Plan. Planners said thatgranted planning permission, the new houses would set an undesirable precedent in terms of housing development in the countryside. The final decision on the application, however, rested with the members of Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee. googletag.cmd.push The planning application was discussed for almost two hours at a special meeting of the planning committee on Wednesday. Maura Fox, Head of Planning at the council, said she could not underestimate the signicance of the decision being made in relation to the Springtown plans. During the meeting, speaking on behalf of those behind the housing proposal, Daniel McAteer, described the Derry Area Plan as being hopelessly out of date and out of touch. He said the new houses would help to meet the critical need for social housing in the city. SDLP councillor John Boyle said he was worried about the sustainability of further development in the Springtown Road area, given the large number of houses which have been built in there in recent years. googletag.cmd.push He said there was already a high volume of traffic in the area and more housing would increase this problem. People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin said he recognised the desperate need for housing in the city but highlighted the concerns around creating a precedent in what was zoned as a rural area. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon said the new houses would help tackle the housing crisis in the city. When the issue was put to a vote, four councillors voted to support the recommendation to refuse planning permission, while three councillors voted against the recommendation.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Oakleaf Lions will be only the second such club in Ulster, following the Titanic Tigers formation last year. “We are a group of Special Olympic volunteers and parents who are establishing a new Special Olympics club in the Oakleaf county delivering the Young Athlete programme,” read a statement on the clubs Facebook page. “It is all dependent on Covid-, but we are hoping to get a taster day between September and Christmas,” said Brian McGuigan, who has been working with Liam Oacuteg Hinphey on the venture. googletag.cmd.push “Then in the new year, we aim to have an hour session every week. At the minute, we are getting the word out there and are looking for athletes.” The programme is a play and sport activity for children from four to eight years of age with an intellectual disability. It introduces children to a wide iety of play activities in a familiar, supportive and fun environment where everyone has the opportunity to succeed. It provides a flexible framework and versatile programme which can be successfully offered in a iety of settings from inidual family home, to classrooms to community club settings - all designed as an introduction to fundamental movement skills. googletag.cmd.push The benefits of physical activity and play go beyond sports. The programme helps children interact with each other and develop communication, learning and self-help skills. It also introduces children to the Special Olympics programme and their family members to a network of support as well as preparing children for future membership into Special Olympics clubs. One of the long-term benefit of the programme is the opportunity to involve children with intellectual disabilities before they reach the age of eight. This will foster future involvement and hopefully participation in lelong sport and physical activity. If you are a parent with a child between four-eight with an intellectual disability or you want to give up some time to help out contact Brianor Maeve .  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He said the business has been in existence since , with the amount of birds at the site remaining the same.Mr Shields said the proposal is for a ldquomodern, environmentally friendly unit and explained that he finds himself in the ldquoridiculous situation where he is trying to reduce emissions from his site by  per cent.He said this is a figure which the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs agrees with, but planners are recommending that his proposal is refused, even though it is a government target to reduce emissions.ldquoWe are looking to create efficiencies on our farm so that we will be ableto market all our eggs locally, rather than rely on the wholesale market in England where the majority of our eggs are sent, he said in the letter to planners.ldquoThis new system would give signicant benefits locally in both environmental and economic terms. Ammonia levels would be reduced by up to  percent and we would be looking to employ extra people to help with the grading of eggs and deliver them locally.Mr Shields said that he can continue with the older system which will emit a lot more ammonia, which is something that the government is trying to reduce..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Shrigley children’s sports pitches due for repair scheme  ","story":"CHILDRENrsquoS sports pitches in Shrigley are to be upgraded.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council has agreed to carry out the work has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown.He has been lobbying for the upgrade in response to residentsrsquo concerns and is pleased that the football pitches used by young people who live in the village will be improved.Cllr Brown said that an existing boundary fence will be increased in height alongside the provision of additional netting to prevents stray footballs from ending up in neighbouring gardens.ldquoGoalposts will be painted and holes in the ground fixed as part of a general revamp to improve playing conditions, he said.ldquoFurthermore, no ball games will be allowed in the play park itself and new signage will be erected to reflect this.Cllr Brown said he was pleased that the local authority is open to improving the conditions of the pitch and also the additional measures to protect local houses.ldquoEspecially over summer, it is important for the younger members of our community to have adequate outdoor facilities where they can take part in sporting activities, he said.The Rowallane councillor added: ldquoI hope that the improved fence offers residents peace of mind as their properties and cars will no longer be subject to stray footballs.

Wersquore very lucky to have it and should make every effort to keep it going.Another resident described confirmation that the facility will not reopen this summer as ldquosuch a shame.She added: ldquoAs the only al open air sea pool left in Northern Ireland the Rock Pool ought to be celebrated and included in Discover Northern Irelandrsquos tourism landmark buildings and locations information. It should also be publicised in the Outdoor Swimmer Magazine.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the council took a decision to close all seasonal facilities in Newcastle, including both outdoor pools, due to Covid-.She said the decision was considered in the councilrsquos emergency business plan tabled at the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee meeting on June  and ratied at the full council meeting last month.In relation to the reopening of the indoor swimming pool at the Down Leisure Centre, the spokeswoman said the local authority was currently considering recent announcements by the Northern Ireland Executive on the reopening of pools and health suites and in relation to spectators at outdoor facilities.She added: ldquoAt present, these facilities remain closed until further notice.ldquoThe council is taking a phased approach to the reopening of its leisure facilities to ensure the safety of both staff and customers.

I was either three or four. My brother Garrett is a year younger than me. We moved from Strangford to Downpatrick when I was four-and-a-half and it was before that.My father had taken the two of us to watch a football match. Other than my mother, perhaps his five favourite things in le were reading, the crossword, conversation, a cup of tea and watching a game.What he wasnrsquot always great at was keeping a close eye on children in his charge. Between watching his old club play and chatting to a couple of the other men on the sideline, he didnrsquot notice Garrett and I making a sprint on to the pitch, looking for a go with the ball.It could well be that memory through the efflux of time has us causing greater disruption that night than actually was the case. In some ways I hope that our presence wasnrsquot even noticed by the players. It would be awful were that to have been the biggest influence that I ever had on a football match, although there is every chance that my high point was that warm evening in Kilclief.Unfortunately my enthusiasm for sport was not matched by aptitude. On one visit to his cousins in Listowel I was being encouraged to eat up my black pudding with the Kerry exhortation that I wouldnrsquot play football for Down without a good diet of black pudding.If only it had been that easy. The biggest problem was an unreliability and inconsistency in a ballrsquos direction of flight after it had been propelled by my foot, hand or implement. Allied to being short-sighted before my teens and having a slight frame, the portents werenrsquot good.Football was the game in the Red High and there were plenty of good footballers about. Kevan Owens, Ciaran McCabe and Patrick Kielty were in my year. Brian Burns the year behind. John Kielty the year ahead with Conor Deegan, Barry Breen, Mark McCartan and John Kelly a few years ahead.The recently-deceased Bro Charles was teaching in the school until my fourth year and every day hersquod put out a tea chest of hurleys for a lunchtime puck-about, which I often took advantage of. Bro Charles also coached a Downpatrick team and under his patient tutelage, and presumably need for numbers, I reached my sporting apogee with an East Down U-frac medal.What I did get from my father was the love of watching sport and going to matches. He brought me to Croke Park for the first time when I was six. It was the  football final. I was mesmerised by the colour and the noise. I know that Dublin beat Armagh that day but I honestly donrsquot remember that.What I do remember is that, for my only time, our seats were in the Ard Comhairle box. And they were soft seats. And I remember Down winning the minor match and them being given a big silver cup and I remember Daddy holding me up in his arms so that I could see it and it being so close that I tried to reach out and touch it.But it wasnrsquot all glamour. I still have yet to feel as baltic as I did one winter Sunday standing on a grass bank in the Marshes at about the age of eight or nine with the cold spreading from the frozen turf through the soles of my shoes and up my legs and Daddy talking and talking and talking as I futilely tried to will him back to the car and the warmth of home.Happier times included a spring and summer of going to watch club hurling matches. He was a member, along with Paddy OrsquoDonoghue I think, of a commission on the future of hurling in Down for the County Board and there were many trips to games, particularly to the Ards.As much as he loved football, in truth hurling was his real passion. Due maybe to a Waterford father. As a young man he had hurled for Kilclief and the county. Nothing better than a good game of hurling, hersquod say. Particularly one played in fair conditions on a firm pitch. He never got to the Munster final as often as he would have liked, but that was considered one of the great highlights of any sporting year.What we did get to and what from a young age what I was lucky enough to have as a highlight were the September trips to Croke Park for the hurling and football finals. Particularly the football finals. I got to see the great Kerry-Dublin battles, Kerryrsquos four-in-a-row, Kerryrsquos three-in-a-row.With a Kerry grandmother I felt some affinity to that great team. The Spillanes, Jack OrsquoShea, Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute, Mikey Sheehy, Bomber Liston, Ogie Moran, Charlie Nelligan. Great men. As magnicent as the modern Croke Park is, part of me will always miss the old wooden benches of the Hogan Stand.But there were green shoots beginning to appear with Downrsquos Minor All-Ireland in  followed by a narrow loss to Meath, my county of residence these last  years and more, in the  National League final. Preludes of course to theof the good old days and Downrsquos second era of greatness.I have never been at a more momentous sporting occasion than the  final.  comes close obviously, but doesnrsquot match it for the sheer joy, relief and euphoria.That match in Celtic Park is another contender. I suspect that had I been in Istanbul in  it might also have come close. I was in Cardf when Leinster came back from the dead with  unanswered second half points to win their second Heineken Cup. That too was an extraordinary day. But rsquo was in a league of its own.Those men of Kerry were heroes. But heroes in the same way as Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen and John Barnes were heroes. Itrsquos a very dferent thing when the heroes are your own people. The excitement building for weeks before. My father calling in favours from all over the country to secure extra tickets. He could nearly have opened a ticket agency.My seat that day was near the back of the Upper Cusack, two seats along from Paddy Doherty. Afterwards we made our way across the pitch and out on to Jonesrsquos Road to meet up with everyone  for the chat. At some ungodly hour on the Monday night the bus finally arrived into Downpatrick and the great Pete McGrath said that we beat the team that couldnrsquot be beaten.The last time that I went to Croke Park with my father was his last visit, three-and-a-half months before he died. It was the hurling final between his fatherrsquos county of Waterford and Galway.He had been there in  and  when they had won their two All-Irelands. He had spent childhood holidays with cousins near Dungarvan, which is where he had learnt to speak Irish. In  he had a lt by horse and cart into Tramore for the train to Dublin to watch the match.His lungs werenrsquot great at that point and I think he had greater clarity than the rest of us about how long was left. He had said to me one evening in France the month before, ldquoYou know that this is going to do for me. I knew it was, but I thought there was still a good bit leftto go.It was  years since he had brought me that first time to Croke Park when we saw Down win an All-Ireland. It would have been nice symmetry had Waterford won on his last visit but it wasnrsquot to be. The day still finished with him standing chatting to friends on Jonesrsquos Road for as long as he was able. I was happy to have been with him on that last trip.At some point in the lsquos my father stopped driving. He was probably happier with the greater opportunity for the crossword or the newspaper. My mother drove him about, but often therersquod be a lt to a match, usually with Joe Leonard. I think he went to more matches with Joe in his last couple of decades than with everyone  combined.We had started going on holidays to France in the lsquos and by the mid lsquos, by which time he had retired as Ombudsman , he and my mother were spending most of the summer there. They loved itbut,there was one downside, he missed a lot of football and hurling.Initially he relied on match reports by telephone from any of us still in Ireland. The urgency of the reports eased as his access to the internet grew but he still appreciated a call at some point to be told how the match had actually gone.The real salvation though was when their great friends, the McQuaids from Dungannon, started to come on holidays to the next town. That in itself was a good thing, but the real boon was Jimrsquos technical wizardry and ability to use a satellite dish to get RTEacute. Thereafter Jim and Maurice spent many Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons watching Jimrsquos television.I donrsquot know when I first knew of the great feats of the lsquos. I donrsquot ever remember not knowing. Whether it was the flag that my mother kept in the house with ldquoUp Down stitched across it that she had made for one of her brothers in  that my brothers and I loved to take out and wave in the garden.Or my fatherrsquos watch that had been given to him by Brian McCartan and Charlie Carr, which was engraved ldquoTo Maurice Hayes, Secretary of the Down All Ireland Football Team . From B. and C., which fascinated us as children. A watch he wore for the rest of his le and which I am wearing now as I write this.That watch made it clear that this had been something of very great import. I often think of James McCartanrsquos story of meeting his father on Jonesrsquos Road after the  final. His father was in floods of tears and said to him, ldquoYou kept your promise.The names were as familiar as our own. The McCartans and the OrsquoNeills. Paddy Doherty, Joe Lennon, Kevin Mussen, Jarlath Carey, Leo Murphy, Eddie McKay, Tony Hadden, George Lavery, Breen Morgan, Pat Rice, Patsy OrsquoHagan, PJ McElroy, John Smith and Kieran Denvir along with names like John Murphy, Peter Rooney, Larry Powell, Danny Kelly, Ray McConville, Jim Milligan and the great Colm McAlarney from later in the decade.As a boy, when people heard that I was a Hayes, Irsquod at times be askedI was Mauricersquos son and then told that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland but for him. And when Irsquod ask him about it hersquod say that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland without the players, that hersquod never kicked a ball.He spent the best part of six decades holding those men in the highest esteem, as footballers, as people, and as friends. His view was that every one of them had lived constructive lives in which they had contributed to their families, their communities and to society.And for all their achievements, they were modest men. Paddy Doherty recently selected his best Down team of all time for the Down Recorder. He didnrsquot pick himself. Paddy lsquoMorsquo is the only person in the entire country that wouldnrsquot have Paddy lsquoMorsquo on that team.Above all, he loved their company. He loved meeting up with them over the years at matches and ious s. Usually wearing his Club Down tie. Part of the pleasure of going to a match was the half-time cup of tea and the chat with friends afterwards, whether on Jonesrsquos Road, in Newry or whatever ground the match was in.There are two photographs from the GAA Congress in Newcastle ten years ago that show it well. One is a formal photograph with President McAleese and ious dignitaries. Hersquos sitting at the bottom left deep in conversation with Kevin Mussen.In the other, therersquos a group standing on a set of steps. Hersquos at the back having a chat with James McCartan. I think that Bobbie Hanvey was one of the only people that could get him to look into a camera.A third photograph from that Congress showed him standing in front of the huge poster of the  team calling them ldquoThe History Makers. That photograph was used on his memorial card. When it came to his funeral, he was buried in his Club Down tie. Nothing  would have been appropriate.His last visitor before he died was Dr Walsh, who held his hand and chatted to him. Their last words together were, ldquoWe had good times. They certainly did.This article was originally published on the Club Down website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11641007.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They aren’t open yet, so that’s why we have decided to go with the outdoor theme.”Lauren admitted she was disappointed when her original plans fell through, but the pair are hoping to have another celebration next year. “it was disappointing knowing we weren’t going to have our guests there, that was the biggest disappointment.”Instead the couple will have their wedding ceremony in her grandad Gordon Bell’s garden and will say ‘I do’ in front of Pastor Gareth Bell, who is no relation. “We are actually live streaming our ceremony from the garden. A friend volunteered to do that, which is amazing, and that way we include guests and family members who are overseas that was really important to us,” said Lauren. Due to coronavirus the young couple have also had to change their honeymoon plans. “We were due to go to Thailand, but that had to be cancelled, so we are now going to Fermanagh for the weekend and then up to the North Coast.”Then she’ll be back to teaching and is looking forward to seeing her pupils. “During lockdown one of their online tasks was to design my wedding dress. Some of them have submitted wee pictures of me on cards, which is lovely.”And Lauren confessed there are compensations to having to postpone her original wedding date. “We are planning next July to go ahead with our reception so we can have everybody there and have a big party. So, I’ll have two weddings. What bride gets to wear her dress twice  - I will!.” A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

for avoiding a second national lockdown.The Times reported the Prime Minister held a ldquowar game session with Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Wednesday to run through possible options for averting another nationwide lockdown that could stall any potential economic recovery.Mr Johnson was said to be considering asking the elderly to shield once again while also mulling lockdown-like conditions for London should there be a second wave of coronavirus infections, The Sundayand The Sunday Times said.Cabinet minister Mr Jenrick suggested the mooted increase in shielding was ldquonot something that is being actively considered.According to the , under proposals under discussion, a greater number of people would be asked to take part in the shielding programme, based on their age or particular risk factors that have been identied since March.It could even see those aged between  and  given ldquopersonalised risk ratings, said the Times, in a move that would add to the . million who were deemed most vulnerable and asked to shield from society during the spring peak.Mr Jenrick, when asked about whether new age-related measures were likely, told Times Radio: ldquoThis is just speculation.ldquoYou would expect the Government to be considering all of the range of options that might be available.ldquoThatrsquos not something that is being actively considered. vw,vw,px, px\"The Prime Minister has reportedly asked for officials to draw up plans on how to avoid a lockdown like that seen in the spring He also said there was ldquono plan, as far as Irsquom aware to bring in travel controls and restrictions on where Londoners could stay as part of efforts to avoid any increased transmission rate in the capital from spreading to the rest of the country.It has been suggested that, should the R-rate escalate in the capital, the M would act as a travel border for London residents and people would be banned from staying the night at houses other than their own.It comes after Mr Johnson was forced to announce a slowdown of the lockdown easing last week, with planned relaxations for the leisure and beauty sectors delayed after a rise in Covid- cases was recorded, with prevalence in the community thought to be rising for the first time since May.Meanwhile, former England midfielder Paul Scholes has been accused of holding a party at his Oldham home to celebrate his sonrsquos st on the same day lockdown measures were reimposed across parts of Englandrsquos north-west.The Sun cited phone footage as showing revellers ignoring social distancing ldquoas

of an earlier breach of Covid- restrictions at a residential property in the Oldham area.ldquoIn line with normal procedure and policing by consent, officers attended and engaged with an inidual, explaining the restrictions and encouraging them to be compliant.Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester, said people in his area ldquoon the whole had been brilliant and that he rejected ldquoefforts to blame some for breaking lockdown rules.Writing in the Sunday Mirror, Mr Burnham called on the Government to ensure people in low-paid, insecure jobs are financially supportedthey have to self-isolate due to coronavirus.He wrote: ldquoWe shouldnrsquot spend taxpayersrsquo money on subsidising meals out but not support the low-paid to take time off work to protect their health.While the new regulations for Blackburn with Darwen and Bradford were published on Friday, those for Greater Manchester are not expected to be published until this week.Mr Burnham has said restrictions will be reviewed on a weekly basis.Meanwhile, more than  people were said to have attended an illegal house party at Tavistock Terrace, in Archway, north London, on Friday night.The politan Police were called shortly before midnight and broke up the event in the early hours of Saturday.Footage of the event shows dozens of young people in the back garden of a terraced house not wearing masks or socially distancing.In related news, opposition MPs have accused the Government of deserting the elderly following reports ministers had abandoned their pledge to test all care home residents regularly throughout the summer.The Department of Health and Social Careadmitted there had been issues with meeting its July  deadline for testing all asymptomatic care home residents, with testing of older people and those with dementia now pushed back two months until September , the PA news agency understands.According to the Times, Professor Jane Cummings, the Governmentrsquos adult social care testing director, wrote to local authority leaders informing them that ldquopreviously advised timelines for rolling out regular testing in care homes were being altered because of ldquounexpected delays.Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ldquoWith infections rising, itrsquos frankly negligent ministers have failed to deliver on their promise to regularly test care home residents and staff.ldquoThe Government failed to protect care home residents and staff early on in this pandemic. They mustnrsquot make the same mistake again.Liberal Democrat social care spokeswoman Munira Wilson MP said: ldquoThe decision to drop the pledge to test all care home residents regularly would be a decision to desert care home residents entirely.\" data-title\"POLITICS Coronavirus\" data--holder\"PA Graphics\" data--notice\"PA Graphics Press Association Images\" data-credit\"PA Graphics\" data-usage-terms\"\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production eedeffffbbaeeYudGVudHNlYXJjaCwxNTkNDUNzM ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production eedeffffbbaeeYudGVudHNlYXJjaCwxNTkNDUNzM ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production eedeffffbbaeeYudGVudHNlYXJjaCwxNTkNDUNzM ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"A DHSC spokeswoman said: ldquoIt is completely wrong to suggest care homes were deliberately deprived of testing resources and any care home resident or member of staff with symptoms can immediately access a free test.ldquoWe continue to issue at least , tests a day to care homes across the country and prioritise tests for higher-risk outbreak areas.ldquoA combination of factors have meant that a more limited number of testing kits, predominantly used in care homes, are currently available for asymptomatic re-testing and we are working round the clock with providers to restore capacity.DHSC said it would not comment on leaked documents when asked about Prof Cummingsrsquo memo..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Expanding the shielding scheme not actively being considered  u Jenrick article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Box Two is to recycle foil paper and boxes, food and drinks cans, aerosols and cartons such as milk containers and plastics also. Box Three is for cardboard, glass bottles and jars.Bryson Recycling saysadopted it could mean a jobs boost for the area as well as making recycling easier. The firm already has a link with the council, collecting recycling from homes in the Armagh area.Eric Randall, Director at Bryson Recycling says: “We are delighted that the Council is considering the Wheelie Box option. Collected weekly, the latest Wheelie Box model will offer % more capacity than a standard green recycling bin.This is an image of what can be put in the Wheelie Boxes.“Wheelie Boxes are a very much enhanced version of the kerbside boxes which are already in use in the Armagh area. The boxes have a lockable hinged lid and are integrated onto a trolley with wheels, which makes them secure and very easy to use and move.“As well as providing more space for recycling, Wheelie Boxes will also mean good news for local jobs because % of what we collect using this approach is recycled in Northern Ireland. This compares to typically around % using green bins.”Wheelie Boxes are not new, , households in Northern Ireland already use them.Bryson Recycling also pointed out that two firms based in the borough, Huhtamaki and Cherry Pipes, used recyclable materials.A number of dferent systems are currently in operation across the Borough and the consultation aims to introduce a single, streamlined recycling system from next year.Eric adds: “The Wheelie Box option means local households can increase the amount they recycle every week instead of fortnightly, protect local jobs, boost the economy and play an important role in creating a local, sustainable environment for all.”To voice your opinion, check out the link on the ABC Council website here https:www.armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk green-bin-or-wheelie-box-choose-which-to-use "},{"url":null,"title":"autumn date set opening new south lake leisure centre ","story":"Manwho died suddenly on Sunday was father of a little girl‘He wore his great big heart openly on his sleeve’ mourners told at funeral of ‘legend’ Gary McConaghyNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleAutumn date set for opening of new South Lake Leisure CentreA date has been set for the opening of the new south lake leisure centre in Craigavon with the multi-million-pound facility to open its doors on November .By The NewsroomTuesday, th July , : pmUpdated Tuesday, th July , : pm\"\"The largest capital project to date undertaken by ABC Council, and among the largest in Northern Ireland, the new multi-use sports and leisure complex is described by the council as a major new flagship health and wellbeing destination.Work on the facility was halted by the coronavirus outbreak.
