A little boy called Willem Fogle. He was my little son. Stillborn at 8 months. A little boy I never got to know. A little life that never got to live. A breath that was never exhaled.          Ben Fogle has conquered Mount Everest, days after revealing he had taken on the ascent in memory of his stillborn son Willem. News of the successful climb was revealed on the Instagram page of former cyclist Victoria Pendleton, who was forced to abandon her own ascent earlier this month on medical grounds. She also posted a picture of Fogle (left) and his team          Fogle\u0027s climbing partner Victoria Pendleton (right) was forced to abandon the trek earlier this month on medical grounds\u0027His loss changed our lives and I think about him daily. Losing my little boy made me re-evaluate life. Not only do we hold our two beautiful children closer to us but it was a reminder to live life for the now. Don\u0027t waste it.\u0027 The trip was not without problems. He had to scale the final 2,700ft, known as the \u0027death zone\u0027, alone after his climbing partner, Pendleton, was forced to abandon the challenge.TV star Ben Fogle and ex-Olympian Victoria Pendleton start...TV adventurer Ben Fogle and former Olympic cyclist Victoria...Share this articleThe Olympic cyclist began suffering from the effects of hypoxia - oxygen deficiency - at Camp 2, 6,400 metres above sea level, and required additional oxygen to alleviate her symptoms.The double gold Olympic cyclist cheered on the team lead by experienced mountaineer, Kentoon Cool, from the side lines and posted her congratulations online when they finished: \u0027Congratulations to @benfogle@kentoncool Mark @fishercreative and the team for reaching the summit of Mount Everest thanks to @anythingispossible.world in support of @britishredcross #believe #everest2018\u0027.

Never. There is a spirituality but I can also feel the support and the love here on Instagram. There have been so many lovely messages.           Fogle offered to cancel his own ascent in solidarity but Pendelton insisted he continue to the summit with the others\u0027I am sorry that I haven\u0027t been able to reply to you all but I promise you I read your messages and once this adventure is over I will endeavour to reply to you all.\u0027Cradling little Willem to say goodbye, I made a promise to him to live my life brightly. To embrace everyday. To always smile. To be positive and to inspire. In some ways I am now living my life for two. \u0027Willem is always there. I think he is my guardian angel here. There is one particular star that shines brighter. It draws my attention. It reflects off the snow and ice. I feel so lucky. I will never take life for granted but above all I\u0027ll never be alone.\u0027          Pendleton, from Stotfold in Bedfordshire, admitted in December that she was taking part in the challenge because she was \u0027probably having a midlife crisis\u0027 Ben Fogle on Instagram: “A thank you to YOU ALL from the summit of the world @britishredcross @anythingispossible.world @unenvironment”"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/17/4C3B68BA00000578-0-image-m-105_1526572931225.jpg","title":"No wonder Meghan invited bet life theres embarrassment come","story":"     Thomas Markle Junior who has been snubbed from his sister\u0027s weddingUndoubtedly, Meghan would also want her two adored nephews — his sons Tyler and Thomas — to enjoy the occasion, along with her various uncles and aunts. And, naturally, he would receive an RSVP from the Palace, for he had ‘always supported her, she knows that’, he said, recalling how he had taken Meghan to feed the ducks and babysat for her when she was little.Oh yes — and there was bound to be ‘a plus-one for Darlene’, he added, glancing at his 36-year-old fiancée, perched at his burly shoulder and hanging on his every word.\u0027Why can\u0027t she just say she loves him?\u0027: Social media users...Does Harry need a wife or a mother? Diana¿s death left her...Royal Wedding: The celebrity guests invited to Prince Harry...\u0027I have always cared for my father\u0027: Meghan breaks her...Share this article‘I would love to meet the Royals. I’d buy the prettiest dress,’ chirruped Darlene Blount, having, apparently, forgiven Thomas for drawing a gun on her less than three months earlier, during one of their drunken, violent quarrels.Fast forward 12 months and that two-hour conversation — which I listened to again yesterday on tape — sounds utterly surreal and, on reflection, rather sad. Events in the Royal Wedding drama are moving faster even than Thomas Jnr does when someone offers to buy a round of drinks at the Cedarwood Saloon, his local bar in Grants Pass, Oregon.However, with 24 hours to go before Meghan and Harry tie the knot, the state of play is as follows: the bride’s father — shamed by the revelation that he colluded with a paparazzi photographer — now lies in a Mexican hospital, recovering from a heart operation made necessary, he claims, by his son’s bad-mouthing of Meghan.          Family at war: Meghan at 11 (far left) with her father, Samantha and nephews Tyler and ThomasMeanwhile, Thomas Jnr’s sons, Thomas, 27, who runs a Domino’s Pizza franchise with his husband, and brother Tyler, 25, a cannabis farmer (it’s legal to grow the drug in Oregon) have indeed pitched up in London (with their glammed-up mother, Tracy Dooley, in tow).Tyler plans to cash in on his association with Meghan by launching a super-strong strain of cannabis called Markle’s Sparkle.They are here to watch the wedding as ‘pundits’ in an ITV studio. Or, at least, they were until yesterday when, wisely, we might think, executives at Good Morning Britain reportedly decided to drop them.          Meghan Markle\u0027s half-brother Thomas Junior wrote a poisonous ‘open letter’ to Harry  branding his sister ‘a jaded, shallow, conceited woman  Mr Markle Jr had recently penned an ‘open letter’ and told Harry: ‘As more time passes to your royal wedding, it became very clear that this is the biggest mistake in royal wedding history\u0027As for Meghan’s paternal uncles, Bishop Fred Markle and his brother Mick, a retired diplomat, these respectable septuagenarians will remain in America, along with various other snubbed relatives.Among them is Meghan’s maternal uncle Joffre, a graphic designer, who is actually two years younger than Meghan and is the product of her late maternal grandfather Alvin’s second marriage, to a lady named Ava Burrows.As he and Meghan are a similar age, and grew up in the same neighbourhood of Los Angeles, Joffre was genuinely close to her when they were children and resumed their friendship when she was an actress in Hollywood.Though he has shown admirable discretion during the pre-wedding hoopla, declining many interview requests, he, too, has been overlooked, leaving his mother feeling understandably hurt.    Meghan Markle pictured as a baby being held by her father Thomas who will not attend the royal wedding following a heart operation          Meghan Markle (right) with her sister Samantha (left) who has been snubbed from the wedding on Saturday          Samantha Markle gave a bombshell interview to US media where she insisted she had \u0027freedom of speech\u0027 and the right to criticise her half-sister Meghan‘I want everything to work out and wish them a great day,’ Ava Burrows told me this week. ‘Even though I might not be happy about how it has been handled as far as my son is concerned.’The retired teacher added: ‘That’s my boy who’s been left out and I’m a momma bear!’So, flying in the face of Meghan’s brother’s fanciful prediction last May, it seems — apart from her mother, Doria, who is expected to walk her up the aisle tomorrow — there will be no place in the chapel for anyone in the Markle family. The one thing Thomas Jnr got right when he contemplated the likely guest list, however, was that there would not be a pew for his sister, Samantha.It wasn’t difficult to forecast her absence, though, because Samantha, 53, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair, had already portrayed Meghan as ‘narcissistic and selfish’ and claimed her half-sister had disowned her because of her disability.Since then, her rants — delivered by the U.S. celebrity news website TMZ, which has also become the chosen mouthpiece for Thomas Markle Snr — have grown more wounding and bizarre by the day.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle arrive at Windsor Castle ahead of their big dayYesterday, hitting back at Meghan’s reported pleas for her to stop sniping, she even invoked the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, saying angrily: ‘She’s not going to tell me that I can’t speak about my life. I’m not going to take it. She’s way out of her league . . . there is something in this country called freedom of speech. Meghan doesn’t have a copyright on that.’What, then, of Thomas Jnr? Having written a poisonous ‘open letter’ to Harry just over a fortnight ago, branding his sister ‘a jaded, shallow, conceited woman’ who would ‘make a joke’ of the Prince and the Royal Family and urging him to call off the ‘fake fairytale’ wedding, he appears to have had a truly Damascene conversion.The 52-year-old jobbing glazier has been flown to Britain by a redtop tabloid — no doubt, in return for yet another fat pay cheque — and was yesterday photographed posing beside one of the Queen’s guardsmen at Windsor Castle, his bleary eyes filled with awe.He now claims he hadn’t meant to hurt Meghan when he penned that cruel letter, published in a U.S. magazine, insisting he wrote it only because he and his family had been under intense pressure since the wedding was announced and he wanted to ‘shame the Palace’ into helping them.Audaciously, in his father’s absence, he is now trying to play the family’s elder statesman.  Meghan\u0027s nephew Tyler Dooley (pictured left) and his girlfriend Sandra Bazan (right) have not been invited to the wedding but were arrived at Heathrow airport on Monday          Megan\u0027s sister-in-law Tracey and nephew Tyler Dooley are pictured leaving a hotel in Waterloo‘The fact Dad’s not well enough to travel makes me want more than ever to be as supportive as I can to Meg,’ he drawled. ‘All I want is to see Meg happy and I hope she has found that with Harry.’Forgetting that he shared the family home with Meghan only briefly, when he was a teenager, and hasn’t spoken to his half-sister for many years, he added: ‘Knowing her as well as I do, and despite her job, there will be no acting on Saturday for sure. She’ll be unable to hide her happiness.’Quite what Meghan must be feeling as she prepares for the biggest day of her life, knowing her troublesome brother and various members of his clan lurk not a million miles from St George’s Chapel, we can but imagine.From the tranquillity of her home in the Californian desert — where I visited her last year — Ava Burrows summed up the car crash events of recent days with customary sagacity: ‘Family dynamics can be trying under normal circumstances but, in this family, under these circumstances, they are just plain crazy.’Weary of the hype, incidentally, Mrs Burrows has decided against getting up at 3am, West Coast time, to watch the wedding.           Tracey\u0027s son Tyler is developing a strain of cannabis called \u0027Markle\u0027s Sparkle\u0027 in the US state of Oregon, known for its relaxed drug laws    Tyler with his girlfriend Sandra (left) and with his mother Tracy, rightIndeed, though she will record the televised coverage for her invalid mother, who lives with her, she says she might never view it.The same goes for Meghan’s Uncle Mick, the retired diplomat.Puzzled and upset at being ignored (not least because he used his influence to get Meghan an internship at the U.S. Embassy in Argentina after she graduated), the 78-year-old, who lives in Florida, five time zones back from London, has also decided against setting his alarm.Whatever we might think of Meghan’s decision to exclude her family — be they blameless or otherwise — it means we can expect a scene of stark disparity in the chapel tomorrow.The right-hand side, where the groom’s contingent traditionally sit, will be packed with Harry’s family members, close and distant. The left, reserved for the bride’s guests, is likely to be filled with her high-flown new circle of friends, such as tennis queen Serena Williams, Jessica Mulroney, daughter-in-law of the former Canadian prime minister, and her co-stars in the TV drama Suits.          Thomas Markle admitted to staging  paparazzi photos (pictured) with an agency for money          Thomas Markle is seen on surveillance video entering an internet cafe with photographer Jeff Rayner to set up staged photosOn which side of the chapel David and Victoria Beckham will be seated, we can’t be sure. For those unacquainted with the Markle family’s chequered history, perhaps I should explain how this extraordinary state of affairs came about.The Markles are ided by many long-standing feuds, but the most bitter is between Thomas Jnr and Samantha, who loathe one another with a vengeance.The children of Meghan’s father’s first marriage, they were raised in Chicago — where Thomas Snr worked as a TV lighting technician — but when they were very young, their parents orced and they moved to live in the backwoods of New Mexico with their mother, Roslyn.Thomas Snr, meanwhile, decamped to Hollywood, working on the hit TV series Married With Children and marrying Meghan’s mother, Doria, 12 years his junior, who was temping at the studio.When Samantha was in her early teens, with visions of forging an acting career, she went to live with them, followed by Thomas Jnr.            The future princess\u0027 family are a mix of colourful characters that include a reformed alcoholic, a bishop, and even a cannabis farmerAs I learned when researching Meghan’s life story, however, the arrangement was a disaster from the outset. By many accounts, Samantha was deeply jealous of her baby half-sister (though she strenuously denies this), feeling that Meghan was claiming all her father’s attention.Matters worsened as Meghan grew older and her acting career began to blossom — while Samantha’s foundered.According to Roslyn, 71, Samantha is ‘not a nice person’ and also resented Doria, allegedly telling friends her stepmother was ‘the maid because she is black’.Samantha has since had an unhappy life. She was first married to a lawyer from Virginia, but they split up and he took custody of their two children.Her second marriage was also a failure, and her third child, daughter Noel, 19, despises her.She claims to have been a model and actress, though, if we believe her brother, she only ever had one or two bit-parts, courtesy of her father, and one modelling assignment, for a jeans commercial.Thomas Jnr says she also worked as a shop assistant, before joining the U.S. Air Force, but claims that she has sponged shamelessly off her father, contributing to his recent bankruptcy.With a tell-all book about Meghan in the pipeline, Samantha now calls herself a writer and ‘mental health counsellor’. She was diagnosed with MS in 2008.Thomas Jnr’s life has been no less difficult. After working as a lowly-paid Hollywood prop-shifter (again, thanks to his father’s connections), he drifted from job to job, and woman to woman, before marrying Tracy.  On the go: Meghan\u0027s mother Doria was picked up at her California home as she made her way to LAX on TuesdayThough they had two sons, Tyler and Thomas — or ‘TJ’, as he is known — he says the relationship was so fraught that they lived ‘as man and wife’ for only a few months.As Tracy is reportedly a recovering alcoholic, and he has long-standing problems with drink, this isn’t surprising.In fairness, Tracy has sprung to her ex-husband’s defence in recent months, not least when he was arrested for threatening Darlene with a gun. But TJ is less forgiving, saying he feels humiliated by his father’s erratic behaviour, and his outbursts about Meghan, and that his father and aunt Samantha are both ‘crazy’.Given the goings-on in recent days, we might think this something of an understatement — and you can bet your life there is plenty more embarrassment to come from the madcap Markles.Perhaps Meghan is wondering whether she should have invited the whole sorry lot of them. After all, it might have been better to have these loose cannons inside the wedding hall, rather than taking pot shots from outside."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/14/4C661F4100000578-5742749-image-a-57_1526650912733.jpg","title":"Smiling fianc e flashing ring Meghan leaves family drama behind","story":"    Meghan Markle and Prince Harry smile and wave as they leave their Kensington Palace home to head to Windsor today.

The Duke was taken to the private King Edward VII hospital in central London on April 3, for surgery to replace his joint with a prosthetic implant.He underwent the planned procedure the following day and left hospital on April 13.The duke, who retired from royal duties in August 2017, has since continued his recovery in Windsor.His appearance at tomorrow\u0027s wedding will please the royal fans, with whom he is extremely poplar.                                                     Yesterday they witnessed a full rehearsal in which a carriage and members of the armed forces paraded through the streets of Windsor. Meghan has pleaded for her 73-year-old father, who is recovering from heart surgery in Mexico after revelations about his alleged collusion with a paparazzi photographer, to be given \u0027space\u0027. In the statement, which she is said to have written herself, Miss Markle, 36, said: \u0027Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.\u0027I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u0027I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u0027 The actress also appeared to reject criticism by her siblings that she had failed to do enough to support the reclusive Thomas Markle, saying she had \u0027always cared\u0027 for him. However, her mother, Doria Ragland, who will accompany her to the chapel and who is due to meet the Queen today, is tipped for the role. Miss Markle\u0027s future father-in-law, Prince Charles, and her closest male friend, Soho House director Markus Anderson, have also been mooted.Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.    The Prince of Wales is at Buckingham Palace today where he made author and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg,  a Companion of Honour as news emerged he will give Meghan away          Excitement ahead of the wedding is reaching fever pitch today as Americans and Brits pose outside Windsor Castle      It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.          Police marksmen on the ground and on rooftops have to do \u0027whatever it takes\u0027 to keep people safe tomorrowIn return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.Kensington Palace declined, however, to confirm when Miss Markle had last seen her father or when she planned to see him next. They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles.The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.

They will be waved off on their carriage procession through Windsor by members of both families. The congregation will file out of the chapel to see the newlyweds leave before heading to St George’s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.The carriage procession through the streets of Windsor is expected to take about 25 minutes.7pmThe reception is not being televised and neither is the evening reception at Frogmore House, but viewers will get another glimpse of the royal couple when they leave Windsor Castle at 7pm for the evening do, which is hosted by the Prince of Wales.       Prince Charles, who walked family friend Alexandra Knatchbull down the aisle at her wedding in 2016, will step in for Thomas Markle, it was announced this morningThe Prince of Wales is no stranger to walking down non-relations down the aisle.He gave away Princess Diana\u0027s goddaughter Alexandra Knatchbull at her wedding to Thomas Hooper in 2016, as her own father looked on.At the time some speculated that Lord Brabourne, a close friend of the Prince and the grandson of Earl Mountbatten, was in poor health.Others suspected strained relations between Alexandra, goddaughter of Princess Diana, and her father could go some way towards explaining why a bride from one of Britain’s most established families chose to break with tradition.In 2010 Norton Knatchbull, the eighth Baron Brabourne, abandoned his 31-year marriage to run away to Nassau in the Bahamas with fashion designer Jeannie Nuttall.When this relationship ended in 2014 and he returned to the historic estate –where Noel Coward played the piano at weekend house parties – he was banished from the house to live in a converted barn.                                                       Snipers on the streets: Security forces build a £30MILLION taxpayer-funded ring of steel around Windsor as 100,000 superfans descend on the town for Harry and Meghan\u0027s big daySnipers are on rooftops today with soldiers and armed police patrolling the streets below as a £30million ring of steel today surrounds Windsor Castle ahead of the royal wedding.Police, the Army and undercover members of the security services are ready \u0027do whatever is necessary\u0027 to prevent any attack on Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day, including shooting to kill.The 2.6-mile route the couple will travel from St George\u0027s Chapel to Windsor Castle is lined with sharpshooters on top of buildings and other vantage points. Specialist teams are also patrolling the Thames.Police and soldiers carrying automatic weapons will also line the streets ready to fire if necessary and are already patrolling the roads, which have crash barriers used to stop vehicle-based terror attacks.With the UK\u0027s terror threat level at severe the cost of security for the first major royal wedding since 2011 is expected to reach up to £30million and the bill will be picked up by the taxpayer.It is Thames Valley Police\u0027s biggest ever operation and they are relying heavily on Scotland Yard and MI5 for support.It came as superfans camped on the streets overnight to secure their spots to see the procession through the Berkshire town tomorrow.              Police teams are even patrolling Windsor along the Thames today in an  extraordinary security operation ahead of the royal wedding    Police spotters and snipers are lining the 2.6mile route set to be followed by Meghan and Harry and are ready to shoot to kill            A police officer watches on from the rooftops of Windsor during one of Britain\u0027s biggest security operations for years            Soldiers have also been drafted in to secure a ring of steel around Windsor Castle ahead of the biggest UK royal wedding since 2011            Armed officers are on patrol and MailOnline understands there also undercover officers and MI5 ready to act if needed            Superfans camped on the streets overnight to secure their spots to see the procession through the Berkshire town tomorrowArmed police and specially trained sniffer dogs are patrolling the streets of  the royal town, with squadrons of uniformed officers with machine guns toured the town in rotation.Their colleagues are checking drains, bins and any other potential hiding places for bombs as the Berkshire town was turned into a fortress.Thames Valley Police and the Metropolitan Police - who guard the Royals –  used the dress rehearsal yesterday to assess any potential security threats or bottlenecks and crowd surges.As many as 100,000 visitors are expected to flock to the Berkshire town this weekend - which has a population of 35,000 - to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds.  Wedding planning service Bridebook say it could cost as much as £32million to ensure the event remains safe.The amount is more than double the security needed for the 1981 wedding between Prince Charles and Diana Spencer which was estimated to have cost £4million - which equates to around £12million today.Extra police from around Britain are being called upon to help ensure the event goes off without a hitch, as crowds will fill Windsor to catch a glimpse of the royals.  Since Prince William’s wedding the UK has experienced a surge in terror threats, meaning the cost of Harry’s nuptials outside of the city will be much higher.The couple’s decision to invite more than 2,000 members of the public to attend celebrations at Windsor Castle has also increased security costs. The Queen revealed has said she and the rest of the royal family will pay for the traditional wedding costs like the ceremony, flowers, music and the reception - but security is likely to be paid in full for by the taxpayer.             A police boat cruises the Thames in Windsor today as part of the £30m operation to keep the event secure            Sniffer dogs are checking the streets while police are checking drains and removing bins to stop any attack on the royal wedding            Crash barriers are also in place in Windsor to stop a terrorist attacking crowds using a vehicle  \u0027Prince Charles doesn\u0027t have a daughter so he must be VERY happy\u0027: Social media overflows with praise for Meghan\u0027s \u0027touching\u0027 decision to ask her father-in-law to give her away... although feminists claim the decision is \u0027sexist\u0027Royal fans today spoke of their joy for Prince Charles after it was revealed he will step in for the father of the bride and walk Meghan Markle down the aisle.The Prince of Wales will give his soon-to-be daughter-in-law away when she marries Prince Harry tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle.Meghan, 36, asked her future father-in-law to accompany her on the way to the altar after her father Thomas Markle had to pull out following heart surgery.Responding to the announcement by Kensington Palace this morning, royal fans praised the \u0027fantastic\u0027 decision and said they were delighted for Charles.             Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince CharlesOne said: \u0027What a lovely thing. Charles himself has no biological daughters but he will definitely be gaining one tomorrow. It will be a very touching moment.\u0027Another from New South Wales, Australia, tweeted: \u0027What a wonderful blessing for them both. Something Charles thought he would never be able to do.\u0027Her mother may not have been comfortable doing this. Whatever the reason, it is fantastic. Many blessings and prayers for both Harry and Meghan.\u0027And a third said: \u0027I knew it would be Prince Charles. I was hoping for her mum to do it, but I guess she wanted to keep things as traditional as possible. Great choice!\u0027However, not everyone was happy with the announcement. Aimee Day tweeted: \u0027No, it should have been her mum to do it. She brought her up and she should do it.             Others are not so impressed by the decision, with some claiming it is a \u0027sexist\u0027 move\u0027In general I think the mother\u0027s should do it anyway. After all, in most situations the mother does everything for their child over the father - in my experience.\u0027And Rachel Douce added: \u0027Disappointing that Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Perfect opportunity for the royals to show how modern and not sexist they are and let Doria do it, but no.\u0027Mr Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The actress\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role. But Harry\u0027s father is far more experienced at appearing at big public events amid scrutiny.Wedding-watchers camped outside Windsor Castle in readiness for the festivities said they felt her soon-to-be father-in-law stepping in was a \u0027nice gesture\u0027.The announcement from Kensington Palace on Friday morning came with just 24 hours to go until the big day, with final preparations well under way in Windsor. Windsor visitor Leslie Haynes, from Washington, said: \u0027I was surprised actually. I knew that Prince Charles was in the running. I just assumed it would be her mother.\u0027But it was Meghan\u0027s approval and choice and so we support that, and, as we say, the next King of England is going to walk her down the aisle.\u0027The 58-year-old, who is camping  opposite the castle, said she was \u0027somewhat\u0027 disappointed that Miss Ragland would not accompany Meghan to the altar.She added: \u0027But I have to say that it\u0027s her choice so we\u0027re happy for her. She is going to be the happiest woman in the world tomorrow so how could we be disappointed about that?\u0027Margaret Phipps, 25, from Texas, said: \u0027She has such a close relationship with her mum, so I think it is surprising to some people. But I think it\u0027s a nice gesture. \u0027He (Charles) doesn\u0027t have a daughter that he\u0027d ever be able to walk down the aisle. And it just sort of shows her transition into the royal family.\u0027She\u0027s really becoming a part of that family with him kind of acting as the father figure in situations, so I personally think it\u0027s nice.\u0027Sylvia Horn, 61, from Nashville, said it is \u0027wonderful\u0027, adding: \u0027It\u0027s usually a gentleman that does it.\u0027 \u0027I fully approve since Charles is going to be her father-in-law,\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/23/4C5B4EE100000578-0-image-a-77_1526596043183.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles mother Doria afternoon tea Queen today","story":"Doria (left, leaving her home in LA on Tuesday, is supporting her daughter through the continuing drama over her father Thomas Markle\u0027s involvement in the wedding and has enjoyed a \u0027jolly\u0027 afternoon with Charles and Camilla (right at Kensington Palace yesterday)  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle looked relaxed as their Range Rover took them from Windsor Castle after the rehearsal          The Queen travelled to Windsor from Buckingham Palace to help the couple with their final wedding preparations and wiull meet Doria later today   Doria Ragland, pictured with Meghan, was whisked off to the royal residence after arriving in the UK yesterdayHarry, as is tradition, will say goodbye to wife-to-be and stay elsewhere with his best man, Prince William.The princes have plumped for Coworth Park, a five-star country house a stone’s throw from Windsor and one that has been the venue for many a royal polo match and his first public kiss with Meghan.Doria Ragland has had the royal red carpet rolled out for her ahead of the royal wedding on Saturday.She has been staying at Kensington Palace, has already enjoyed a \u0027very jolly\u0027 afternoon with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, just hours after landing, and yesterday met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children.      EXCLUSIVE: Suits star checks out his wedding suit!

Staying in the hospital a few more days. Not allowed to get excited\u0027 and his children said he is \u0027heartbroken\u0027 to miss the wedding.Mr Markle said his doctors needed to \u0027go in and clear blockage, repair damage, and put a stent where it is needed\u0027 during the operation.His daughter Samantha, who has a poor relationship with Meghan, claims her father is \u0027upset and alone\u0027 following his surgery.But there is some confusion over his care as sources close to the Markle family said he had already been diagnosed with a heart condition and was due to undergo planned surgery to fit a stent, the same operation Prince Philip underwent in 2011, early next week – on his return from London.Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.   It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.In return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.Kensington Palace declined, however, to confirm when Miss Markle had last seen her father or when she planned to see him next. They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles. The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.TMZ yesterday said it had again been in touch with Mr Markle. Journalist Sean Mandell said Miss Markle\u0027s father had told him: \u0027It will take a long time to heal. I\u0027m okay. Staying in the hospital a few more days.

Meghan Markle imagined here wearing the gown she is rumoured to wear on her wedding day, at the Ralph \u0026amp Russo fashion show at Paris Fashion WeekWill Meghan’s wedding dress impact the bridal industry?Meghan, like Kate Middleton, is likely to choose a dress from a British brand in order to curry favour with the public and in turn, boost the nation’s valuable fashion and bridal industries.Despite the Meghan Markle effect being an industry in itself, being valued at £150 million to the British fashion industry in the form of unofficial brand endorsements, the new Royal’s impact on the bridal industry may be more subtle.After Kate Middleton’s marriage to Prince William, some bridal designers decided to replicate the Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen dress with hopes that all those who had watched the Royal Wedding would want to purchase a wedding dress similar to hers.According to Lori Conley, Senior Vice President of Product and Design at David’s Bridal, the recreated dress with lace sleeves, plunging neckline and full skirt did not sell. ‘We have internal benchmarks we work with to understand traction of a dress. It feel below those.’While women were inspired by Kate’s look, they did not want to feel as if they were in a costume, so bridal designers are expected to take elements from Meghan’s dress after May 19 and incorporate them in their new collections.However, before the 2011 Royal Wedding, 75 per cent of wedding dresses that David’s Bridal sold were strapless, but after, around 65 percent of brides opted for something with more coverage, from straps to full sleeves.          Kate Middleton seen here on her wedding day with her Maid of Honour and sister Pippa Middleton at Westminster Abbey in LondonIn the same way, Kate’s second wedding dress sparked an interest in sashes, Brides magazine Deputy Digital Director Roberta Correia told Racked that bridal designers are still being influenced by this accessory seven years on.‘Long sleeves, V-necks, and lace have been seen all over the bridal runways since, even at the most recent Bridal Fashion Week. H\u0026ampM released a new dress as part of their wedding collection, which looked almost exactly like Kate’s,’ Roberta said.Although there is high consumer interest in what Meghan wears, trend adoption is slower in the bridal industry, but some brands, like minimalist brand Floravere have already announced that they will have styles inspired by the dress ready within days of the Royal Wedding.Floravere CEO Molly Kang said: ‘As soon as she goes down the aisle, we can see what’s going to explode, whether it’s silhouette, fabric, or neckline.’Royal Wedding dressesWhile Meghan has somewhat disregarded the unspoken Royal dress code when it comes to her day-to-day fashion, she is expected to go for a traditional and classic bridal gown for her big day, similar to what other Royal brides have worn before her.The Queen’s wedding dressQueen Elizabeth II wore a timeless dress designed by the favoured royal couturier Norman Hartnell for her marriage to Lord Philip Mountbatten.The Duchesse ivory silk-creation took three months to complete and had a heart-shaped neckline with a scalloped edge, crystals and a 13 foot patterned train. Like all British brides at the time, the Government gave her 200 extra clothing coupons towards her wedding trousseau.

Princess Margaret and Anthony Armstrong Jones seen here on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on their wedding day with one of the Princess\u0027s bridesmaidsPrincess Diana’s wedding dressAt the time, Lady Diana Spencer’s wedding dress was known as the ‘most closely guarded secret in fashion history’.Designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, the meringue style gown was worth £9,000 in 1981 and is now valued at approximately £36,800.For her wedding to Prince Charles, Diana’s dress was made of ivory silk taffeta and antique lace with what has now become an iconic 25 foot train.

Shortly afterwards, when asked how he was feeling, he said: \u0027Great, thanks. How are you feeling?\u0027Meghan O\u0027Shea, aged seven, from Holyport in Berkshire, was among those who chatted with Harry.The prince noted the \u0027H\u0027 in the little girl\u0027s name - like his soon-to-be wife Meghan - and she said he remarked: \u0027Is that like the one I\u0027m going to marry? There\u0027s not very many Meghans with a \u0027H\u0027 around.\u0027Little Meghan said of her namesake: \u0027I think she\u0027s very nice.\u0027 As Harry was returning to the castle, he spotted a friend in the crowd who has made it home from a big cycling trip just in time for the wedding.Dean Stott, 41, travelled the 14,000-mile Pan American Highway in 99 days, 12 hours and 56 minutes, knocking an astonishing 17 days off the previous best. The former special forces soldier trained with the prince for six weeks in 2007 and the pair have stayed close, with the groom-to-be finding time to congratulate his guest on the record-breaking achievement.Afterwards Mr Stott said it was the first time he and Harry had seen each other since he returned, adding that he had not quite realised the magnitude of the wedding. Mr Stott said he was \u0027honoured and privileged\u0027 to be attending the wedding.   Accompanied by his older brother, Harry was met with loud cheers from the crowd as he emerged from the castle wearing a grey jacket, white shirt and slacks          \u0027I just want to go to the pub!\u0027: Harry pointed at the Horse and Groom pub behind adoring fans and photographers in Windsor this evening           Harry and Meghan are pictured among a crowd of well-wishers in the groom\u0027s final public appearance as a single man          Harry holds a teddy bear with a red jumper as he and Prince William greet crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening  Prince Harry walks around in front of Windsor Castle as he greeted well-wishers on his last evening of bachelorhoodAt tomorrow\u0027s service the bride  will walk through the Nave and Prince Charles will be waiting  at the start of the Quire - half way down the chapel - to take her to the altar.A source told MailOnline: \u0027It was something that she made clear she wanted to do when she and Prince Harry started planning their wedding last November\u0027.Many royal fans appear delighted at Meghan\u0027s decision because Charles does not have a daughter - but some critics believe the star, 36, should have plumped for Doria.The dramatic twist came as Prince Philip, 96, confirmed he will be well enough to attend the ceremony after successfully recovering from a hip operation last month. Harry\u0027s father is vastly more experienced than Doria at appearing at large-scale public events amid intense scrutiny. He also performed the duty for Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016. Meghan\u0027s father Thomas Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.       One member of the adoring crowd gave Harry what is possibly his and Meghan\u0027s first wedding present - a fluffy teddy bear    Outside the Horse and Groom pub, Harry shook hands with fans and spoke to children in the crowd while well-wishers filmed his every move on their mobile phones           Prince Harry is given the teddy bear by one of his well-wishers outside Windsor Castle this eveningPrince Harry and Meghan arrive at Windsor Castle for rehearsalSoldiers leave Victoria Barracks ready for royal wedding rehearsalPetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own landPrince Harry and Meghan ready for wedding rehearsal in WindsorHarry and Meghan arrive in Windsor for royal wedding\u0027s full rehearsal\u0027People will be disappointed\u0027: Robert Lacey on Prince Charles decisionThe Queen is seen driving to Windsor ahead of royal weddingPosh smiles!

The Duke was taken to the private King Edward VII hospital in central London on April 3, for surgery to replace his joint with a prosthetic implant.He underwent the planned procedure the following day and left hospital on April 13.The duke, who retired from royal duties in August 2017, has since continued his recovery in Windsor.His appearance at tomorrow\u0027s wedding will please the royal fans, with whom he is extremely poplar.                                                     Last night royal fans were seen camping out outside the castle to ensure a good view of the planned procession, using sleeping bags and even folding chairs after local police banned tents. Yesterday they witnessed a full rehearsal in which a carriage and members of the armed forces paraded through the streets of Windsor. Meghan has pleaded for her 73-year-old father, who is recovering from heart surgery in Mexico after revelations about his alleged collusion with a paparazzi photographer, to be given \u0027space\u0027. In the statement, which she is said to have written herself, Miss Markle, 36, said: \u0027Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.\u0027I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u0027I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u0027 Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.  It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.In return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.            A man puts a flag up above a shop featuring Harry and Meghan decorations in Windsor ahead of the royal wedding           People with Canadian flags camp out in Windsor ahead of the wedding of Harry and Meghan tomorrow          A group of royal wedding enthusiasts hold up flags and Harry and Meghan memorabilia outside Windsor Castle  The Royal Standard flies over Windsor Castle showing the Queen is in residence with the tow below a sea of Union Flag bunting today          In the town huge crowds of people have gathered on the eve of Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding in the grounds of the castlePolice, the Army and the security services are forming a £30million ring of steel to protect the couple and the 100,000 people expected to visit the Berkshire town - but some armed officers took the time to pose with some Meghan fans  Royal fans from Britain, America and around the world are gathering outside Windsor Castle in huge numbers today with many wearing flags, costumes and hats          Sniffer dogs protect the huge numbers in Windsor today as part of the biggest security operation of recent times          One lucky bride, Vicky Compson, got to feel what it was like to be a princess for the day when she walked through the route Meghan and Harry will follow  to her own wedding today          Newlyweds Vicky and Aron Hallam then smiled after sharing a kiss during their reception at the Prince Harry pub in Windsor           Isabelle Sherlock and Charlie Twitchett, both ten, play Meghan Markle and Prince Harry for the day as they leave Fleetwood Methodist Church in Lancashire as  hundreds of primary school children staged their own version of the royal wedding today  Will Shepherd and Sienna Harrison, four-year-old cousins, played Harry and Meghan for the day at a nursery in Orrell, Wigan          School children wave flags on the Long Walk ahead of the wedding of the year tomorrow    Meghan and Harry will spend the evening apart this evening and the next time they will see each other again will be at the altar           Charles and Camilla were pictured leaving Kensington Palace by helicopter yesterday and this may have been when Meghan asked her future father-in-law if he would step in  This is how Meghan\u0027s entrance to St George\u0027s Chapel will unfold tomorrow and how Charles will meet her halfway          Kensington Palace has said that the Prince of Wales will accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel (pictured          Prince Charles said today he was \u0027pleased to welcome her to the royal family in this way\u0027, Kensington Palace revealed in a shock statement that also suggested Meghan could enter the church alone and meet Charles half way          Charles is said to be very fond of Meghan (pictured together on Christmas Day at Sandringham) and was happy to help her after her father caused a crisis ahead of her wedding            Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince Charles, but others have also said Meghan should have asked her mother Doria Meghan\u0027s mother Doria (pictured left in LA) was expected to give her daughter away.

They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles.The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince.

A police boat cruises the Thames in Windsor today as part of the £30m operation to keep the event secure            Sniffer dogs are checking the streets while police are checking drains and removing bins to stop any attack on the royal wedding          The Quire in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Charles will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle tomorrowThe prince and Ms Markle\u0027s reception will be held in the castle\u0027s 180ft (55m) long St George\u0027s Hall, traditionally used for glittering state banquets.The vast hall had to be restored following the devastating fire at the castle in 1992.The chapel, with its intricately carved stonework, magnificent fan vaulted ceiling and beautiful stained glass windows, has seen many royal weddings and funerals.The last royal wedding was for Harry\u0027s cousin, Peter Phillips, son of the Princess Royal, who married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008.Harry\u0027s father and stepmother, the Duchess of Cornwall, had their televised religious blessing there in 2005, after their civil ceremony down the road in Windsor\u0027s Town Hall.In 1999, Harry\u0027s uncle, the Earl of Wessex, married Sophie Rhys-Jones, now the Countess of Wessex, at St George\u0027s.Royal newlyweds and their families traditionally pose for photographs afterwards on the vast west steps, as Harry and his new bride are certain to do.It has been the setting for many historic funerals including the Queen Mother\u0027s private committal service following her Westminster Abbey funeral in 2002, and in the same year, Princess Margaret\u0027s small, private funeral.The funeral of the Queen\u0027s father, King George VI, took place at St George\u0027s in 1952.Like Westminster Abbey, the chapel is known as a Royal Peculiar, with the Dean of Windsor responsible only to the sovereign.The church, a place of worship for the Queen and her family, is often at the heart of royal events, with the Windsors gathering there each year for Easter services, and in the past for occasions such as the service to mark the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s 90th birthday.Within the chapel are the tombs of 10 sovereigns - as well as George VI, the remains of Edward IV, Henry VI, Henry VIII and his third wife Jane Seymour, the beheaded Charles I, George III, George IV, William IV, Edward VII and George V also rest there.                           \u0027Prince Charles doesn\u0027t have a daughter so he must be VERY happy\u0027: Social media overflows with praise for Meghan\u0027s \u0027touching\u0027 decision to ask her father-in-law to give her away... although feminists claim the decision is \u0027sexist\u0027Royal fans today spoke of their joy for Prince Charles after it was revealed he will step in for the father of the bride and walk Meghan Markle down the aisle.The Prince of Wales will give his soon-to-be daughter-in-law away when she marries Prince Harry tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle.Meghan, 36, asked her future father-in-law to accompany her on the way to the altar after her father Thomas Markle had to pull out following heart surgery.Responding to the announcement by Kensington Palace this morning, royal fans praised the \u0027fantastic\u0027 decision and said they were delighted for Charles.             Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince CharlesOne said: \u0027What a lovely thing. Charles himself has no biological daughters but he will definitely be gaining one tomorrow. It will be a very touching moment.\u0027Another from New South Wales, Australia, tweeted: \u0027What a wonderful blessing for them both. Something Charles thought he would never be able to do.\u0027Her mother may not have been comfortable doing this. Whatever the reason, it is fantastic. Many blessings and prayers for both Harry and Meghan.\u0027And a third said: \u0027I knew it would be Prince Charles. I was hoping for her mum to do it, but I guess she wanted to keep things as traditional as possible. Great choice!\u0027However, not everyone was happy with the announcement. Aimee Day tweeted: \u0027No, it should have been her mum to do it. She brought her up and she should do it.             Others are not so impressed by the decision, with some claiming it is a \u0027sexist\u0027 move\u0027In general I think the mother\u0027s should do it anyway. After all, in most situations the mother does everything for their child over the father - in my experience.\u0027And Rachel Douce added: \u0027Disappointing that Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Perfect opportunity for the royals to show how modern and not sexist they are and let Doria do it, but no.\u0027Mr Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The actress\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role. But Harry\u0027s father is far more experienced at appearing at big public events amid scrutiny.Wedding-watchers camped outside Windsor Castle in readiness for the festivities said they felt her soon-to-be father-in-law stepping in was a \u0027nice gesture\u0027.The announcement from Kensington Palace on Friday morning came with just 24 hours to go until the big day, with final preparations well under way in Windsor. Windsor visitor Leslie Haynes, from Washington, said: \u0027I was surprised actually. I knew that Prince Charles was in the running. I just assumed it would be her mother.\u0027But it was Meghan\u0027s approval and choice and so we support that, and, as we say, the next King of England is going to walk her down the aisle.\u0027The 58-year-old, who is camping  opposite the castle, said she was \u0027somewhat\u0027 disappointed that Miss Ragland would not accompany Meghan to the altar.She added: \u0027But I have to say that it\u0027s her choice so we\u0027re happy for her. She is going to be the happiest woman in the world tomorrow so how could we be disappointed about that?\u0027Margaret Phipps, 25, from Texas, said: \u0027She has such a close relationship with her mum, so I think it is surprising to some people. But I think it\u0027s a nice gesture. \u0027He (Charles) doesn\u0027t have a daughter that he\u0027d ever be able to walk down the aisle. And it just sort of shows her transition into the royal family.\u0027She\u0027s really becoming a part of that family with him kind of acting as the father figure in situations, so I personally think it\u0027s nice.\u0027Sylvia Horn, 61, from Nashville, said it is \u0027wonderful\u0027, adding: \u0027It\u0027s usually a gentleman that does it.\u0027 \u0027I fully approve since Charles is going to be her father-in-law,\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/15/4C657D1100000578-5745179-image-a-17_1526653536757.jpg","title":"Frail Yoko Ono visits John Lennons childhood homes Liverpool","story":"Yoko Ono visited Liverpool on Friday in order to open a new exhibition dedicated to her relationship with John Lennon before spending some time at two of his childhood homes, including Mendips (pictured)          Lennon moved to Mendips, at 251 Menlove Avenue, after his parents\u0027 marriage broke down.

You won’t see a lot of skin. At least you shouldn’t. It would be seen as disrespectful,’ Meier said. She continued to explain that dresses in black or white should not be worn, as white is for the bride and black is still associated with mourning.While light prints and patterns are welcome at a Spring wedding, big and block patterns are unacceptable but international guests will be permitted to wear their country’s equivalent.          Spain\u0027s Prince Felipe seen here flanked by Princess Letizia and Spain\u0027s Queen Sofia, outside of Westminster Abbey ahead of the wedding between Prince William and Kate MiddletonAccording to etiquette experts Debrett’s, Meghan Markle’s boundary-pushing style will allow for some leeway when it comes to traditional Royal Wedding protocol.It may be unusual to see women wearing trousers at a wedding, but Meghan’s own decision to wear a pantsuit at formal events may mean that covered legs could be welcomed on the big day, especially after jumpsuits were approved at Royal Ascot’s Royal Enclosure.Many invitees may also take a page out of Kate’s book and choose a piece by British labels such as Stella McCartney, Burberry, Emilia Wickstead, Erdem or even Marks and Spencer, as Meghan Markle has in the past.Will Royal Wedding guests be required to wear hats?Women often start with the hat when planning their outfits, as Meier explained and they are kept on during a wedding church service. ‘Hats are a sign of festivity for a British wedding. They are kept on inside the church, but people should be careful of the people sitting behind them. It\u0027s not the Kentucky Derby. No huge brims. Nothing too high.’Princess Beatrice’s hat at Prince William’s wedding was regarded ‘ridiculous in so many ways’ by Royal watcher Anne Chertoff.          Princess Beatrice seen here wearing the Philip Treacy hat she wore at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011When it comes to shoes, open toes, wedges and slingbacks are too informal. Meier said: ‘You want something that is about 4 inches maximum. \u0027The walk in is not going to be easy. There are lots of cobblestones even though there will be different types of carpeting.’In addition to this, handbags should be small as the seating in St. George’s Chapel is very tight, so clutches are recommended.What will men wear to the Royal Wedding?Those who have a military uniform are encouraged to wear it, but most men will opt for a morning suit in either grey, navy or black with coattails. Men will also be expected to wear a waistcoat and a regular tie.For lounge suits, the rule of thumb is the darker it is, the more formal it will look and that rules goes for morning suits too. In the same way, brown shoes are considered less formal than black ones.          Prince William and his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, seen here coming out of Westminster Abbey in London, after their wedding service in 2011What will Meghan Markle wear?Despite the Royal Wedding dress designer being a closely-guarded secret, rumours have suggested that Ralph \u0026amp Russo is the British couturer that has been picked by Meghan Markle. The dress is expected to be a hand-stitched and heavily beaded gown with long sleeves.What will Prince Harry wear?Prince Harry will most likely wear his Household Cavalry British Army uniform and it has been rumoured that he will have to shave his beard because facial hair is frowned upon by the military circle, according to Elle.However, Harry may also go for a morning suit because the wedding is a much more low key affair than that of his brother, Prince William’s. Other rumours suggest that he will wear the Royal Marines ceremonial uniform as a mark of respect to the regiment he took over from Prince Philip.Dancing With The Stars finale: Date, time, finalists and moreThe French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

Her father was a struggling department-store buyer. Wildenstein moved to Paris when she was a teenager.During that time she was in a relationship with the filmmaker Sergio Gobbi. Before her marriage to Alec, she was also linked to Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi and Cyril Piguet.In 1977, at the age of 31, Wildenstein met Alec on a safari trip to Kenya. Alec was there to kill a lion and Wildenstein asked to accompany him. The pair eloped the following year in Las Vegas.It was a tempestuous marriage. The couple reportedly spent $1 million a month on average and went for his-and-hers eye-lifts a year into their marriage. This marked the beginning of a long list of plastic surgeries.‘I would always find out last. She was thinking that she could fix her face like a piece of furniture. Skin does not work that way. But she wouldn’t listen,’ Alec Wildenstein told Vanity Fair.\u0027I don’t think I’ve known her when she wasn’t healing from something,\u0027 said a friend of Jocelyn in 1998. Wildenstein has frequently denied she’s had work done, saying in 1998 that her looks, which led to her being branded ‘Catwoman’, were natural.          In February 2018, the 77-year-old socialite said that she hasn\u0027t had any plastic surgery done‘If I show you pictures of my grandmother,’ she says, ‘what you see is these eyes—cat eyes—and high cheekbones.’ Wildenstein went on to deny she ever had any work done on her nose.After the couple’s children left home, Alec and Wildenstein ended up having ‘constant’ fights.One night, Wildenstein says she walked in on her husband with another woman and alleges he pointed a gun at her and her bodyguards—something Alec disputed, saying Wildenstein was downstairs when he saw the bodyguards.Alec spent the night in jail after the police were called.The pair’s orce was highly public and messy, with Alec slowly cutting Wildenstein’s financial means.Jocelyn Wildenstein before and after plastic surgeryJocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery a year after marrying her husband, in 1978. The pair went in for eye-lifts and the surgery was reportedly the first of many.However, in February 2018, Wildenstein and her now second husband, Lloyd Klein both denied she had any work done.\u0027I don\u0027t understand the whole press and the Catwoman thing because Jocelyn always looked like that,\u0027 Klein told DailyMailTV.Jocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery, an eye-lift, with Alec in 1978\u0027She never really did anything to change her face. I have pictures from 16 years old where she looks exactly the same as today.\u0027 However, in April 2018, Wildenstein admitted to having surgeries but stopping for a time during her orce from Alec.\u0027In the beginning, it\u0027s why I stopped correcting my appearance because the articles were mean and would repeat the image that my ex-husband tried to paint of me,\u0027 she told Paper Magazine. What is Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth?Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth is $16,386,100, according to her Chapter 11 bankruptcy documentation.This is a far cry from the $2.5 billion she was awarded during her orce from Alec Wildenstein. The filing lists that the socialite receives a $900 check a month from Social Security, which it says is her only source of income.Jocelyn Wildenstein bankruptcyJocelyn Wildenstein filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2018, reportedly owing 16 creditors over $6 million. This includes hundreds of thousands of dollars to several building contractors, $70,000 to American Express, over $200,000 to two law firms, and $179,000 to Trump world Tower Condominium.Wildenstein also owes a staggering $4.6 million to Castellan Capital and $700,000 to a New York storage company.Dancing With The Stars finale: Date, time, finalists and moreThe French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

Doria, now 61, was 23 when she married TV lighting director Tom Markle in Sunset Boulevard\u0027s Self-Realization Fellowship Temple two days before Christmas 1979          Doria, meanwhile, despite her early promise, did not go to university but started work selling jewellery, almost certainly to help the family financesSo let us go back in time to when Doria Ragland (she now uses her maiden name) was a little girl.Her mother, Jeanette, grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, the daughter of a bellboy and a lift operator, both of whom worked at the smart, whites-only, five-star St Regis Hotel.Jeanette had been previously married to a professional roller-skater, by whom she had two children — Doria\u0027s half-brother and sister.When he skated out of her life, she was left to bring them up alone. After five years struggling as a single mother, Jeanette fell for snappy-dressing, smooth-talking Alvin Ragland and married again.    Barely had Charles and Diana returned from their honeymoon when, in Los Angeles, Doria was giving birth at West Park hospital in Canoga Park to a baby girlTheir only child, Doria, arrived in 1956 and it was soon after her birth that Alvin uprooted the family and set out to make a new life and better himself across country in California.He had relatives on the West Coast and for a time worked for a real estate business run by his aunt Lillie. Later, by the time Doria was five and he was setting up his modest bric-a-brac and antiques business in central Los Angeles, the marriage was crumbling.At around that time, in Norfolk, England, Diana Spencer was born — not yet Lady Diana, as her father, Viscount (\u0027Johnnie\u0027) Spencer, had not then succeeded to the ancient earldom.Spencer, a former officer in the Royal Scots Greys, had been equerry to both the Queen and her father, George VI, while Diana\u0027s mother, Frances, was the younger daughter of the 4th Baron Fermoy.          Meghan Markle and her mother Doria Ragland leave the Windsor Estate after tea with the Queen           Doria Ragland in the Range Rover which took her from tea with the Queen at Windsor to the hotel this evening          Royal fans took pictures of Harry as he greeted crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening They lived on the Queen\u0027s Sandringham estate in Park House, a lovely Victorian pile that is now a hotel for the disabled. Park House was, in fact, where Frances was born: her late father was a great friend of the King and her mother a confidante of the Queen, later the Queen Mother.The lives of the Spencer family and the royals were entwined and the children played together.Diana was the Spencers\u0027 third daughter but not, alas, the longed for son who would secure continuance of the title. When baby Charles arrived three years after Diana, it was an occasion for a firework display in celebration. As a result, although her mother always denied she was a \u0027disappointment\u0027, Diana carried doubts throughout her life.No such doubts, though, in Los Angeles for Doria, who got on well with her two older half-siblings, Joseph and Saundra, even though it wasn\u0027t long before her father abandoned the family home.Joseph recalls their mother, Jeanette, having to be \u0027both the mother and father of the family, bent on keeping them fed, clothed and together, and succeeding\u0027.Here was a woman whose determination is seen in the family as having been passed down to her daughter, Doria, as well as her actress granddaughter Meghan.For Diana, growing up meant a series of nannies as, by the time she was five, her mother was no longer at home, having fallen for wallpaper heir Peter Shand Kydd.Contrary to popular gossip, her mother wasn\u0027t a so-called \u0027bolter\u0027 but fought in court for custody of her children — only to lose, largely because of the infamous intervention of her own mother Ruth, who sided with her son-in-law.In Los Angeles, Doria\u0027s mother struggled on as a single parent, yet family life in her household was warm and stable.Doria was turning into a bright child who got a prized place at the formerly all-white Fairfax High School in West Hollywood. But in 1971, when she was 15, her education was disrupted by the San Fernando earthquake.The quake destroyed nearby Los Angeles High School, so the two schools had to merge. Doria\u0027s school day was rescheduled to begin at 7am and end at noon.Despite the disruption, she remained one of its brighter pupils, a member of the school\u0027s Apex Club for high achievers.No such academic high-flying for Diana. She was privately educated at boarding schools in Norfolk — and later in Kent — at a time when, even though the Queen Charlotte\u0027s Ball era of debutantes was over, little more was expected of girls from aristocratic families than to find a suitable husband.  Accompanied by his older brother, Harry was met with loud cheers from the crowd as he emerged from the castle wearing a grey jacket, white shirt and slacks          \u0027I just want to go to the pub!\u0027: Harry pointed at the Horse and Groom pub behind adoring fans and photographers in Windsor this evening           Harry and Meghan are pictured among a crowd of well-wishers in the groom\u0027s final public appearance as a single manDiana was not academically strong and left school with no O-levels. But she was far from being \u0027thick as two planks\u0027, as she later self-deprecatingly (and foolishly) described herself.The phrase stuck and was used to denigrate her later during the \u0027War of the Waleses\u0027.Doria, meanwhile, despite her early promise, did not go to university but started work selling jewellery, almost certainly to help the family finances.She also assisted in her father\u0027s store, called \u0027Twas New, and ran a bric-a-brac stall in a Sunday flea market. She even managed to work part-time in a travel agency.At this time, Diana was still at West Heath girls\u0027 school in Kent, excelling at swimming, ballet, tap-dancing and piano. For her, there was no question of having to start work when she left West Heath. Instead, it was finishing school in Rougemont, Switzerland, followed by a cordon bleu cookery course in London.In Los Angeles, Doria was deciding to become a showbusiness make-up artist.As with everything she put her hand to, she did well and found herself training on the set of ABC\u0027s TV drama General Hospital.Also there was the large, cheery figure of Tom Markle, the show\u0027s established lighting director, who was orced with two children.Before long she had moved in with him. But it wasn\u0027t all plain sailing, as his daughter Samantha was far from welcoming. To friends, she cruelly took great pleasure in referring to Doria as \u0027the maid\u0027 on account of her being black.Even in 1979, mixed marriages were not common in the U.S. But despite family uncertainty, Tom and Doria were married. The venue, the Self-Realization temple, was Doria\u0027s choice because she had started to follow the teachings of Yogananda, a Hindu yoga guru.          Harry holds a teddy bear with a red jumper as he and Prince William greet crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening  Prince Harry walks around in front of Windsor Castle as he greeted well-wishers on his last evening of bachelorhoodWithin 11 months, Doria was pregnant with Meghan. It was November 1980.Meanwhile, Diana was living in a flat in Earl\u0027s Court, West London, bought for her by her mother as an 18th birthday present, and sharing it with three other girls. She worked as a nanny and part-time nursery school assistant.In July 1980 she and Prince Charles spent a fateful afternoon together at a barbecue in Petworth, West Sussex. He was the most eligible bachelor on the planet, and within weeks he made it known to friends that he had found the woman he wanted to marry.Exactly a year later, theirs was a typically sumptuous royal wedding, with one sad similarity to today\u0027s event — the frailty of the father of the bride.Earl Spencer had suffered a stroke and almost died. But he was at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral to give his daughter away, though everyone knew she was largely supporting him on their walk up the aisle.And so the parallel lives of Diana and Doria continued.Barely had Charles and Diana returned from their honeymoon when, in Los Angeles, Doria was giving birth at West Park hospital in Canoga Park to a baby girl, whom the happy parents called Rachel Meghan. She was their only child. The date of her birth — August 4, 1981 — was a day the British royals were also celebrating: it was the Queen Mother\u0027s 81st birthday.Tom Markle had decorated baby Meghan\u0027s room with Disney characters and few would have thought then that the marriage would not last. He and Doria seemed happy. But Tom spent a long time at work, sometimes 90 hours a week, and eventually the strain began to tell.Meghan had just had her second birthday in 1983 when her parents split up, although they didn\u0027t orce for another five years.As for Charles and Diana, William had been born in June 1982 and Harry followed in September 1984. But already there were tensions in this royal marriage.Doria and Tom agreed to share custody of Meghan, still spent time with each other and even holidayed together.When Tom worked on a television programme, Doria let Meghan watch it with her, and loved it when their daughter rushed to kiss the screen as her father\u0027s name rolled by on the credits.Work would have been a big problem for Doria but for the help of her mother Jeanette, who stepped in to look after Meghan.As her older step-brother Joseph recalls: \u0027My mother babysat and when Doria finished work, she\u0027d go over to my mother\u0027s house to pick her up.\u0027Small wonder that in later years, after Jeanette suffered a stroke, Meghan would sit with her, talking to her granny, holding her hand and cooking for her. Jeanette died in 2000, aged 71.No such harmony at Kensington Palace. At around the time young Meghan was kissing the TV screen, Diana and Harry were watching a TV programme about Prince Charles which focused on Harry\u0027s father\u0027s affair with Camilla Parker Bowles. When her name was mentioned, Harry asked his mother: \u0027Who\u0027s Camilla?\u0027The split between Harry\u0027s parents when he was eight was the prelude to years of acrimony. When, finally, they were orced in 1996, Diana and Charles also shared custody of their two sons.Harry has subsequently said he doesn\u0027t remember much about it, but friends believe the pain of that time was eclipsed by the death of his mother the following year.In the last months of her life, Diana\u0027s relationship with her own mother also suffered. They were no longer speaking at the time of the Princess\u0027s death.For Diana, the unhappiness in her marriage pulled her towards finding consolation in helping others, from Aids and leprosy victims to those maimed by landmines. She was concerned for people at the margins of society.And in LA, Doria was moving in a similar direction — but hers was a switch in career, from make-up to training as a social worker.These days, she concentrates on the geriatric community, working for Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services in West Los Angeles.Such caring values also dictated Meghan\u0027s upbringing. As a child, Doria wanted to show her there was more to the world than the affluent neighbourhood of Woodland Hills, where they lived. So she took her daughter to see life in the slums of Jamaica and the backstreets of the Mexican city of Oaxaca, where Meghan recalls seeing children playing in dirt roads and hawking chewing gum.Diana took the same approach. As boys, William and Harry accompanied their mother to meet rough-sleepers on the streets of London and the charity staff helping them to survive.As Harry and Meghan say their vows today, who could deny that the linking of this couple from two very different worlds would not be quite so smooth were it not for their mothers."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/22/4C688EEE00000578-5746491-image-a-5_1526677266827.jpg","title":"DOMINIC SANDBROOK 20 years ago wedding inconceivable","story":"    Prince Harry and Meghan Markle seen leaving Kensington Palace the day before their weddingAnd after all the red-top tabloid headlines, all the traumas of his early life, all the girlfriends, the parties and the scandals, Prince Harry — seasoned in service to his country — has found happiness at last.Good for him. He deserves it.This being the Royal Family, of course, things are never straightforward. To Buckingham Palace, the events of the last week must have felt like an unfolding nightmare.Even by the soap opera standards to which the House of Windsor often descends, the chaotic shambles of Meghan’s semi-estranged father Thomas — who planned to walk her down the aisle, apparently staged pictures for a paparazzo, seemingly suffered a heart attack, decided to cry off, changed his mind and then cried off again so Prince Charles is now doing the honours — marks a tragi-comic low point.Still, even the smoothest wedding build-up is rarely free from moments of panic, and there can be few married couples in Britain unfamiliar with the phenomenon of embarrassing in-laws.In any case, the monarchy has long had a melodramatic dimension, in which calamitous weddings have played a particularly eye-catching part. And when compared with past royal nuptials, the excesses of the House of Markle look almost mundane. Although we typically like to think of royal weddings as fairytale occasions, the truth is that many were like something from an unusually horrific nightmare.No pampered public schoolboys or Corbyn crazed snowflakes: The Open University MUST be saved, says DOMINIC SANDBROOK DOMINIC SANDBROOK: We are one of the most prosperous, stable, literate, sophisticated and safest countries on Earth.

But to say our WWII troops were fighting for European values is insulting bunkum, writes DOMINIC SANDBROOK The era of hysteria! Historian DOMINIC SANDBROOK says Britain has become a nation of overgrown toddlers with a bigoted mob mentality, intolerance and a raging sense of grievance at every slight As two films are released about the man who united our nation, where is a Winston Churchill when we need one?Think, for example, of the marriage of Henry VIII and Anne of Cleves in 1540: the king an obese monstrosity with a stinking ulcer on his leg, his German bride a ‘Flanders mare’ who seemed completely out of her depth.Not surprisingly, it was never consummated: rather ungallantly, Henry claimed he had been put off by the ‘hanging of her breasts and looseness of her flesh’.The real soap opera stars, though, were the Hanoverians, who specialised in laughably catastrophic weddings. The marriage of Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1736 is a case in point. Once again the bride was German. At just 16, Augusta of Saxe-Gotha did not speak a word of English and was patently terrified.As she shuffled down the aisle at St James’s Palace she was violently sick, not merely over her own dress, but over her new mother-in-law, Queen Caroline.The most spectacularly disastrous royal wedding of all, though, was that of the future George IV to Caroline of Brunswick in 1795.They first met only three days before the wedding, when George was so disgusted with his bride’s appearance that he immediately called for brandy.At the wedding itself, again at St James’s Palace, George arrived drunk, fell over on the steps of the altar and refused to recite his vows until his father, George III, ordered him to comply.          Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Ragland, arriving at Cliveden House Hotel on the National Trust\u0027s Cliveden Estate to spend the night before her wedding to Prince Harry    A fan of the Royal Family poses in a Union Jack outfit in Windsor ahead of the wedding Although we live in an age of risible hysteria about race and ‘ersity’, especially in the upper echelons of the BBC and in our major universities, most normal people see nothing sensational in the thought of the Queen’s grandson marrying a brown-skinned American. Most of us prefer to judge Ms Markle by her personality, not by her skin pigmentation.Ironically, the monarchy is much more in tune with the instincts of the nation than its chattering-class critics. After all, one in ten British couples now involve people with different ethnicities, while an estimated 833,000 British children are currently being raised by mixed-race couples.In this respect, one family — the Windsors — is the symbol of a bigger story. And that is precisely as it should be.The nation itself, after all, is nothing if it is not an extended family. And the appeal of the Royal Family, when you forget the palaces and pageantry, derives partly from the fact that when we look at them, we see ourselves.Few people embody that more than Harry himself. There cannot be many families who are unfamiliar with the younger son who struggled to find his niche, the party animal who found a serious side or the playboy who grew up.Indeed, one reason that Harry has such wide public appeal is that he is an immediately recognisable figure. Like a modern version of Shakespeare’s Prince Hal — the wayward prince who grew in stature to become Henry V, victor of Agincourt — he has evolved from the days of Nazi fancy-dress party costumes and Las Vegas stripping sessions to serving in Afghanistan and promoting the Invictus Games for injured military veterans.Harry’s is an impressive and inspirational story, not least since he lost his mother in such traumatic circumstances and had to grow up in the glare of the international spotlight.Indeed, I suspect that Harry’s spectacular public approval ratings — one poll recently found that 81 per cent of us have a positive view of him and only 11 per cent have a negative view — reflect the fact that many people still see him as the shell-shocked little boy walking behind his mother’s coffin.No politician could dream of matching such figures. And that, of course, points to another story. In an era when so many other great institutions, from Parliament to the BBC, seem tarnished and beleaguered, the Firm’s sheer resilience, its tenacious grip on our national imagination, remains enormously impressive.Twenty years ago, after the death of Diana, there was a brief burst of apocalyptic talk about the end of the monarchy. But no one is talking about that now. Indeed, when our national destiny seems so uncertain and our public figures inspire such little enthusiasm, the monarchy stands out as the one unchanging fixture, a bulwark of tradition, a beacon of stability in an age of dizzying change.At a time when the world’s most famous republican office is occupied by Donald Trump, the hereditary principle of monarchy looks in pretty robust health to me. After all, the Swedes, the Danes, the Norwegians, the Dutch and the Belgians all have monarchies, and they rank among the safest, richest, most developed and contented societies on earth. Even France’s President Emmanuel Macron — a would-be Napoleon if ever there was one — once remarked that his countrymen are ‘eternally nostalgic’ for their lost kings. ‘The French elect their president to be a monarch,’ he said. ‘Then they want to cut his head off.’In Britain, thankfully, we gave up beheading our kings in 1649. And although other monarchies, from Germany to Russia, have fallen by the wayside, ours remains the supreme symbol of Britishness both at home and abroad.Cynics sometimes like to present us as forelock-tugging lackeys, brainwashed into subservience.But this is nonsense. We know perfectly well that the Royal Family are all too human, with faults and foibles we can all immediately recognise.But the monarchy is the symbol of something bigger, the nation itself — which is why so many metropolitan liberals, the self-styled ‘citizens of nowhere’ who think themselves above the time-honoured loyalties of place and nation, are intellectually incapable of understanding its appeal.Its magic does not lie in the flags and carriages, although they are part of it.The real magic lies in the blend of the national and the inidual, the patriotic and the personal, the past and the present.Of course, the hard-Left can never understand this.Their minds twisted by extremism, their hearts coarsened by envy, they see only privilege where the rest of us see patriotism.Well, let the naysayers stew in their joyless misery. The rest of us, in our tens of millions, would raise a glass to an institution that has served Britain splendidly for centuries, and to two people who deserve a happy future together.For although this is a great national occasion, we should not forget that at its heart are two young people who are not so different, deep down, from thousands of others getting married this summer.So let’s hope today’s happy scenes banish the memories of the last week.And, if you’ll forgive the lèse-majesté, let’s hope the wedding night goes better than it did for Henry VIII. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/06/4C69E2B700000578-5747285-image-a-27_1526707411013.jpg","title":"Several fissures turn active Hawaiis Kilauea volcano lava flies 200ft air","story":"    Fountains of molten lava spurted 200 feet into the air from Hawaii\u0027s Kilauea volcano on Friday           In addition to the massive expulsions of lava, the volcano is also firing out ballistics the size of refrigerators          The Kilauea volcano has been erupting for more than two weeks now, forcing thousands of residents to flee their homes          Those who stay behind are faced with apocalyptic scenes of burning towns and lava streams across the ground          Pictured: An aerial view shows a new fissure eruption sending lava streaming down-slope in huge rivers in Pahoa on FridayPrince Harry and Meghan arrive at Windsor Castle for rehearsalSoldiers leave Victoria Barracks ready for royal wedding rehearsalPetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own landPrince Harry and Meghan ready for wedding rehearsal in WindsorThe Queen is seen driving to Windsor ahead of royal weddingHarry and Meghan arrive in Windsor for royal wedding\u0027s full rehearsal\u0027People will be disappointed\u0027: Robert Lacey on Prince Charles decisionPosh smiles!

It was incredible. Meghan would come into the room and she would light up like a Christmas tree.          Meghan Markle married Prince Harry in an extraordinary ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor on Saturday. Thomas Markle Jr. was not invited \u0027It was a great time because that was the real Meghan. It is the real Meghan. I will never forget it and my father will never forget it. It\u0027s very special,\u0027 he said. He said it was \u0027understandable\u0027 that she threw herself into the role of a lifetime on Suits and, despite previous comments, now doesn\u0027t blame her for it.                              \u0027It\u0027s hard on everybody.

When you jump into Hollywood like that it demands so much of you it pulls you in every different direction, away from your family and away from contact.\u0027And that\u0027s completely understandable - that\u0027s Hollywood. If you ask any actress or actor they\u0027ll do that first before anything.

I don\u0027t think being that it\u0027s her second wedding dress has anything to do with it.\u0027I think this is the one that counts. This is the one that matters,\u0027 he said.  He added that their father, who has had his own share of embarrassment this week after it was revealed he had staged paparazzi photographs and taken money for it, backed out of the wedding at the last minute.           Also not there was the bride\u0027s father Thomas Markle Sr. who embarrassed himself this week by staging paparazzi photographs and taking a sum for it. He suffered a heart attack and said that was the reason he would not attend           Doria Ragland, Meghan\u0027s mother, was the only member of her family who was seen. She beamed with pride throughout her drive to the chapel with her daughter and during the emotional ceremony Thomas Markle Sr. said a recent heart attack, which he suffered days before he was due to walk his daughter down the aisle, kept him from the event.Markle Sr. said his father was happy Prince Charles stood in to accompany Meghan for some of her long walk down St. George\u0027s Chapel. \u0027I think my dad would be sad that he can\u0027t be here but if there was a choice he would be overjoyed Prince Charles is there,\u0027 he said. Markle Jr. added that he was sure Meghan and Harry would be eager to start their own family soon and painted her as a maternal figure who had long doted on his children.           Meghan, 36, is pictured in St George\u0027s Chapel on Saturday during her wedding to Prince Harry. Her half-brother said on Friday that she is \u0027incredible\u0027 \u0027When she was young, dealing with my kids and the way she interacted with them and loved them unconditionally and played with them, it was very obvious she loves children.\u0027She\u0027ll be looking forward to starting her family and that\u0027s a good thing. She\u0027s going to have a great time. \u0027I wish them all the happiness in the world,\u0027 he said.The only member of Meghan\u0027s family who was visibly present at the wedding was her mother, Doria Ragland. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/15/4C6E82FA00000578-5747793-image-m-61_1526738688843.jpg","title":"Kate arrives hand hand Meghans adorable flower girls page boys","story":"Dress your little princess in white like Charlotte in Clare Waight Keller for GivenchyClare Waight Keller for Givenchy couture bridesmaid dressUnavailable to buy - click to browse the current collection by the deisgnerPrincess Charlotte always looks adorable, and her cuteness reached a whole new level in this gorgeous little flower girl dress.

If we don\u0027t act now then the unthinkable could happen. By combining our breeding programme successes with field projects in the wild, we are really making a difference for these magnificent animals.\u0027The project at Chester Zoo has been working with conservationists in India for more than twelve years.They aim to prevent extinction in the wild by utilising the research produced in Chester.         A major project launched by the Zoo,  in Assam, northern India, has successfully eliminated conflict between local communities and the nearby Asian elephant population, offering a blueprint for the future conservation of the species.Scientists at the zoo are also researching a cure for the deadly disease which is threatening Asian elephants.There is currently no cure for elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus, but scientists are hoping to produce a vaccine.           Thi gave birth to a healthy baby boy and keepers at the zoo say both mother and calf, who is yet to be named, are doing very well"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/06/4C69E2B700000578-5747285-image-a-27_1526707411013.jpg","title":"Several fissures turn active Hawaiis Kilauea volcano lava flies 200ft air","story":"    Fountains of molten lava spurted 200 feet into the air from Hawaii\u0027s Kilauea volcano on Friday           In addition to the massive expulsions of lava, the volcano is also firing out ballistics the size of refrigerators          The Kilauea volcano has been erupting for more than two weeks now, forcing thousands of residents to flee their homes          Those who stay behind are faced with apocalyptic scenes of burning towns and lava streams across the ground          Pictured: An aerial view shows a new fissure eruption sending lava streaming down-slope in huge rivers in Pahoa on FridayPrince Harry and Meghan arrive at Windsor Castle for rehearsalSoldiers leave Victoria Barracks ready for royal wedding rehearsalPetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own landPrince Harry and Meghan ready for wedding rehearsal in WindsorThe Queen is seen driving to Windsor ahead of royal weddingHarry and Meghan arrive in Windsor for royal wedding\u0027s full rehearsal\u0027People will be disappointed\u0027: Robert Lacey on Prince Charles decisionPosh smiles!

She and six other activists have been arrestedThe activists had persistently called for the right for women to drive, with the ban to be lifted in just six weeks.However, they stressed that this was only the first step toward full rights and for year also called for an end to less visible forms of discrimination.They campaigned for lifting guardianship laws that give male relatives final say on whether a woman can travel abroad, obtain a passport, or marry.Their movement was seen as part of a larger democratic and civil rights push in the kingdom, which remains an absolute monarchy where protests are illegal.All major decision-making rests with the king and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Some state-linked media outlets published the names of those detained, which include Loujain al-Hathloul, Aziza al-Yousef and Eman al-Najfan.          Pro-government media outlets splashed their photos online and in newspapers, accusing them of betrayal for their supposed crimesRights activists said Madeha al-Ajroush and Aisha al-Manae are also among the seven detained. Both took part in the first women\u0027s protest movement for the right to drive in 1990, in which 50 women were arrested for driving and lost their passports and their jobs.All five women are well-known activists who agitated for greater women\u0027s rights. Several of the women were professors at state-run universities and are mothers or grandmothers.The Interior Ministry on Saturday did not name those arrested, but said the group is being investigated for communicating with \u0027foreign entities\u0027. It said they were working to recruit people in sensitive government positions and giving money to foreign circles aiming to destabilise and harm the kingdom.The stunning arrests come just six weeks before Saudi Arabia is set to lift the world\u0027s only ban on women driving next month.Saudi police save three women from rapists - then arrest...Millions of Muslims around the world prepare for...Share this articleWhen the kingdom issued its royal decree last year announcing that women would be allowed to drive in 2018, women\u0027s rights activists were contacted by the royal court and warned against giving interviews to the media or speaking out on social media.Following the warnings, some women left the country for a period of time and others stopped voicing their opinions on Twitter.As activists were pressured into silence, Saudi Arabia\u0027s 32-year-old heir to the throne stepped forth, positioning himself as the force behind the kingdom\u0027s reforms.However, Human Rights Watch said the crown prince\u0027s so-called reform campaign \u0027has been a frenzy of fear for genuine Saudi reformers who dare to advocate publicly for human rights or women\u0027s empowerment\u0027.\u0027The message is clear that anyone expressing skepticism about the crown prince\u0027s rights agenda faces time in jail,\u0027 Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said  Loujain al-Hathloul was another of the seven activists branded \u0027traitors\u0027 who were working for \u0027foreign entities\u0027Last year, Prince Mohammed oversaw the arrests of dozens of writers, intellectuals and moderate clerics who were perceived as critics of his foreign policies. He also led an unprecedented shakedown of top princes and businessmen, forcing them to hand over significant portions of their wealth in exchange for their freedom as part of a purported anti-corruption campaign.In an interview with CBS in March, he said that he was \u0027absolutely\u0027 sending a message through these arrests that there was a new sheriff in town.Activists said writer Mohammed al-Rabea and lawyer Ibrahim al-Mudaimigh, two men who worked to support women\u0027s rights campaigners, are also among the seven detained. Al-Mudaimigh defended al-Hathloul in court when she was arrested in late 2014 for more than 70 days for her online criticism of the government and for attempting to bring attention to the driving ban by driving from neighboring United Arab Emirates into Saudi Arabia.Those familiar with the arrests said al-Hathloul was forcibly taken by security forces earlier this year from the UAE, where she was residing, and forced back to the kingdom.In recent weeks, activists said several women\u0027s rights campaigners were also banned from traveling abroad.  Their movement was seen as part of a larger democratic and civil rights push in the kingdom, which remains an absolute monarchy where protests are illegal and major decision-making rests with the king and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (pictured)Immediately after news of the arrests broke, pro-government Twitter accounts were branding the group as treasonous under an Arabic hashtag describing them as traitors for foreign embassies.The pro-government SaudiNews50 Twitter account, with its 11.5 million followers, splashed images of those arrested with red stamps over their face that read \u0027traitor\u0027 and saying that \u0027history spits in the face of the country\u0027s traitors.\u0027The state-linked Al-Jazirah newspaper published on its front-page a photo of al-Hathloul and al-Yousef under a headline describing them as citizens who betrayed the nation.Activists said some in the group were arrested on Tuesday and at least one person was arrested Thursday.They said the detainees were transferred from the capital, Riyadh, to the city of Jiddah for interrogations where the royal court has relocated for the month of Ramadan.Activists said it wasn\u0027t not clear why the seven were arrested now."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/15/4C6DE95B00000578-5747477-image-m-49_1526738873891.jpg","title":"En route Prince Harry leaves Coworth Park hotel royal Wedding","story":"    Meghan Markle launched her own mini-revolution as she married Prince Harry today in a relaxed and multi-cultural wedding Harry\u0027s relatives will never seen before  Meghan and Harry\u0027s kiss sparked huge cheers from people outside the chapel and the 100,000 watching on the streets of Windsor          A sea of smiling faces greets Harry and Meghan as they leave the church after the American-influenced service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury          Meghan and Harry process out of the chapel after exchanging vows in a quite extraordinary wedding today   Harry looked delighted as he walked his new wife out of St George\u0027s Chapel to start their new life together      Be a beautiful bride like Meghan in Clare Waight Keller for GivenchyClare Waight Keller for Givenchy Haute CoutureHead to the Givenchy website herePrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s big day is finally here and we haven\u0026#39t been this excited for a dress since the Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s wedding back in 2011.

I’ve been through phases of dressing like a goth, a hippy and a really girly girl. As a student, I read economics and philosophy, then worked for a PR company where everyone dressed in suits. Then, after reading an article that said you should follow your passion according to which part of the newspaper you read first, I pivoted into a career in food with an apprenticeship at Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen restaurant. I’ve worked hot shifts in busy kitchens, and now I spend my time testing recipes, going on food photoshoots and writing about cooking, alongside looking after my two-year-old son at home. But through it all, I’ve kept a very consistent look. I’ve always admired women who reinvent themselves dramatically, but that’s just never been my way. Happily, I’ve always been content in my own skin and I put that down to my mum.Looking back on myself as a little girl, I was so pretty and sweet but I didn’t always feel it. I wore glasses, which I hated, so I ditched them for contact lenses as soon as I could. However, at quite a young age I realised that despite what I looked like, my value came from my inside not my outside. That discovery was thanks to Mum. She really instilled in my sister, Laura, and me that makeup was there for us to use if we wanted it, but that it wasn’t something we should put on for anyone beyond ourselves. As a teenager I would play around with pink pearlescent lipsticks and questionable eyeshadows and it was always a fun part of dressing up – it never felt essential. As a proud feminist, Mum has only ever dressed for herself, and is naturally very beautiful. She has the most vibrant, glowing skin and has never worn a scrap of foundation. I carry her belief inside me, which is that I’m worth more than what I put on my face.Following my apprenticeship, I worked in restaurant kitchens in London and around the world. I’d swapped the corporate world of heels and power suits for a predominantly male environment. I’d still wear makeup in the kitchen but not too much – opening an oven door, for instance, can melt off your mascara. I’d wear chef’s whites, made for men, with my hair scraped back. The chef’s outfit was defeminising and sometimes that was useful, especially on the occasions where I’d have to bring out my inner alpha female. But I also wanted to feel like a woman – and to feel like myself – and a little makeup helped me mark myself out from the boys, even if it was just a lick of mascara, some blusher and a dot of concealer.When I left the kitchens to work for Jamie Oliver on his food team, helping him to write recipes, make his TV shows and make his food look good in pictures, I was introduced to a whole new world of photoshoots, lights and cameras.And, thanks to my work, I’ve had my eyes opened to the fact that there’s more than just one makeup setting – it doesn’t have to always be a natural base and a flick of eyeliner.This was brought home to me in the run up to my wedding, two years ago. John and I married in a beautiful church on an island in north Wales. It was an idyllic setting but I wasn’t sure I’d be able to get a makeup artist to take the trip, so my dear friend Ceri bought me a three-hour makeup lesson in London with an amazing woman called Sasha, so that I could do my own on the day. It was fantastic and so much better than watching a YouTube tutorial. Obviously I don’t often recreate the look I wore on my wedding day (although it was very natural), but thanks to that lesson, I have a few different “faces” that I can bring out, depending on the occasion. And while I’m often happy to embrace the day bare-faced, I do have a go-to look that suits me most days. Having never been a morning person – and now with my son Dylan, two, to look after – I can do the whole thing in seven minutes: light foundation, cream concealer, bronzer, peachy blusher, eyelash curlers, mascara and a smear of lip balm. I’ve done it on the tube and in the back of a taxi.There’s a definite synergy that connects the way I look and the ethos behind my style of cooking. My recipes are full of fresh, vibrant, earthy flavours and that’s reflected in how I present myself. I like clothes made from natural fabrics that feel good on my skin in colours that reflect nature – my love of things that come from the earth pervades every aspect of my life. With the food I make, I try to put joy at the centre of every plate, and that’s how I approach getting ready in the morning. Those seven minutes are probably the only time I spend on myself during the whole day. It’s a ritual that helps me to feel bright and ready to face the day.Photography: Brian Daly and Louisa Parry"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d296d2c2e4b7861b1b71142c0514c65b787e536/0_265_5007_3006/master/5007.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44a177647e97ed3fba38ce7508d70f1d","title":"chris grayling east coast mainline nationalisation","story":"Struggling to supply a lick of bright paint to his plans for the east coast mainline, Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, settled on the word “iconic”. He told the Commons on Wednesday that the new, publicly owned operator scheduled to replace the failed Virgin-Stagecoach combine next month will be called the LNER. “One of Britain’s iconic rail brands … the London North Eastern Railway,” he said, getting it half right as usual: the original title had a conjunction – it was the London and North Eastern Railway – which gives a truer idea of its scope. Without the conjunction, it might be a suburban transport network that reaches no further than Enfield. With it, you have a notion of the 500-mile line that connects London King’s Cross to the great cathedrals of York and Durham, and skirts the North Sea all the way from Alnmouth to Aberdeen.Does pedantry always come with a liking for railways? Perhaps it does. (I often wonder at my own irritation. In the film Dunkirk, for example, the evacuees from the beaches come ashore in England to entrain in a carriage that obviously dates from the 1950s. Why oh why? ) But if railway enthusiasm can mean pedantry, and pedantry can mean truthfulness, then we might conclude that Grayling spent very little of his youth on the station platforms of Buckinghamshire, where he grew up. He was born in 1962, after all, which means that by the time he went to school in High Wycombe trainspotting was close to vanishing as a mainstream pastime for adolescent boys. He may have been aware that the railway that ran through his town was one of Britain’s last main lines, built jointly by the Great Western and Great Central to connect London more directly with the Midlands and the north he may also have known that, after the railway amalgamations of 1923, the LNER itself sent trains rushing through the Chiltern Hills. But a man who uses the phrase “iconic rail brands” does not seem likely to have been such a boy.I saw what I think of as my first LNER engine in December 1948. I know the year and the month because we were on our way from Lancashire to my grandparents’ golden wedding in Fife, and snow lay thick in the cuttings as our train climbed to the summits at Shap and Beattock. The railways had been nationalised in January that year, and, so far as I knew, as a child born into old London, Midland and Scottish territory, all engines were shabby and black. Then, at Carlisle, my brother pointed out a green engine – “apple-green” was the LNER’s description – that had probably travelled across England at the head of a train from Newcastle. I never saw one so unforgettably green again – it must have been one of the very last to have been painted in LNER colours – though a duller green was eventually adopted as the livery for the express classes on British Railways after an experimental year or two in a rich dark blue.When we moved north a few years later, to a house at the end of the Forth bridge, we found ourselves firmly in the LNER’s old domain. “Iconic” wasn’t then a word in regular use, but it would be true to say that the company had established a reputation for speed and modernity, which it owed to real achievement as well as a gifted publicity department. It was an LNER engine, the Mallard, that held the world speed record for steam traction (126mph near Grantham, 3 July 1938), and 15 years later locomotives of the same streamlined class regularly passed the bottom of our street, with names such as Empire of India, Commonwealth of Australia, Kingfisher and Merlin. Wedge-shaped fronts improved their aerodynamics and lifted smoke clear of the driver’s line of sight, while their distinctive chime whistles made us aware of their coming when still miles away. No other British steam engines took trains so frequently to speeds above 100mph, including the Flying Scotsman but then no other railway had a flatter or straighter mainline.Many children of my generation also witnessed the past in another way. From the late 1940s, writers such as John Betjeman, C Hamilton Ellis and OS Nock published essays and books that implied the golden age of British railways had died with the first world war. They would take a fragment of memory (like mine of the green engine at Carlisle) and from it construct what almost amounted to a worldview: Things Were Better Before. When this nostalgia was combined with an English distaste for state ownership, fostered by publications as disparate as Orwell’s 1984 and the , it left the nationalised railway with few friends and it was no wonder that when John Major talked of railway privatisation he summoned visions of the marvellous old Great Western and its coaches in their livery of chocolate and cream.The company that won the first franchise on the east coast mainline also reflected this affection – in its name, the Great North Eastern Railway, and also in the Victorian coat of arms that embellished the side of its trains, and the handsome blue-and-white crockery in its restaurant cars. None of this old-fashioned elegance, however, could alter the fact that it had overbid for its franchise – which also proved the case with its unloved successor, National Express, so that the service was taken into public ownership in 2009 and held there until the latest over-bidders, Virgin and Stagecoach, came along in 2015.Despite this unhappy record, Grayling is determined that the franchise will be delivered into private hands once again in 2020, this time as part of an experimental partnership with the owners of the track, the public institution Network Rail. The details are so far unspecified. All we know is that we have a brand, LNER, that floats disconnected from any historical reality. At least, unlike its immediate predecessors, it sounds neither like a soap powder nor a bourbon. For this small dignity we should be grateful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e6dfca7dc97294668095c332db03ed678dd55f0/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a86982d0ac7b1f0a4511def756dc001e","title":"harry meghan republican royal wedding","story":"The royal wedding, as we now know it, was born in 1922. The marriage of Princess Mary to Viscount Lascelles was, it is said, less an arranged union than a forced one. Lascelles bet his friends that if he asked King George V’s only daughter to marry him she’d say yes. Mary was not keen. But the king insisted. Whatever private anxiety there might have been was buried deep beneath the public ceremony.Monarchies elsewhere had fallen foul of popular uprisings Britain’s royals felt they had to work for their privileges. Five years earlier, during the first world war, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha had rebranded itself the House of Windsor to establish some distance from their German lineage.Mary’s wedding was another opportunity to connect with the public. For the first time in a long time a royal wedding was held at Westminster Abbey, with a full procession and coverage by Pathé News. “It is now no longer Mary’s wedding,” wrote her brother, the future George VI. “But (this from the papers) it is the ‘Abbey Wedding’ or the ‘Royal Wedding’ or the ‘National Wedding’ or even the ‘People’s Wedding’.”Royal weddings are no more about two people being in love than a presidential inauguration is about a politician’s first day in a new job. That doesn’t mean the couple in question don’t necessarily love each other. Only that it is not a prerequisite for the ceremony.When it comes to royal events it is not iniduals but the institution – the monarchy – that really counts. So the nuptials of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are a private ceremony only in the formal sense that it is not an official state occasion. It will be televised, has received acres of newspaper coverage, has 600 guests, costs £32m, and 1,200 “commoners” have been nominated to “join in”.I wish it was private. Then they could have their seclusion and I could ignore it. But then what would the point of that be? “To be invisible,” wrote the 19th-century constitutionalist Walter Bagehot, “is to be forgotten … To be a symbol, and an effective symbol, you must be vividly and often seen.”I for one have already seen enough. I’m a republican for all the obvious reasons. A monarchy establishes inherited privilege at the heart of government and embeds patronage at the centre of power. The royals are a class act. And that’s the problem. I’m not a very passionate republican – many things bother me more than the monarchy. But as principles go it is unwavering. We have a class problem in Britain and the monarchy exemplifies it. If it’s a guilty pleasure I’m after, I don’t turn to betrothals in real-world feudal dynasties: I have Netflix. The political scientist Benedict Anderson described countries as imagined communities. Call me a misery guts, but I’d rather imagine one in which I am born a citizen, not a subject, and others are not born to govern me.I’d be fine leaving the whole thing alone the trouble is it won’t leave me alone. Last week Harry and Meghan showed up in both my kids’ book bags – they’d been invited by their schools to celebrate their wedding by wearing red, white and blue or buying cupcakes or both.This is propaganda through tasty pastry. The purpose of these highly scripted and tightly choreographed weddings is twofold: to renew the monarchy’s sense of legitimacy and to establish its relevance. Those who claim God has ordained that they should rule over everyone else will always have to worry about credibility. The Russian tsar executed by the Bolsheviks was the Queen’s grandfather’s cousin. Her husband, Prince Phillip, was evacuated from Greece as a baby on a warship in a cot made from a fruit box. So she knows a thing or two about what can happen when legitimacy is lost.It is worth noting that the wedding in which the most royal PR capital has been invested – between Prince Charles and Lady Diana – was for the marriage that failed most publicly and calamitously. The uncertain response to Diana’s death was the one occasion in recent memory the institution looked vulnerable. For all that, the monarchy seems safe. Half of Britons think it is good for Britain and even more believe it should continue.Given the parlous state of our political class, the polarised nature of our political culture and the absurd figure we cut on the world stage following the Brexit vote, institutions such as the monarchy can be reassuring for some. A royal wedding provides a semblance of stability and the hope of unity for those who’d favour the certainties of a benign dictatorship over the vagaries of democracy.The royals’ relevance relates to their ability to adapt their elite entitlements to the popular mood. The Queen, for example, used clothing ration coupons to pay for her wedding dress (the government gave her £200 extra). Meanwhile both the Duchess of Cambridge and Markle have university degrees, the first royal brides who can claim such erudition. Being black, Markle is the first who can claim such melanin. These attributes, we’re told, illustrate the institution’s capacity to evolve. If anything they reveal the opposite. Women with university degrees and interracial marriages are neither recent nor rare in Britain. The fact they are remarkable at this level of the aristocracy is itself remarkable.But the weddings I enjoy are the ones where I know the people getting married. I have no more inclination to be interested in this wedding than to wander into a random church on a Saturday afternoon and become engrossed in the ceremony of anyone else I don’t know. I don’t begrudge anyone feeling differently. I understand that all sorts of people see all sorts of things in her, him, them and it. And I get the intrigue over Charles’s late entry as the candidate to walk Markle down the aisle. “A princely marriage is the brilliant edition of a universal fact, and, as such, it rivets mankind,” wrote Bagehot. “A royal family sweetens politics by the seasonable addition of nice and pretty events.”Once upon a time maybe. But at this stage the appeal for many seems to lie in a cross between Red Nose Day and the Eurovision song contest – a camp and kitschy licence to be lowbrow on a national scale. If they can derive pleasure from the elite marriage of strangers, that’s great. I bear no animus towards the happy couple on their big day.I am a republican and a humanist.

He has some urgent questions relating to a missing girl, the subliminal messages on his records, and some parrot-related mystery the exact details of which I’ve already forgotten. “But what does it all mean?” he wails at one point, and the line sends ripples of laughter through the cinema.Ostensibly the audience is laughing at Under the Silver Lake (David Robert Mitchell’s follow-up to his excellent It Follows), which finally doesn’t amount to a hill of beans. But they’re also giggling at themselves and at the great, pressing question suddenly bellowed down from the screen. What does it all mean? Cannes grows weird during these dying days. The films turn confusing and the punters start flagging, and the boundaries between art and life have a tendency to break down. Every other old man on the street looks like Francis Ford Coppola, and the soldiers with assault rifles might possibly be actors in a publicity stunt. The programme is no help it keeps messing with our heads. In one 36-hour spell it lays on screenings of a film called The Angel, a film called Angel Face and a third called Sorry Angel. If we catch the wrong one, will we even notice?What a curious, fascinating festival this has been – a stumbling first step on the road to redemption – away from the old guard, belatedly into the new century. Gallons of fresh blood have been poured into competition, while the organisers are at least recognising that they need more women in the lineup. So the direction of travel has largely been decided. It remains to be seen how far and how fast we can move.What does it all mean? Don’t ask Jean-Luc Godard, the chain-rattling ghost from Cannes days gone by. Appearing at a press conference via FaceTime, he was asked about his decision to include a clip from Michael Bay’s 13 Hours inside The Image Book, his predictably perplexing latest film. Godard, it seemed, was at a loss. Not only was he unaware of the clip’s inclusion, he claimed to have never even heard of Michael Bay.What does it all mean? Surely the films have the answer, although some of this year’s crop were found wanting. Hopes were high for Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman (about an African American cop who joins the KKK), but it’s an underpowered, complacent affair that only explodes into life with its closing footage from 2017’s Charlottesville protests. Elsewhere, Ash Is Purest White was a gorgeous state-of-modern-China romance with too much fat on its bones, while Eva Husson’s Girls of the Sun (about a female Kurdish combat unit) split the audience down the middle. Personally, I found it heavy-handed and cheesy. The fact that a woman can make a big, crude, Hollywood-style war movie might be progress of sorts, but Kathryn Bigelow has trodden similar terrain to better effect and, anyway, it isn’t in and of itself radical.What does it all mean? Never ask Lars von Trier the man can’t be trusted. Ejected from Cannes back in 2011, the one-time enfant terrible returned to serve the festival with its one bona fide shock film. The House That Jack Built stars Matt Dillon as a clench-jawed psychopath (and would-be architect) who claims to have murdered upwards of 60 people. Its gleeful bloody violence provoked mass walkouts. Those who remained found themselves dragged through hell. “Jesus Christ!” yelled the man in the seat behind mine. But not even the messiah could save us from Lars.There were no British titles in competition and so we clambered upstairs to catch sight of Whitney, Kevin Macdonald’s devastating portrait of the pop superstar, apparently beloved by Nelson Mandela and Saddam Hussein alike. Watching Whitney Houston’s decline was like witnessing a slow-motion car crash. The driver swings heedlessly into traffic and is hit again and again until everything’s been knocked loose and scattered. Except that Macdonald brilliantly manages to trace the root of Houston’s problems to her Baptist childhood, uncovering a long-buried tale of familial abuse. One comes away with the sense that the woman might have been doomed from the outset.Outside the Palais is where Cannes almost meets the real world. The red carpet hosts a protest by 82 women calling for more female representation in film another by 16 BME actors highlighting institutionalised racism within the French film industry. Yet both protests play out behind steel cordons, with the crowds kept at a distance. Security has been tightened and tension runs high. Not long ago this place was a free-for-all. There were street vendors and rookie film-makers screening their product inside a van. Representatives from the Troma movie studio would march past, invariably dressed up as zombies and screaming into loudhailers. These days the main drag is largely out of bounds, given over to police bikes and sleek black limousines. The new, improved Cannes would benefit from some zombies.Best in show at this year’s festival? Happily there are a number of titles to choose between and the closing stretch saw the arrival of some tardy instant classics. Keep an eye out for The Wild Pear Tree, a windblown bildungsroman from the Turkish film-maker Nuri Bilge Ceylan, in which an arrogant graduate shuttles between a series of mentors and muses, and Lee Chang-dong’s Burning, which spins a Murakami short story into a simmering thriller spotlighting South Korea’s underclass. I also adored Shoplifters, which follows the fortunes of a makeshift family of rogues before bowing out with a heartpiercing finale. Few directors seed their stories with as much subtlety and grace as Japan’s Hirokazu Kore-eda. His films initially look rather bare and spindly, only to burst into flower like late cherry blossoms.Other pictures screen early and then cling to you for days. It’s now a week since I caught Cold War and I still can’t shake it off. Paweł Pawlikowski’s postwar love story is strung between the eastern bloc and the west, hotwired to the sounds of Polish folk music and seductive American jazz. Cold War isn’t cold it’s positively burning with passion and its lead player, Joanna Kulig, is a star in the making.And then there’s Happy As Lazzaro, Alice Rohrwacher’s time-bending rustic fable roughage for the soul that comes sugared with magic realism. This plays out in a crumbling village mired in a semi-rural past before a sudden reveal pulls the stage-flats away and sends us off in a completely different direction. It might not be the greatest film in the lineup, but its rich humanism seems to speak to the moment – the right film for right now. Maybe that’s enough.In the middle of the week the Cannes heavens open. There are violent cloudbursts across town and forked lightning out over the Med. Then, when the rain has abated, comes more rolling thunder as wheelie-cases are dragged down through town to the bus-stop. One by one, the festival’s guests have begun packing up and shipping out. In the dog days of this festival, there is no sound more melancholic than the rumble of plastic wheels on tarmac. It means that the circus is closing and it’s time to go home.Cannes controversyGaspar Noé played up the coast with his nightmarish Climax and won the best reviews of his career. Lars von Trier played inside the Palais with The House That Jack Built and came away with his worst. Lars wins by a mile.Hollywood hits and missesRamin Bahrani’s Fahrenheit 451 proved idiotic and heavy Ron Howard’s Star Wars prequel, Solo (below), was light, noisy and zippy. So we’re voting with the Wookie.Inappropriate musical cuesBad enough that a gathering of 82 female protesters on the Palais steps is accompanied by Roy Orbison’s Pretty Woman. Still worse when fearsome Cate Blanchett is ushered on to the strains of Just Like a Woman... “but she breaks just like a little girl”. Yeah, right she does.Films in the marketWe’re obviously intrigued by A Dysfunctional Cat and Help, I Shrunk My Parents. But our Marche Palme d’Or goes to the gloriously titled Snake Outta Compton.Quote of the festival“Keep away from the pool, the fucking pump’s gone insane!”: yelled from the garden at Lars von Trier’s rented villa on the far edge of Cannes.

Then the setbacks began. First, City lost an FA Cup semi-final to Emma Hayes’s Chelsea and then Lyon knocked them out at the same stage of the Champions League, before Hayes’s team clinched the Women’s Super League title.Now one final, potentially crushing, disappointment must be avoided. With a renascent Arsenal only one point behind City going into Sunday afternoon’s final round of WSL fixtures, they dare not stumble at home to Everton. A slip could permit Joe Montemurro’s players, who travel to Bristol City, to leapfrog into second place and snatch the ision’s last Champions League slot.In March Arsenal beat Cushing’s side in the Continental Cup final, ensuring there would be no repeat of the domestic double secured in 2016, the last full campaign before the game’s switch from a summer to a winter schedule.“It’s been a disappointing season,” concedes City’s England forward Nikita Parris. “But we’re still so close to qualifying for the Champions League. We’ve got a lot of young, developing players so we’re in a good place. Qualifying is massive. We’re determined to do it. It’s what this club needs.”A team apparently running on empty also look in need of a good rest before they face Paris Saint-Germain, North Carolina Courage and Chelsea at the inaugural International Champions Cup in Miami in late July. A training camp in Oregon follows but, for several of Cushing’s players, the American trip comes tightly sandwiched between World Cup qualifiers with England involving away dates in Russia in June and Wales in August.The presence of so many key components of Phil Neville’s squad in their ranks is both a blessing and a curse for City. Tellingly 10 of the starting XI Cushing deployed for the goalless Champions League semi-final first leg against Lyon had been called up by Neville this year, with the Lionesses’ participation in March’s SheBelieves Cup in the United States proving exhausting.For a time before Neville’s appointment City feared losing Cushing to England but the 33-year-old eventually withdrew from the FA’s shortlist, signing a new club contract. Off-pitch turmoil was averted but on it the absence of City’s captain, the centre-half Steph Houghton, with an ankle injury contributed to some vital points being dropped during February.By then the departures last summer of the outstanding England right-back Lucy Bronze to Lyon and the forward Toni Duggan to Barcelona were really being felt. Perhaps inevitably an expertly volleyed goal from Bronze gave Lyon a 1-0 aggregate Champions League win against her old club – the French champions face Wolfsburg in Kiev on Thursday.With City’s new Denmark striker Nadia Nadim struggling, Chelsea have proved the infinitely better-balanced unit. Significantly, the shortlist for the PFA female player of the year comprised five Chelsea stars and City’s Jill Scott. The award was deservedly won by Fran Kirby the Chelsea forward blessed with a rare ability to play between the lines has barely stopped scoring this season.Hayes, who gave birth to a healthy baby boy on Thursday when Chelsea announced that the other twin she was expecting had sadly “failed to make it”, is undoubtedly an exceptional coach but Kirby’s catalytic presence remains the overwhelming reason for the six-point gap separating the top two.This gulf will not have gone down well with City’s Abu Dhabi-based ownership. Ditto the disappointing average attendances of around 1,500 at the women’s 7,000-capacity Academy Stadium. But next season offers a prospective new dawn and, in Keira Walsh, Mel Lawley and Georgia Stanway, Cushing has three of England’s brightest emerging talents.In 12 months that trio could well be preparing for the 2019 World Cup in France having helped City reclaim the game’s glittering prizes. First though a Champions League place needs guaranteeing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfa0ff616079c36b81f2251428ac735e9f9e70b0/0_0_6252_3751/master/6252.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e569729519a53180fc5090d4c054dfc","title":"per mertesacker book extract arsenal academy manager","story":"In an exclusive extract from his new book, the former defender explains what he learned during his career and how footballers must do more to condition their bodiesMy experience has taught me that you simply cannot do enough. For example, I was a big fan of yoga from the beginning because I had seen that it improved stability and flexibility.Even at the age of 33 I was one of the most flexible at Arsenal when it came to my back muscles. Hardly anyone came to the yoga sessions that the club offered. Often there were only four of us: Héctor Bellerín, Nacho Monreal and Tomas Rosicky.The youth players who were promoted to the first team smiled at these exercises. They thought we were meditating. They were happy with the ball at their feet but for everything else there was a lack of desire. “I play football and go to training. That’s enough.”But no, it isn’t enough when you want to maintain a certain level for a long time or want to improve.Either you are learning from scratch, from your parents and the teachers and coaches around you, to take responsibility, or you don’t do it at all. This is the kind of dumbing down we must fight against.In the autumn of 2017 an under-18 player came and asked whether we could sit down for a chat. I nearly fell over, I was so surprised. That hadn’t happened in the six and a half years I had been there. He wanted to speak to me about leadership.I used a lot of energy trying to convince team-mates they should do more for their bodies and try new things. But working long term to improve their weaknesses? Hardly anyone.Working with him was a huge success. We always assume that we can run and see properly because nothing hurts. But that is a mistake. Lars showed me that our eyes are a big factor in everything, above all when it comes to our timing.And as my left eye was not really looking at the ball I was always twisting my neck to use my dominant right eye.Football doesn’t really deal with those things, despite the fact they can be decisive. Players would rather lift weights, stand on their own with their dumbbells – but how does that help me on the pitch?During the exercises with Lars one could see quite clearly that my eyes were moving differently when an object was approaching me. My left eye always remained in the middle rather than focusing on the object.He showed me how to make my left eye stronger. I had a patch on my right eye, forcing my left eye to focus on the objects. And after a few weeks I could really notice the difference in games. If there was a high ball from the left I had a much better feeling for where it would end up.With Lars’s help I stayed injury-free for four and a half years. Meeting him changed my life as a footballer.The important thing was to do exercises myself before games as well to adjust the eyes. One example was a kind of push-up for the eyes. You bring a pencil in towards your nose and force your eyes towards the middle. When you do that at the training ground a lot of people think: “What is he doing now? Is he completely stupid?”Mainly I was doing it at home or in the hotel room. I had six or seven exercises that I did, sometimes just before kick-off in the dressing room. I didn’t care what the others thought or if they laughed. But you saw again that something new, something unknown, led to laughter rather than people asking: “What are you doing there?”Footballers are used to working only three hours a day. And out of the three hours they are at the training ground they are on their mobiles for half of that.We have all the money in the world but do not realise how important the body is. A player on average has a seven‑year professional career, 10-15 if everything goes right. You have to do everything possible to be at your maximum.A lot of players don’t even know what maximum is – for them it is about having fun on the pitch. But there is more to being a professional than that.In my new role as Arsenal academy manager I will do everything I can to challenge the young players’ mindsets. I want to challenge them so that they are ready to take on new ideas and protect them from being injured, when it comes to their body and soul.I want to convince them they have to do something to get to the top of the world and I want to be an example for them. For me there wasn’t really a way up but somehow I made it there anyway, because I did everything I possibly could to give me the best chances to succeed.

Four years after the photograph was taken, it was further seared on the collective football consciousness when the author and journalist Simon Kuper used it to illustrate the cover of his award-winning bestseller Football Against The Enemy. Kuper would later regret doing so and apologised to one of the players featured in the photograph on the grounds that it was probably unfair to highlight such an unseemly act when it had been perpetrated by somebody for whom such behaviour was so utterly out of character.The snap in question? Rudi Völler standing in thoughtful meditation with his hands on his hips in the immediate aftermath of one of the most unjust dismissals in World Cup history, while over his right shoulder, his Dutch rival Frank Rijkaard looks to be inspecting the massive grolly he had just violently expectorated and left dangling from the back of the German striker’s bubble perm like a Christmas tree bauble.“If I spit they will take my spit and frame it as great art,” Pablo Picasso once said. Rijkaard’s flob into Völler’s head may have been a masterpiece of a fairly unpleasant genre but was never heralded as great art. It did, however, contrive to make global headlines, earning the defender the nickname “Llama” in honour of the South American camelid’s prodigious ability for hurling projectiles manufactured from saliva. It was an uncharacteristically vile act performed by a man almost universally held in the highest of regard and one for which he later apologised. Völler accepted Rijkaard’s mea culpa and the incident was later put to bed when the pair agreed to break bread – and spread butter – together for a TV commercial, with both their fees going to charity.The rivalry between Holland and West Germany, as they were then known, was and remains notoriously fierce. Its roots are in the second world war and the mutual loathing of both teams and sets of fans intensified after “The Mother of all Defeats”, when the Germans famously triumphed over the Dutch in the 1974 World Cup final.At the 1980 European Championships, the German goalkeeper Toni Schumacher was assaulted by the Dutchman Huub Stevens in another German victory, while the Dutch exacted some measure of revenge eight years later, when Marco van Basten sent Holland through to the final at Germany’s expense on a night when his team-mate Ronald Koeman enraged German sensibilities by pretending to wipe his backside with Olaf Thon’s shirt. The following year they were further incited during a qualifier for Italia 90 in Rotterdam, when Dutch fans unfurled a giant banner comparing the German captain, Lothar Matthäus, to Adolf Hitler. One did not need to be a rune-reader to predict their meeting in the second round of Italia 90 was likely to be spicy.Like most matches between West Germany and the Netherlands it was a bad-tempered affair. Having topped Group D ahead of Yugoslavia and Colombia in second and third place, Völler and his team-mates, who would go on to win the match and the tournament, had earned a berth in a decidedly tricky second-round eliminator against their old foes in Milan’s San Siro. The format of Italia 90 meant the top two teams in each of the six groups progressed to the second round, where they were joined by the four best third-placed teams from the group stages. With Ruud Gullit and Mick McCarthy having agreed, with 20 minutes or so to go, to play out a draw in their final group game at Palermo’s Stadio La Favorita to shaft Egypt and ensure they both went through, the Dutch and Jack Charlton’s Republic of Ireland finished with identical records behind England in Group F. It was the Dutch who drew the short straw that pitted them against Germany, while the Republic of Ireland advanced to play against and beat Romania.The challenge earned Rijkaard a booking from the Argentinian referee, Juan Carlos Loustau. It was his second of the tournament and meant he would miss the quarter-final should Holland progress. Maddened by his entirely deserved punishment, Rijkaard was enveloped in red mist and, as he jogged past Völler to take up his position for Andy Brehme’s free-kick, he spat in the German’s carefully coiffured mullet. Verbals between the pair ensued, at which point Loustau booked Völler, ignoring the German’s incredulity and accompanying invitation to examine the gobbet of spittle that had recently been deposited in his hair.With order of a sort restored and the Germans ambling into the penalty area for the as yet untaken free-kick, Völler appeared to explain to his strike partner Klinsmann that he had been spat at, then took up his position. Floated into the area by Brehme, the ball was nodded towards the edge of the six-yard box, where the goalkeeper Hans van Breuckelen grabbed it, having dashed off his line to do so. Having followed in to contest the ball, Völler appeared to do all he could to avoid clattering Van Breuckelen in mid-air but an incensed Rijkaard attempted to drag Völler to his feet by the ear, then stamped on his foot, prompting the German to fall to the ground.With Van Breuckelen and Klinsmann valiantly attempting to act as peace-makers, Loustau promptly brandished his red card in the direction of Rijkaard, before turning and showing it to Völler too. The hard done by German could scarcely have looked more appalled and to this day remains mystified by the official’s decision to issue him with his marching orders.“Of course it wasn’t nice what Frank Rijkaard did but the match should have continued for me,” he said years later in an interview with FourFourTwo magazine. “I still can’t understand why the ref sent me off and I guess he will take it to his grave. He wanted to make an example of both of us so that the situation would calm down – which did work. There was some venom before between other players but, you know, it’s always problematic between Germany and Holland.”With Völler standing there stoically pondering the injustice of it all, Rijkaard was lurking in the background, studiously clearing his mucous membranes by hoiking up the mother of all grollies. As he walked past Völler en route to the dressing room, he casually turned his head and flobbed the mouthful of slimy gloop he had just harvested from his nasal turbinate straight into his rival’s hair. Völler’s head snapped to the right as he glared at his opponent, then rubbed his hand through his curls in an attempt to locate the offending phlegm, which could be seen dangling from the back of his head. As Rijkaard was being escorted up the touchline towards the dressing rooms by a Dutch team official, Völler broke into a jog, looking for all the world as if he might attack his saliva-spewing assailant and prompt all hell to break loose. Rather disappointingly he chose to be the bigger man and merely cantered past his rival without so much as a sideways look.“Spitting is universally recognised as perhaps the ultimate degradation and it’s bound to result in rather aggressive retaliation,” mused the consultant psychologist Dr Aric Sigman years later, in some nostalgia-based clip show or other. Dr Sigman may well be right but rather intriguingly Völler proved the exception to the rule by refusing to retaliate in any way, aggressively or otherwise, bearing his multiple punishments and degradations at the hands of both referee and opponent with a stoicism that bordered on the truly heroic.“And now, an absolute sensation here in Milan,” declared Moore on ITV, as both footballers left the arena. “One that will do little for the game, I have to say on the night. Both sides reduced to 10 men ... Völler running off to the dressing room, Rijkaard taking a more leisurely pace. And as they went past, there was even a possibility Rijkaard may have spat at Völler, but the place is in uproar now.”On Irish television the incident was replayed time and again, mainly for yuks and giggles. As RTE ringmaster Bill O’Herlihy tut-tutted in a fatherly and faux po-faced fashion, pundit Eamon Dunphy got to work with his new toy, an electronic pen with which he could enhance and illustrate his analysis by drawing white lines, circles, arrows and squiggles on a monitor after pausing the VT with an often aggressive roar of “Stop it there!” at some unseen flunkie in the production suite.It was a technological advance Dunphy would use to comical effect some years later, pausing the action during a highlights package featuring Wimbledon to draw a large circle around John Hartson’s ample buttocks and declare “that is not the arse of a £7m player”. On the night Germany beat the Dutch, his analysis of the incident was peerless and priceless. “Rijkaard launches the spit from here, now stop it there,” he observed, before getting to work with his magic pen and charting the trajectory of the offending gully with an illustrative squiggle. “There it is, Bill. It’s hitting his head there and that’s bad news for Rudi Völler and even worse news for his hairdresser!”Meanwhile on the BBC, a completely farcical turn of events was being treated with the utmost gravity. “Please, parents, turn the videos off now because that is just absolutely scandalous,” intoned Ray Wilkins solemnly, considerately thinking of the children but paying scant regard to the ratings.In a subsequent interview with Simon Kuper Rijkaard was quick to accept all the blame for the incident and equally quick to put paid to suggestions that Völler might have insulted or even racially abused him. “That day I was wrong,” he said. “There was no insult. I always had much respect for Rudi Völler. But I went berserk when I saw that red card. I talked to him after the match and I apologised. I’m very happy that he accepted. I have no bad feeling about him now. We even posed for a very funny advert together years after.”The advert in question was for butter and featured both men sporting wide grins, cream dressing gowns and their trademark (but mercifully saliva free) curly hairstyles while seated at the breakfast table. “A Dutch butter company came up with the idea of a public reconciliation under the slogan ‘Everything In Butter Again’, which is a German proverb meaning that everything is OK again,” said Völler. “The fee was donated by both of us to charity, otherwise I wouldn’t have joined in.” In a rather undignified but amusing manner dignity had finally been restored."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d972132ba35040bd874501aef35e2e44a3b4849e/581_103_2612_1568/master/2612.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d76ad0860a18c971454ceaff079ea6d","title":"celtic v motherwell 2018 scottish cup final live","story":"78 min: James Forrest whips the ball across the edge of the six-yard box, trying to pick out Moussa Dembele, but Tom Aldred does a good job in defence for Motherwell. Dembele really deserves a goal here - he’s been outstanding.77 min: Celtic win a corner from which nothing comes, followed by some comic relief from one of the referee’s assistants, who trips over his own feet while trying to get out of the way of the ball as it comes his way.75 min: Another Celtic substitution: Kristoffer Ajer off with some sort of niggle, Jozo Simunovic on.70 min: Dembele misses two great chances in quick succession. He gets on the end of a Callum McGregor cross from the right and sends a bullet-header towards the top corner. Somehow, brilliantly ... Trevor Carson saves, getting one hand to the ball and keeping it out. The Motherwell goalkeeper then gets down to save the follow up, also from Dembele, with his feet.67 min: Half-chances for both sides, which are missed by Dembele and Bigirimana. Dembele really should have done better, shooting wide from an excellent position and the Motherwell goal apparently at his mercy.64 min: Moussa Dembele is terrorising the Motherwell defence this afternoon. Spotting him out of the corner of his eye, Cedric Kipre panics and launches a bouncing ball into the stands rather than control it and pass back to his goalkeeper.64 min: Motherwell get a rare shot on goal, but Chris Cadden fires straight at Craig Gordon. 62 min: Another booking for Motherwell, as Allan Campbell has his name taken for a late challenge on Scott Brown.59 min: Ryan Bowman is penalised for a nasty studs-up challenge on Mikael Lustig, who wins a free-kick deep inside his own half. The ball is thumped long to Moussa Dembele, who clearly has his jersey pulled by Tom Aldred as he wins, but only half-controls, the ball in the Motherwell penalty area. Celtic’s players and fans appeal for a spot-kick, but don’t get one.56 min: Motherwell substitute: Carl McHugh off, Gael Bigirimana on. The skipper is replaced and Ryan Bowman takes the armband.54 min: A lightning fast Celtic counter-attack, again involving Kieran Tierney, ends with James Forrest miscuing horribly and screwing a decent chance horribly wide from the edge of the area.52 min: Another cross from Tierney results in a Celtic corner. Olivier Ntcham’s delivery is atrocious.51 min: A constant threat on the left, Kieran Tierney whips a low cross into the penalty area, trying to tee up Moussa Dembele for a tap-in. Trevor Carson is quick off his line to foil the striker. 50 min: Tom Rogic drives forward from midfield with the ball at his feet and tries a shot, which takes a deflection away from goal. 49 min: Allan Campbell gets a sight of goal and tries his luck from distance. His long range effort is on target, but Craig Gordon saves comfortably. 47 min: Chance! Curtis Main brings a good save out of Craig Gordon after getting on the end of a pull-back from the by-line. The Celtic goalkeeper gets a strong hand to the ball and puts it out for a corner, from which nothing comes. The chance came on the back of good work down the right wing from Chris Cadden, who’s been moved further forward.46 min: Motherwell get the ball rolling for the second half, needing to score next to have any chance of clawing their way back into this final. They started reasonably well, but were completely outclassed from the 10th minute on. Celtic get forward immediately and Kieran Tierney sends a cross towards Mooussa Dembele. Trevor Carson claims well.It’s been men against boys for most of the first half and Celtic look home and hosed already. Callum McGregor and Olivier Ntcham got the goals against a Motherwell side that appear to have no answers whatsoever for the many difficult questions they are being posed. They’ve had a couple of half-chances without ever really threatening and seem to be resorting to bully-boy tactics in the absence of any better ideas on how to compete.Celtic won’t mind that one bit and if Motherwell get a man sent off, as seems likely, any faint hope they have of getting back in this contest will disappear down the tunnel with him.45 min: Crikey! There’s another late tackle on Tierney, this time from Allan Campbell, who escapes a booking. 44 min: Liam Grimshaw gets booked for a late barge on Kieran Tierney. Their players seem to think they can intimidate the (vastly experienced) youngster, but he’s making mugs of them at the moment. 42 min: Another counter-attack from Celtic, with Dembele showing great strength to muscle his way up the centre of the pitch with Callum McGregor up in support. Dembele tries to play him through on goal, but puts too much welly on his pass and a good opportunity goes begging. Motherwell looked very stretched at the back there.40 min: Motherwell win a free-kick about a third of the way inside the Celtic half. The ball’s played to Cadden at the edge of the penalty area, he tries to pick out Curtis Main, but the ball runs wide.39 min: Motherwell win a corner. The ball’s lofted in the Celtic penalty area, where Dedryck Boyata heads clear.38 min: Assuming they go on to win this final, Celtic will have an open-top bus parade back to Celtic Park afterwards. Then, after a night of presumably alcohol-drenched celebrations, they and their fans have to rouse themselves for Scott Brown’s testimonial against a - sound the cliche klaxon - Republic of Ireland XI tomorrow.37 min: Just before that booking, Tom Rogic missed a decent chance to further increase Celtic’s lead, but stabbed the ball straight at Carson when it fell to him near the penalty spot. 36 min: Richard Tait gets the first yellow card of the game for leaving one in on Kieran Tierney as the Celtic defender attempted a clearance. It’s been a noticable tactic from Motherwell’s players and quite a few have got spoken to about it by the referee, who has obviously run out of patience.34 min: Olivier Ntcham did a series of acrobatic somersaults by way of celebration for his goal and looking at replay now, it’s funny to see how his team-mates were very careful to wait until he was finished before going to congratulate him. 31 min: Celtic continue to dominate and just a third of the way in, it’s difficult to see any back for Motherwell. They’re being completely outclassed, much like our Scottish football correspondent Ewan Murray predicted.29 min: A tip of the hat to Moussa Dembele, whose hold-up play in the lead up to Celtic’s second was outstanding. He laid it off to Ntcham, who didn’t catch the ball particularly well, but hit it accurately enough to go in the bottom corner. Motherwell defender Cedric Kipre turned his back to the ball and it clipped his heel on the way in, leaving goalkeeper Trevor Carson with no chance.28 min: Curtis Main tries his luck from distance for Motherwell, but fires over the bar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09eae3985ad3e5e1c09e5414f44cbaf7e736441e/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dc4f9fad927b8a3719f94895b1b3090","title":"chelsea v manchester united 2018 fa cup final live","story":"Chelsea make three changes to the team that didn’t turn up at Newcastle on the final day of the Premier League last Sunday. Andreas Christensen, Emerson and Ross Barkley make way for Antonio Rudiger, Marcos Alonso and Cesc Fabregas.Manchester United played an experimental side against Watford last weekend. Ashley Young, Marcus Rashford and Alexis Sanchez are the only folk to make today’s starting XI as well. The big news for them: Romelu Lukaku is fit though he only makes the bench.Chelsea are hoping to avoid becoming the first club to lose back-to-back finals since Newcastle United in the late 1990s. Antonio Conte will be desperate to avoid becoming the first manager to taste defeat in consecutive finals since Howard Kendall in the mid 80s. His side were in decent form for a while back there, with a five-game that took them to this final and within a sniff of fourth place in the League. But then came a home draw with Huddersfield and a miserable no-show at Newcastle. Conte has looked short of energy, his team listless. It’ll be a miserable end to the season if they can’t raise themselves one last time.But United didn’t have a great deal of late-season momentum either. They finished their Premier League card with a defeat at Brighton, a goalless draw at West Ham, and a nondescript home win over Watford. Though to be fair, second place had long been in the bag. A trophy would throw different light on a season during which Mourinho has copped flak from his own punters for his style of play. It’ll be a miserable end to the season if they can’t raise themselves one last time.Two slightly erratic teams, capable of great things as well as the odd misfire ... but they’ll both take a look at the recent head-to-head record and fancy their chances. United were victorious in the most recent clash: a 2-1 comeback win at Old Trafford ... but Chelsea won the other League meeting, back in November they also knocked United out of the cup last season. United have won two of the last three meetings between the clubs ... but those are their only victories in the last 15, a period in which Chelsea have won on eight occasions. So you can slice it according to preference.Welcome to our coverage of the 2018 FA Cup final. It’ll be the 137th staging of English football’s showpiece match, the third time it’s been contested between Chelsea and Manchester United, and the first to make use of the popular Video Assistant Referee feature. Throw in Antonio Conte and Jose Mourinho on the touchline, and this could be a whole world of fun.The clubs first met in the final in 1994. Sir Alex Ferguson’s first great United side had swanned their way to the Premiership, and were favourites to beat Chelsea, who had finished Glenn Hoddle’s first season in charge as player-manager in 14th position. Favourites, though not hot favourites, because Chelsea had beaten United home and away in the League, Gavin Peacock scoring the only goal on each occasion.It all looked like coming to pass again, when Peacock intercepted a poor Gary Pallister clearance, chested down, and caressed a glorious looping half-volley over Peter Schmeichel. It would have been one of the great FA Cup final goals ... but it came crashing back off the crossbar. The ball sailed back upfield, taking with it Chelsea’s hopes and dreams. In the second half, United, having been unusually lethargic, rediscovered their mojo. Eric Cantona, ice in the veins, rolled two identical penalties past Dmitri Kharine in six decisive minutes - the second having been awarded somewhat controversially when Frank Sinclair and Andrei Kanchelskis clanked together. A dispirited and disoriented Sinclair then slipped to let in Mark Hughes, Paul Ince set up Brian McClair for a tap-in, and United sealed their first double: 4-0.That final wasn’t considered a classic at the time. But it looks like the Matthews Final when compared to the time the teams next contested the prize in 2007. Not that Chelsea will care: having just been beaten to the Premier League by United, they completed a domestic cup double when Didier Drogba settled the first final at the new Wembley with four minutes of extra time remaining. Ryan Giggs had missed a golden chance a wee bit earlier, sliding in but not connecting properly from a couple of yards out. Petr Cech snaffled the scuffed shot, only to be bundled over the line by Giggs and his momentum. That’d get the VAR rock and rolling for a few minutes these days.So it’s 1-1 in finals between these two famous old foes. Someone’s got to edge ahead today, even if there must be extra-time and penalty kicks. And whatever happens, it’ll have a significant effect on the FA Cup roll of honour, because United will either match Arsenal’s record of 13 wins, or Chelsea will join Spurs as the third-most-successful club in history. Look!We’re due a classic final. There’s every chance this could be it. Why not? It’s Chelsea! It’s Manchester United! It’s the most storied old trophy in the world! It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c8d8898129f62b5a9a650a25ea935655bb9a0e0/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11c6ab48649e0608d24bd1e5e2004da2","title":"google facebook security data duckduckgo","story":"Over the past month I’ve tried my best not to use Google. I deleted my Facebook account. I’ve gone through all my phone and iPad apps, closing down the “permissions” that give them access to my calendar, camera, contacts and location. And I’ve switched to DuckDuckGo as my (home) web browser. Like millions of others I was astounded not just by the Cambridge Analytica revelations, but the industrial-scale data harvesting by Google revealed in that extraordinary article by Dylan Curran in the .After reading it, I picked a random day in 2014 to find out what Google had on me – and was astonished at the intensity of location tracking and snooping on all my movements.But my trial separation has been tough. I’ve (almost) completely finished with Facebook. But living without Google has been far harder.My partner calls me “iPaddy” for the amount of time I spend on the bloody thing – mostly reading and checking news sites. But a good thing about the iPad is that in “settings” it’s simple to switch out of Google and into DuckDuckGo as your default browser.DuckDuckGo, if you don’t know, is the search engine that promises not to intrude. “It’s sort of creepy that people at search engines can see all this info about you,” it says. Unlike Google, it doesn’t attempt to track you. It doesn’t store IP addresses or personalise your search results according to what past data it has built up on you.But does it work? There is nothing I’ve not been able to find while using it although, as I haven’t put every search request into Google and DuckDuckGo at the same time, it’s not an entirely scientific comparison. Results are displayed and ranked in a similar fashion to Google. There are ads, but you can go into settings and turn them off.The biggest drawback was mapping – DuckDuckGo puts you through to Apple’s service – although images aren’t great, either. Until you are off Google, you don’t realise what a beautiful thing its mapping features are. And my determination not to give away my location means I’m now assailed by pop-up boxes once I click on a site. Last Sunday I searched for films at my local Omniplex cinema. Google would probably know where I was, and send me to the page with listings appropriate to my local area. Now I have to click into the general cinema site, click past the location pop-up request, then manually select which cinema is my local. But these are small gripes and I’m very happy to continue with DuckDuckGo on my iPad.Changing ad settings has been enlightening. We’re warned that if we turn off personalised ads, we get a weirdly untailored experience. You\u0026nbspdo – but so what?Cutting free from Google on a smartphone is another matter. If, like me, you have a company paid-for Android-based phone linked to Gmail, you can hardly hide from Google. But I’m not prevented from turning off location services, and since my phone is the main way it tracks me, it\u0027s a small triumph.I was never a Facebook fan, so deleting it was entirely painless. But it doesn’t let you go without a fight. It said it would hold the door open for me to return, and not delete all my data, should I come back within a short while. It worked. A week later I came back on, as I needed to contact a Facebook group for work. But that has been the sum total of my Facebook life since. But then there’s WhatsApp, which has become the key way our wider family connects. It is, of course, owned by Facebook. Some companies you can’t escape from."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f507f994e644b259e54dba7f04e1b530495610be/1803_814_3394_2037/master/3394.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e16a3f443d031368a1a28be429a5540","title":"chelsea flower show domiz refugee camp iraq tom massey","story":"The creative, makeshift gardens at Domiz refugee camp have inspired Tom Massey’s show gardenDesigners often travel abroad to seek inspiration for their Chelsea show gardens, but their trips don’t usually entail an arduous journey by road, passing armed border guards because the nearest airport is closed.Tom Massey visited Domiz camp in northern Iraq earlier this year to find out how refugees are carving out makeshift gardens, in the hope of bringing some of that spirit of inventiveness to a Main Avenue Chelsea plot. It was an eye-opener for him, showing how people who arrived with nothing have recreated a tiny slice of their lives back home, mostly in Syria. “They are thrown together, given a basic shelter. It was humbling to see how important gardening and growing is to them and how much benefit green space gives,” he says.When the Lemon Tree Trust, which is sponsoring the garden, asked refugees what they missed most about home, they talked about the sounds of nature, their gardens, and trees. Many of them asked for seeds. They had begun raising songbirds and pigeons, crafting elaborate fountains from concrete, and carving productive beds from the dusty soil.And while Chelsea may be a world away from the fragile, harsh existence of a Domiz plot, the trust’s CEO, Stephanie Hunt, hopes visitors will be able to relate “gardener to gardener” to the story the garden will tell. “We wanted to elevate the discussion around refugees, and show they are more than the pain and hardship that they have seen – they want to move on, and their gardens bring them joy.”Massey’s show garden uses the same limited set of raw materials that the 26,000 refugees at Domiz have access to – concrete and steel – plus ordinary objects they repurpose, from tin drums to plastic bottles. At the centre is an Islamic-inspired fountain fed by rills of water that radiate from it one of the boundary walls is covered with gutter pipes and cans filled with plants and fig, pomegranate and lemon trees offer shade, scent and food. “Lots of people I met said their gardens are places for escape, so I wanted to create areas where people could sit and listen to running water,” Massey says. “The plants have a strong sensory nature to transport them to other places.”The show garden won’t be a carbon copy of the refugees’ plots. “It has to have a certain Chelsea polish, or it won’t work.” That gloss comes in the form of polished rather than poured concrete, steel cut by laser rather than basic tools, and a palette of plants specially grown by the nursery Hortus Loci.Will the average Chelsea visitor engage with this garden’s message? Massey thinks so, but then, he’s already tested the water: one of the two show gardens he designed at the RHS Hampton Court show in 2016 was sponsored by the UN Refugee Agency. This conceptual garden, called Border Control, highlighted the dangerous journeys refugees make. “It’s nice to see gardens like this at big shows – that it’s not just high-end gardens without much message behind them,” he says.For Massey, it’s been a steep learning curve: he is making his Chelsea debut less than three years after he started practising. He studied animation then went into advertising, but found there was “too much sitting in a dark room”, so retrained as a garden designer. “I have always had a deep connection to the landscape. I grew up in Richmond with the park on my doorstep and spent long summers in Cornwall going a bit feral,” he says.While at Domiz, Massey explored the Mesopotamian plain that surrounds the camp, a bioersity hotspot packed with unfamiliar species. He was accompanied by Dr Sami Youssef, a bioersity expert who had been a refugee in the camp and was instrumental in starting the trust’s growing garden there Youssef had found several previously unrecorded plant species growing nearby. Massey has drawn on Youssef’s knowledge to ensure his own garden uses the right species.“Meeting Sami really underlined that a refugee camp is filled with ordinary people,” Massey says. “Journalists, designers, architects, botanists, farmers, teachers, decorators – all just doing their best to survive.”The Pearlfisher garden, by John Warland, will bring the beauty and fragility of marine life to west London, highlighting the urgent issue of plastic waste in the seas. Cacti and succulents will mimic coral, and air plants become floating algae.The Cherub HIV garden, by Naomi Ferrett-Cohen, focuses on the story of a young person living with HIV, with white pods representing clinics.The Embroidered Minds Epilepsy garden designed by Kati Crome explores the effects epilepsy had on the designer William Morris’s family."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1d632d14b1603492bda8d01e9a02cf4d09660bb/0_684_4771_2864/master/4771.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff210e8e197dc1a3eaaeca53cde9ce13","title":"six weeks get to know my grandfather","story":"My mother told me that he had abandoned her and her sisters but meeting him properly and finding out why made me forgive himGrowing up, I barely knew my grandfather. I knew all sorts about him, from my mother: that he could knit, for example, and that he adored cricket that he was a social worker and had become the UK’s first director of social services that he was a Quaker, and had been a conscientious objector in the second world war. She also told me that, after the early death of their mother, he had completely failed her and her younger sisters by marrying again very quickly, and more or less abandoning them.It was hard to square her charming portrait of Denis with his failure as a father – and grandfather. For many years, I was haunted by the unbearable sadness of the story, and a desire to better understand what had happened.As it turned out, I was to get my chance: a six-week window at the end of his life to get to know him and solve the puzzle.My mother is the eldest of four. The girls grew up with “all the luxuries and none of the necessities”: a piano, for example, but no curtains. Their mother, Rita, was a great collector of waifs and strays, and their shabby homes (they moved a lot) were always bursting with guests. One of those guests was Marjorie, a young colleague of Denis’s – deaf and very much alone in life. Then Rita died, and Marjorie became Denis’s wife – and the archetypal wicked stepmother.She got rid of all of Rita’s things, including the family dog and, the minute they were old enough, the daughters. Once they had left home, they weren’t welcome back and she didn’t like Denis visiting them. The story made me angry, but with Denis rather than Marjorie. How could he have put Marjorie’s needs over those of his bereaved girls?For my mother, Marjorie was the villain. Like the fathers in the fairytales, Denis was simply mysterious. And yearned for. She put a lot of effort into keeping in contact, sending him letters and birthday cards, and encouraging his rare visits. When he was 70, Denis briefly asserted himself over Marjorie, and invited his daughters and their families to Devon to celebrate his birthday. For me it was an impossibly poignant event. The weather was beautiful, and we picnicked on the beach. My mother and aunts were childlike in their eagerness to connect with their father to please him. Denis, a handsome man with more than a touch of David Attenborough about him, paddled in the sea and got us playing cricket. Marjorie also attended. Shy rather than villainous, her deafness very apparent, she didn’t like the sun and sat away from us in the shade of the cliffs. In contrast, I felt Rita to be everywhere – although her name was never spoken.After the birthday, things returned to as they had been and I didn’t see Denis for seven years. Then in November 1996, when I was 31, my mother phoned to tell me that he was in hospital, dying. He wanted to write a memoir and had requested my assistance, having heard that I had provided such a service to a terminally ill woman a few years before. I said yes straight away. This was my chance to get to know him and maybe get some answers.Denis and Marjorie lived in Exeter. Marjorie, as it happened, was in another hospital having an operation but she didn’t want me staying in their empty house. Quaker friends of Denis’s offered to put me up. I found Denis in a dingy ward, curtained off from the other men. Frail in his hospital gown, he gazed warily at me over his oxygen mask, and I thought for a moment that he didn’t recognise me. But then he removed the mask and reached for my hand. “I’m so glad you’re here,” he said, settling me into the bedside chair. “Have you brought your notebook?”Aware of his impending death, Denis was on a mission. For the next six weeks, he talked slowly, resorting to his mask in between sentences, so it was easy to scribble it all down. Every few days I would type up my scrawls and bring back the printed sheets for his plentiful corrections. As I got to know him, I found myself yearning for a deeper connection – to be more than a scribe. In a bid for intimacy, I told him about the pain of being in love with a man who didn’t love me. He nodded, but said nothing. And then sighed and said, “Shall we get on, then?”It was his memories of childhood that he wanted to capture for posterity. I felt frustrated, wanting to fast forward to events that involved my mother, but I gradually became absorbed in the story he wanted to tell.He had been one of five brothers. His parents had an unhappy marriage. His father, Jack, may have had schizophrenia, or what was then called shellshock, but Denis’s memories were of a kind and caring man. When Denis was four, Jack ran away with him. They went to Suffolk on a motorbike, Denis in the sidecar, thrilled to have been chosen as his father’s partner in adventure. His memory was one of profound happiness, listening to the pop-pop of the engine under the deep green of Suffolk foliage. Then the police found them, Denis was returned to his mother, and Jack was forbidden to darken their door. His mother remarried and went abroad with her new husband, and Denis and his brothers were given charity places at a boarding school.Denis enjoyed school. He played cricket and climbed trees, and fell through the ice of a frozen pond. Sightings of his father were poignant but, as Denis admitted, not necessarily real. Once, when he was playing cricket, Jack materialised on the side of the pitch. Overjoyed, Denis did his best to play well, feeling his father’s eyes on him. When the match was over, he turned towards him – but Jack was gone. I was charmed by this schoolboy, whose vitality triumphed over his sadness and also struck by the theme of abandonment. I felt I was getting an answer to the questions I didn’t dare to ask, an answer that finally took shape during an anecdote about a rare holiday with his mother and brothers in a seaside hotel. One morning, she mentioned almost in passing, that their father had died some time ago. The news stunned him and he went upstairs to weep. It later emerged that Jack had died in France, alone, in poverty.After the recounting of this episode, we spent some time in silence, Denis’s eyes bright blue disks, much fierier than the mottled red of his cheeks. “Death was much harder to talk about, back then,” he said. “They had an awful lot to learn about children’s emotional needs.”“But what about your daughters’ emotional needs?” The question burst out of me, my heart thumping hard. He nodded and tried to speak, but wept instead, full of remorse, and in that moment I forgave him. I hugged him, crying too. I had my explanation. Having been failed as a child, Denis then failed his own children. Emotionally damaged, he inflicted that same damage on the next generation. Looking back, I see the theme of abandonment had played out in my own life. Most obviously, it had led me to working on an oral history project with children in care. Much later, I wrote a novel about a boy whose mother has disappeared.He lived for another year. He made a kind of miracle recovery and Marjorie took him home, and cared for him there. I got his memoir printed and sent a copy to him in the post. I heard that on the morning of his death, he watched England win the Ashes and, ecstatic, leapt out of his wheelchair. “I’m getting better and better, and younger and younger!” he cried. “I can walk! I can skip!”He died mid-skip. When I think of that moment, I see the vital schoolboy I finally got to know so well during those six weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1db28951bc4da99d565e8a4864fba80d77242131/0_233_5457_3274/master/5457.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8d133e30a886daa10ddd055945844e8","title":"yotam ottolenghi barbecue recipes","story":"Thai skewers, beetroot with pickled chilli and scotch bonnet bass will bring the heat to your garden even if the weather doesn’tEvery year, I end up testing barbecue recipes in the rain, with an umbrella balanced precariously on one shoulder, but this year’s mission coincided with the hottest April week in 70 years. Barbecue sales doubled, supermarkets ran out of burgers, rosé and sun cream, and I leapt on the balmy bandwagon by celebrating the spring sun with ingredients from Mexico to Thailand. I’m keeping my fingers crossed for more scorchers this summer, but there’s enough chilli heat here to keep us all nice and warm, just in case.If you can’t get hold of onglet, which is a great secondary cut of beef that’s perfect for the barbecue, experiment with other cuts such as rump or sirloin.

Mix all the marinade ingredients in a non-reactive container, then add the meat and toss to coat. Leave to marinate for at least two hours (and up to two days).For the dressing, mix the first five ingredients in a small bowl. In a separate small bowl, mix the spring onions, chilli, peanuts and pumpkin seeds. Add half this mixture to the soy sauce mixture and set the rest aside – you’ll use it as a garnish.Drain the meat in a sieve set over a medium saucepan to catch the marinade in the pan discard the aromatics. Put the marinade on a medium-high heat, bring to a simmer and cook for about three minutes, until reduced and thickened to the consistency of a glaze.Line a work surface with a few sheets of clingfilm, then spread the meat out in a single layer on top. Cover with a few more sheets of clingfilm, then use a rolling pin to bash the meat until it is very thin – about 2-3mm thick. Thread the meat on to the soaked skewers (about 80g meat per skewer), then brush with a little oil and grill on the barbecue for about four minutes, turning a few times and basting with the reserved glaze until the meat has deep char marks and is golden brown all over. Leave to rest for a few minutes, then transfer to a serving plate.Drizzle the dressing over the meat, sprinkle the reserved herb and peanut mixture on top, and serve hot.If you’re using shop-bought cooked beets, look for ones with no added vinegar, salt or sugar. Don’t worry if your barbecue doesn’t have a resting rack, but do ensure that you’re cooking the beetroots over the very coolest coals for the first 30 minutes. Use recyclable foil trays if you’re worried about damaging a baking tray.Prep 12 minMarinate 30 min+Cook 40 minServes 4 as a side10 makrut lime leaves, stalks discarded, roughly chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped 1-2 limes, zest finely grated, to get 2 tsp, then juiced, to get 1½ tbsp90ml olive oilFlaked sea salt525g cooked beetroot, shop-bought or freshly cooked, drained and quartered1 small red chilli, finely sliced on an angle1½ tbsp white-wine vinegar½ tsp caster sugar1 tbsp maple syrup120g creme fraiche1 tbsp coriander leaves, finely chopped1 tbsp dill leaves, finely choppedPut the first four ingredients, three tablespoons of the oil and a teaspoon of flaked sea salt in a spice grinder and blitz to a loose paste.

Keep the remaining paste for serving.Spread out the beets on a baking tray, place this on the resting rack of the barbecue over the coolest coals, close the lid of the barbecue and cook for about 30 minutes, until soft and lightly smoked.While the beetroot is cooking, put the chilli in a small bowl with the vinegar, sugar and half a teaspoon of flaked sea salt. Leave to pickle for at least 30 minutes, or up to three hours.Brush the beetroot quarters with a tablespoon of the oil and the maple syrup, then put them directly on the grill in a hotter area of the barbecue and cook for four to five minutes, turning regularly, until they’re covered in good char marks.Spread the creme fraiche on a large plate and top with the beetroot quarters. Spoon the remaining makrut lime paste evenly over the beetroot, then sprinkle over the herbs. Drizzle over the remaining oil and finish with the pickled chilli and a generous sprinkle of flaked sea salt.This is meant to be enjoyed like tacos, where you pile the fish and condiments into tortillas. The fish on its own, with its deep-flavoured, black garlic marinade, will also work a treat with only a squeeze of lime for company, but the dipping sauce is so good, and easy, it would be a shame not to make that, too. In fact, you may well end up hooked on the stuff and find yourself wanting to eat it with all sorts.4 small sustainably sourced sea bass (250-300g each), cleaned, scaled and patted dry (or sea bream, black bream or similar firm-fleshed fish)Salt2 tbsp vegetable oilFor the marinade30g black garlic cloves (about 15)2 tsp ground cumin2 tsp ground coriander1 scotch bonnet chilli, deseeded1-2 limes, zest finely grated, to get 1 tsp, and juiced, to get 2 tbsp½ tsp soft light brown sugar1 tbsp pul biber (Turkish chilli flakes or ½ tbsp of regular chilli flakes)60ml olive oil1 tsp flaked sea salt, plus extra to seasonCorn tortillasFor the dipping sauce1 scotch bonnet chilli, deseeded and finely chopped1 small garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped5g spring onion, finely chopped2 tbsp lime juiceFor the herb salad10g mint leaves10g coriander leaves2 spring onions, finely sliced on an angleFlaked sea salt, to tastePut all the marinade ingredients in the small bowl of a food processor and blitz to a smooth paste.

Cover the fish tightly with foil, to keep warm, while you toast the tortillas.Put a large, cast-iron pan on the barbecue over the hottest coals and, once very hot, lay as many tortillas as will fit in the pan at a time and toast for a minute or so on each side, until warmed through and nicely charred on both sides.Open the foil parcels, transfer the fish to a large serving plate and serve hot with the tortillas, dipping sauce, herb salad and reserved black garlic marinade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cfd44e76681b100ff3f24b00e375fffba3b3353/127_51_1373_824/master/1373.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7f9fc170989659d3007c1ed9045d337","title":"goa beach dogs in pictures","story":"Photographer Dougie Wallace turns his lens away from the pampered dogs of the world to its antithesis: the beach dogs of Goa.

May’s other nominees are Diana Barran, Catherine Meyer, the founder of Action Against Abduction who is married to former US ambassador Sir Christopher Meyer, and Amanda Sater, a former party deputy chair.The nominations will tilt the balance of the chamber slightly in favour of May, taking her party’s total of peers from 244 to 253. But no party has a majority in the 780-strong upper house, and the government has been so heavily defeated on some amendments that introducing a handful of more supportive peers will only make a modest difference in getting Brexit through parliament.The DUP will nominate the former MP William McCrea, who has been criticised for sharing a platform in the past with Billy Wright, a loyalist paramilitary. Only McCrea’s name emerged, despite rumours that the DUP was initially offered at least one other nomination.Labour was granted three nominations, and Jeremy Corbyn put forward the former party general secretary Iain McNicol and the race equality campaigner Martha Osamor, the mother of the MP Kate Osamor, as had been expected. The third nominee is Pauline Bryan, a Scottish campaigner and editor of What Would Keir Hardie Say?, a collection of essays once given by Corbyn to Barack Obama.The proposed elevation of Osamor was immediately criticised by a Jewish campaign group after it emerged that she was one of several signatories to a 2016 letter complaining about the suspension of Ken Livingstone and others over antisemitism. Arguing that the suspensions were McCarthyite, the letter said the charges of antisemitism were being used to “silence criticisms of Israel … and undermine Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn”.Gideon Falter, the chair of the Campaign Against Antisemitism, said that elevating Osamor was a “two-fingered salute” to the Jewish community, and that Corbyn’s decision was “telling us not only that he sees her behaviour as unproblematic, but that he sees it as being worthy of the highest honour and a lifelong seat in the House of Lords”.Political peers are nominated periodically at the initiation of Downing Street in a behind-the-scenes haggling process, which in this case began in November, and starts with a debate about how many each party is granted. Names are suggested informally and canvassed before the House of Lords appointments commission to see if they meet the appropriate financial and legal standards before finally being formally submitted.The Liberal Democrats did not make any nominations, although it is well represented in the chamber with 98 peers. Dick Newby, the party’s leader in the Lords, said: “This is a cynical response from Theresa May to losing a string of votes in the Lords in recent weeks.”Lilley, a Thatcherite who has long been a Eurosceptic, was Margaret Thatcher’s trade secretary and then social security secretary in John Major’s government. At the 1992 party conference he sang about his “little list” of benefit fraudsters and was an energetic promoter of the idea that many people on social security were scroungers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04d57029ae6309f1441a44545d0c25ef186a2e4f/23_254_1970_1182/master/1970.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=669a94a01b7f8ebf9b29341d55e24797","title":"lewisham east byelection janet daby to stand for labour","story":"Council’s deputy mayor, who is viewed as a moderate, selected to fight for ultra-safe seat in JuneThe deputy mayor of Lewisham council has been chosen by Labour to fight a byelection in the area in June.Janet Daby, viewed as a moderate in the party, beat two other candidates after a hustings on Saturday to be selected as the candidate for the ultra-safe Labour seat of Lewisham East. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Daby was a “great campaigner” and he looked forward to working with her. The selection followed Heidi Alexander’s decision to stand down from parliament after being confirmed as London’s deputy mayor for transport.Daby, who has been a councillor in the area since 2010, is also director of the Whitefoot and Downham Community Food + Project, which tackles food poverty, and previously worked in social care. She said: “This is my home and I know the issues that matter to people because they are the same issues that matter to me. “We want a good hospital, we want decent affordable housing, we want a good education and fair opportunities for all our kids, we want a transport system that is fit for purpose and we want to live in a safe, welcoming borough where everyone can feel at home. “The Lib Dems-Tory coalition tried to close our hospital. I am proud to have been part of the campaign which stopped that, and I’m proud to have campaigned against the punitive Tory cuts that have put all our services under intolerable pressure.“I’m also proud to have campaigned against this government’s appalling immigration policies, which have caused so much heartache to a generation which helped us rebuild our country.”The Lewisham East constituency in south London is a safe Labour seat, with Alexander securing an overwhelming majority of 21,123 in the 2017 general election.Corbyn said: “It’s a great pleasure to welcome Janet Daby as our candidate in Lewisham East. She is a great campaigner and has already been lobbying me about Southeastern’s appalling train services.“She will be a great advocate for the people of Lewisham and I look forward to working with her should she be elected on June 14.” Paul Scully, Conservative party vice-chairman for London, said: “It’s disappointing to see that Labour have selected someone who for years has failed to deliver for Lewisham.

Saracens are back in the Premiership final. The mischievous had wondered whether they were a fading force, surrendering their Premiership title last season and suffering an unprecedented slump in the middle of this, but they have played their way back into form. Wasps were unable to cope.The visitors managed five tries, some spectacular in a predictably exhilarating festival of running rugby, but they were 20-0 down in the first quarter and 30-5 down at the start of the second half, unable to deal with a Saracens masterclass. None was more masterful than Owen Farrell, who kicked 11 from 11 for a haul of 27 points, a record for a play-off. It was good news all round for Eddie Jones.Saracens’ England contingent all looked a million dollars. On this form, England have every chance of turning round their own season too. Billy Vunipola looked punchy, but he was taken off at half-time, having received treatment on the half-hour.Wasps, meanwhile, lost Jack Willis with a nasty-looking knee injury, which may cost him his place on England’s tour of South Africa.Saracens have made it their business of late to put sides away in the second half, winning their past four matches by an average of 54-11. Their form might have been explained away by the procession of opposition they have faced with little or nothing to play for, but here was confirmation it had not been flattering.They did not wait until the second half to cut loose this time. They did not even wait till the end of the second minute. Farrell scythed between Joe Launchbury and Jake Cooper-Woolley after barely 90 seconds and found on his shoulder Alex Lozowski, who had run a brilliant supporting line, for the first try.Wasps were all over the place around the fringes, and the Saracens runners, from sufficiently various angles to confound a far meaner defence, poured through. Questions have been asked of the wisdom of Mako Vunipola’s touring with England, but he looked unstoppable with ball in hand. That said, Richard Wigglesworth could take his pick of the forwards presenting themselves at pace.Ten minutes later he chose Maro Itoje, another England player back in the swing, to crash through and Vincent Koch followed up for the try. Wasps thought they had replied almost immediately, Elliot Daly and Jimmy Gopperth combining spectacularly, but the latter’s arm was touch-in-goal before the ball was down.Saracens kept coming, but they would not score another try until the start of the second half. Three penalties did accrue from the boot of Farrell, one from a scrum, another area of dominance. It was Wasps, rather, who scored the second quarter’s only try, Christian Wade and Juan de Jongh sending Willie le Roux over.The game seemed over, though, two minutes into the second half, when Brad Barritt’s quick hands and Alex Goode’s draw-and-give put Chris Wyles over for a 30-5 lead. Surely curtains. Wasps had other ideas.Daly was unlucky to be denied a try by the TMO a couple of minutes later, but Wasps had their second when Cooper-Woolley barged through Nick Isiekwe from an attacking lineout, before Wasps hit their highest note yet. Wade took an inside pass to cut Saracens to shreds and turn the ball inside for Thomas Young to gallop 35 metres to the line. Wasps were back to within 11 with half an hour to play.It was then 10 with 20 to go. Farrell steadied Saracens with a couple of penalties, but Wasps struck again on the hour. Danny Cipriani sent Guy Thompson through a gap, and the latter sent Le Roux to the tryline for his second and a 36-26 scoreline.It was as close as Wasps would get. Saracens seemed exasperated by the way the visitors were now cutting them up, but they never seemed in trouble. They duly killed the game off with two tries in the next 10 minutes, Juan Figallo from short range after Shalk Brits had cut Wasps down the left, then Sean Maitland the right, and Itoje, who galloped home from rather further out.The carnival feel continued with another try apiece, one for the electric Wade, one for Ben Spencer, but Saracens’ minds had already, no doubt, turned to Twickenham."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18bf979bf88d366c324d691a018b9461582e2f23/0_12_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3f846d026cd06f73d705c75181ec643","title":"jos buttler england recall","story":"It might seem odd that English sport’s great invisible superstar is back in the Test team on the back of his Indian Premier League status but his selection is bold and sensibleEvery year in the US five people die and 10 million dollars of damage is caused as a result of deep-frying a turkey. This appears to be a festive tradition among bearded flag-draped men with hunting knives and baggy shorts, men for whom freedom’s just another word for caramelising your own arteries and shouting a lot on YouTube.But freedom comes at a cost. Each deep-fried turkey takes seven gallons of superheated fat. A special chain is required to lower it into its hell-cauldron. Moisture is the key issue: a pocket of concealed water inside the turkey can cause it to explode into a roiling spume of flames and fat.All things considered it would probably be more sensible to cook these turkeys in the oven, to play it straight. But then, you don’t get a special chain. You don’t get seven gallons of oil, or great melting mouthfuls of face-scalding fat-soaked bird, so tangy and moist and crispy-skinned you’re already salivating over it now.Bad ideas that look delicious. Delicious ideas that are – despite being delicious – also clearly very bad. Ideas that end up with everyone catching salmonella, the house on fire and England 86 for eight on a nibbly green seamer. There was a note of this in the first sight of England’s squad for the Lord’s Test against Pakistan next week with specific reference to the gripping, oddly decadent selection of Jos Buttler as a specialist No 7 batsman, given licence to wander out, sniff the air and basically make the game up in front of him.There is a degree of natural resistance to this, a sense that to pick Buttler is to devalue decisively the proving grounds of county cricket. Buttler averages 17 in four red‑ball games over the past year. His selection is at odds with all we have heard about the informed methods of Ed Smith, out there crunching his data curves, occasionally emitting a clank of excitement over some outstanding first-innings metrics from the strangely overlooked Cakebread-Thomas of Derbyshire seconds.Instead we have this. Faced with an ailing team and a general anxiety about how to make all forms of cricket more instantly comestible the selectors have reached for the most more-ish option have decided, basically, to just give up and deep-fry the turkey.And yet it is undeniably the right thing to do. Not playing Buttler when you have the chance to play Buttler: that really would be weird. “He hasn’t been picked because of the IPL,” Smith said this week. But he clearly has. Buttler has been picked, in part, because he is famous, because right now he is among the top three hottest, most luminously attractive cricketers in the current edition of the sixth biggest sporting league in the world.This is simply the truth and everyone involved should embrace it, because it’s both entirely sensible and entirely consistent with the England and Wales Cricket Board’s more gimmicky attempts to popularise the game. If we’re willing to junk the basic robustness of the sport via the Hundred, to introduce the new colts cricket rules trailed this week – ditch the lbw law, double-run maxi zones in the field – then it looks like old-school good sense to pick the most pop-famous cricketer in the country as often as possible.The fact is Buttler stands outside the normal rules and numbers. This has been said before about other cricketers. But in this case it’s actually true. He was a ludicrous spectacle in the IPL this year, driving and cuffing and gliding his way to 389 runs off 258 balls at an average of 97, with that familiar, beautifully delicate kind of violence in those whip-crack wrists.It is traditional at this point to suggest batting on pitches where the ball moves, where a flighty fifty can lose a game rather than win it, is a different matter altogether. Plus Buttler has been batting with a self‑made technique in India, adopting that white‑ball power hitting stance, front leg shifted to one side so he can hit in front of square from the same base, sending the ball through the field in a weird flat, scything arc.The thing is, it works. Just as moving up to open has worked, despite the need to adapt instantly to new angles, speeds, pressures. English cricket has no history of producing unorthodox players, certainly not at this global-genius level. But for once it is perhaps simply time to go with it.The real issue around Buttler’s career isn’t his ability to defend against the swinging ball. The absurdity of mature Buttler is that he is essentially a blank in his own country, a Category A sports person in a global game who could probably walk in and buy a plastic bat in the Catford branch of Sports Direct without anyone offering a yawn of recognition.This week the chairman of the ECB told us children just don’t like cricket. This is of course dangerous nonsense. The game is good. The talent is there. But it is also invisible to swathes of the population, just as Buttler has become English sport’s great invisible superstar, hidden away behind the high hedge on the last remaining patch of green.For an industry that spends a lot of time quivering and whining about what it doesn’t have, Buttler is the asset, the talent. Centre stage may be a little left of centre these days. But it’s time to get him out there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aae7ae97d32da1fd9caa8a5d56c564904cb5757/175_0_5206_3124/master/5206.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=453845dba4970de40e228f6388909fb6","title":"giro ditalia 2018 stage 14  monte zoncolan simon yates live","story":"Great ride from Domenico Pozzovivo, who fought back well. Froome celebrated that like it was one of his greatest triumphs. There is a week to go, and he is not completely out of this, though winning the Giro from here *would* be his greatest moment. Yates looks insanely comfortable: the face of a man in a deckchair, deliberating over a second cup of Earl Grey. Absolutely ridiculous.And Yates showed his mettle and form by almost taking the stage. He gets six probably vital seconds of bonus for finishing second in the stage. Dumoulins, though, is still very much in this, with a trademark gritty ride. He only lost 31 seconds on the leader. That’s been one hell of a race, living up to its billing. Froome, despite all his woes, has written himself into history with that win on one of the toughest climbs in cycling. Fabio Aru is over the line, but lost 2’ 26”. That’s the host’s best chance gone.. Pinot goes over the line and looks to have lost over a minute. Now for the clock, Dumoulins finishes fifth and will only lose 30 seconds on Yates. Froome leading into the last 200m. Yates cannot get there. Froome takes one of those vicious hairpins. The rain coming down with Yates on his tail. Yates now closing on Froome. This could be a photo finish....Dumoulins under the “one km to go” sign. He’s had a decent day, and might be happy that Yates has not made up too much time. Has Froome bonked? He’s into the first of three tunnels. The tunnel approaches for Froome, with one kilometre to go. But Yates is gaining. Froome is still out in front, and has shown he has fight left in him, a consolation when his dream of adding the Giro to Le Tour and the Vuelta is looking doomed.As it stands, Yates is going to take 25 seconds out of his chasers. Under 2.5km to go. Dumoulins and Pinot, Yates’ challengers are grouped together. Yates is gaining...tremendous ride from him. Froome threw the kitchen sink at it, but does he have anything left in the tank?Now Yates has a go, and he has blown Lopez and Pozzovivo away. Froome looks to be slowing but the gap is still at 11 seconds. Meanwhile, Yates has got 20 seconds on Dumoulins, which he would have targeted at the start of the day. The time trial on Tuesday has to be borne in mind. Froome is 11 seconds clear on Yates, who nevertheless looks cool. Froome needs to take minutes, not seconds off him. He kicks again, bathed in sweat. Lopez and Pozzovivo look to be pacing Yates up the hill. Froome is almost over the worst of the hill. Yates won’t want him to get too far clear but, barring disaster, the pink jersey will be his. And Froome is clear! The road is open for him to win this. Behind him, Pozzovivo and Yates, who can content himself that Dumoulins is falling back. Froome attacks! He’s got three minutes to make up. And Yates has dropped back.Chris Froome takes evasive action to shove a fan dressed as a dinosaur to the side of the road. It’s a cramped road, and people playing the fool are not welcome. We are under 5km now. Yates is strong, and sitting off Froome’s shoulder. Yates looked back to see where Dumoulins was, only to see his rival is still hanging on. The Sky Train is in session now. A familiar sight, maybe, but not one that has been in evidence in Italy this year. Poels and Froome are strong but Yates is in their slipstream. Michael Woods’ attempt for glory looks to have failed. The final, deadly five kilometres are approaching. Most of the favourites are in touch, with Pinot accompanied by a teammate. Aru’s chance has gone, it seems. Woods has a little daylight. Froome now looking in better nick and has moved up a bit. Yates is looking comfortable. And Aru has been dropped. Dumoulins struggling? Poels is still setting the pace. Woods has not been allowed to get away. Fabio Aru is out of the saddle as the race slips away from him. Michael Woods, the Canadian with EF Education First–Drapac, with an attack off the front. He’s in a pink jersey, though not the important one. Dumoulins is in deep in the pack, riding defensively as expected. Froome is ahead of him, while Yates is sat in an OK position. Conti is caught by Anton at the front, but the peloton is now within 15 seconds. Wout Poels has been attempting to lead the group but Froome doesn’t look in the form to take advantage of his teammates’ work.The road is flanked by heavy woodland meaning that the various bends are a real problem to negotiate and to catch sight of rivals. Rohan Dennis, previously in seventh, has been dropped. He has lost weight to get better at climbing, but it’s been too much. This road is narrowing, and this is the easy part. Gruelling stuff and far worse to come. Conti is hanging on grimly at the front. But he is now below 30 seconds ahead. We are under 9km already, and Simon Yates is looking good. Chris Froome way down the group. He looks a bit ragged, but that is no guide, considering the style that has brought him such success.Here’s where it begins. The peloton has caught up with all but the first two of the former breakaway. Igor Anton, a former winner of this stage, has kicked for victory early. Very early. The leading pair are heading through the gates.There are just 11km to go, but the real story will be written over the next hour or so. Talk of the start of the hill being known as the “gates to Hell”. From the top of the mountain, Ray tells me that the “cowbells are ringing here now”. The final descent is in place, just as calm and collected as the previous climb. The breakaway down to two men, Conte and Barbin. Their glory is done for now, though at least they will reach the Zoncolan first. Conti takes the points at the penultimate peak. Now for the Zoncolan..... Yates has three men alongside him in the dwindling peleton, including the experience of Roman Kreuziger. The leading group, their lead down to 1’10” are trying to gain those points. Valerio Conti is going for them, but this looks a last hurrah for the escapees. Here’s where the wildcat attacks start. There are mountain classification points to fight for. Yates leads that as well, and Chaves, out the back, has been looking after the jersey for him, won’t be collecting any points. A TV shot of the Monte Zoncolan shows the tifosi are dressed in sensible kagouls and with umbrellas at the ready. That breakaway group is down to 2’00” and dropping. Sunweb are pushing things along with Tom Dumoulin looking quite calm under his shades. Mitchelton-Scott have the front of the group, with Yates also staying cool. Live Fitba alert here. Barry Glendenning is beavering away on this one. Ok, we are at the bottom of the valley now. The Maglia Rosa group is small. This is where the fun begins. Just under 30km to go and it gets tougher all the way. Meanwhile, from the Monte Zoncolan itself, Ray Murphy, awaiting that final climb, has been in touch via Twitter (My DMs are open). Pissed rain earlier . Nice and sunny now .. crowds massive all the way up .. people camped everywhere overnight .. bbq making me hungry .. wonderful atmosphere.. great anticipation. Tremendous colour.If that descent has been a little safety first,  reader Dr Joe Street has emailed in a classic of the genre, Big Fabio Cancellara showing us how it’s done. It’s from Le Tour, but same rules apply.

This victory today is a big confidence for me. This tournament has been very positive for me after last week in Madrid. To come back to a final, I’m very happy.”Thanks a lot for your company this afternoon. That was some match-up, a riveting game between two heavyweights, teeming with some brilliant tennis. Kevin Mitchell’s report from Rome will appear below shortly.The first evaded him but a second match point was too good to turn down for Nadal, who plays a punishing forehand down the line. Victory is his, in another classic meeting between two titans of tennis. Nadal is into the Italian Open final, and he has a chance of his eighth title in Rome. Second set: Nadal* 7-6, 5-3 Djokovic (*denotes server): Nadal, unusually, plays a couple of wasteful shots, with Djokovic only too happy to gobble them up. But a revved up Nadal fights back with a thumping forehand in a rally of sublime shot-making to nip into a 40-30 lead. And then – how about this? A double fault by Nadal gifts Djokovic back in at deuce. Nadal nudges himself in front but, of course, the Serb comes up with one of those roaring forehands to peg Nadal back. A third deuce comes and goes for Djokovic and, after 10 minutes, Nadal eventually clinches it. Wow.Second set: Nadal 7-6, 4-3 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Djokovic is determined not to roll over but he must feel like it at times. Nadal plays a storming backhand, enough to get the seal of approval from the Serb, via a thumbs-up. But Djokovic has no plans of going anywhere just yet.Second set: Nadal* 7-6, 4-2 Djokovic (*denotes server): Nadal is proving a real monster out there, an omnipotent, unforgiving force out on centrale. He now races into 40-0 to restore his two-game lead. Second set: Nadal 7-6, 3-2 Djokovic* (*denotes server): A couple of big forehands earn Djokovic a lifeline in a game in which he looked really up against it. He almost surrenders it too but Nadal’s lob runs too long, beyond the baseline and Djokovic has a chance.Second set: Nadal* 7-6, 3-1 Djokovic (*denotes server): Nadal starts as he means to go on, with a thumping smash to take 15-0. His next serve is too hot for Djokovic to handle but, while his third is rasping, the Serb digs deep to produce a stunning backhand return. He earned that, but moved level at 30-30 after Nadal’s wild forehand – his first miscue of the set. But, these are just bumps in the road. Nadal takes it. Second set: Nadal 7-6, 2-1 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Nadal plays a magnificent, dipping volley over the net to tee up the first of three break points. And when Djokovic strikes long, Nadal turns the screw to clinch it.Second set: Nadal* 7-6, 1-1 Djokovic (*denotes server): A flurry of gorgeous shots, shifting Djokovic from one side of the court to another, see Nadal move into the distance. He plays a wonderful searching backhand and that’s sufficient to pull level. Second set: Nadal 7-6, 0-1 Djokovic* (*denotes server): After an exceptional tie-break of tennis, Djokovic’s first serve is horribly wide. He was livid after failing to get over the line in the first set, and presumably still seething. Nevertheless, he skips into a 0-40 lead with his third ace of the afternoon. Nadal can’t return his final serve and that, at least, was easy. Seventy-one minutes of world-class tennis, and it’s Nadal who eventually edges it. Can Novak Djokovic, who invested a lifetime of energy into that marathon set, bring it back? A wonderful, stunning set of tennis finishes 7-4 on the tie-break.First set tie-break: Nadal 6-4 Djokovic* (*denotes server): For a moment, it seemed Djokovic would get a slice of luck but his forehand teeters on the net before tumbling back on his side. Big point ...First set tie-break: Nadal* 5-4 Djokovic (*denotes server): A punishing crosscourt backhand sees Djokovic grind the gap back to a point.First set tie-break: Nadal* 5-3 Djokovic (*denotes server): Nadal has Djokovic on the ropes and the latter subsequently hangs a forehand long.First set tie-break: Nadal* 4-3 Djokovic (*denotes server): A timely moment for Nadal to play a 144mph beauty down the angle. First set tie-break: Nadal 3-3 Djokovic* (*denotes server): This has been some six points, a ridiculous love affair of tennis on centrale. More to come yet too ...First set tie-break: Nadal* 3-2 Djokovic (*denotes server): The Serb swoops down the line, tight to the sideline, and he perfects it to hit back.First set tie-break: Nadal* 3-1 Djokovic (*denotes server): Nadal, this time, dips into the reserve tank to return, return, and keep on returning, slamming a forehand down the court with Djokovic powerless.First set tie-break: Nadal 2-1 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Nadal delves into the back catalogue to deliver a rasping, relentless backhand. First set tie-break: Nadal 0-1 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Nadal gets his forehand volley all wrong, it’s clumsy and gifts Djokovic the lead – for now.First set: Nadal 6-6 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Nadal initally lures Djokovic in to the net as he fights to stay in it to earn 15-0. Djokovic then responds with a galling volley with Nadal still recovering. The Spaniard seems to run of steam with a flat forehand and Djokovic rises once more. His subsequent forehand down the line brings him to 15-40 before sealing a sublime game with a neat backhand. When the pressure was on, he made it look easy. We go to a tie-break, then. First set: Nadal* 6-5 Djokovic (*denotes server): Nadal badly needed that. Djokovic will have to serve to stay in the set again. First set: Nadal 5-5 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Djokovic hammers his first forehand into the tennis equivalent of Row Z. He’s not happy about that but takes the second point, a calm volley to move to 15-15. A sweet backhand then puts Nadal in trouble, in turn wrong-footing the Spaniard. Three games in a row for the Serb.First set: Nadal* 5-4 Djokovic (*denotes server): Nadal has Djokovic moving and shaking to get to 15-0 and an error from the Spaniard sees him welly a shot into the net. A thunderous rally then ends with Djokovic getting lucky after a bruising point, with his volley bumbling off the net and on to the clay. And, this time, Djokovic breaks Nadal’s serve. This is already proving quite an epic contest. First set: Nadal 5-3 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Nadal skips into a 15-0 lead when Djokovic strikes the net but he does not have it all his own way. Djokovic runs away with it, with a fine forehand from the baseline to boot. First set: Nadal* 5-2 Djokovic (*denotes server): Breathtaking tennis, irresistible stuff brings Djokovic to 0-30 and the crowd up on their feet. A swirling backhand, a couple of Nadal saves, an amazing get, but then Djokovic comes up with another wondrous effort. A ridiculous rally. And yet Nadal recovers to take the game – truly magnificent from the Spaniard.First set: Nadal 4-2 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Nadal strokes a beautiful forehand up the line and then Djokovic’s attempt to cut one short is flawed as it ripples the net. Just as Nadal looks to seize control at 30-0, Djokovic comes up trumps with a bending, dipping forehand and then another stunning winner, an arcing backhand. His next forehand is wide but he snatches a brilliant rally to pull him to deuce two geniuses are at work. But, eventually, Nadal punishes Djokovic’s long shot to take it. First set: Nadal* 3-2 Djokovic (*denotes server): It’s a little windy out on centrale, with Djokovic’s flailing back hand running long. Nadal strides into a 40-15 lead, with a thirsty forehand teeing up game-point. A series of sharp shots, after his serve was found to be in by Djokovic, clinches it. A classy touch by Djokovic, very sportsmanlike, to point out Nadal’s first serve was, in fact, not a fault. First set: Nadal 2-2 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Djokovic’s looping forehand plays into Nadal’s hands, but his survival instincts are enough to eke into a 0-30 lead. His delightful backhand drop shot wraps up the game with a degree of swagger. That was simply exquisite. Level-pegging. First set: Nadal* 2-1 Djokovic (*denotes server): Nadal’s father, Sebastian, and uncle, Miguel Angel, the former Barcelona footballer, both approve of two marvellous recovery shots, as the Spaniard grinds through the gears to 40-0. A double fault proves only a minor blip as Nadal takes the third game, with his next serve too much for Djokovic. The Serb looks a little startled, though it’s still early days of course. First set: Nadal 1-1 Djokovic* (*denotes server): A wild Nadal forehand gifts Djokovic a 0-15 lead. From there the Serb powers to 0-40, with a cute volley at the net. A rasping, swooning ace takes the game. Lovely. First set: Nadal* 1-0 Djokovic (*denotes server): Nadal’s first serve is straight into the net and his subsequent forehand long. Then Djokovic overpowers his return to take it to 15-15. Djokovic seems to have settled the quicker, with a striking forehand down the line and then Nadal can only find the net. Djokovic looks in the mood, his stamina strong in the rally but he squanders two break points. Nadal slams a backhand over to gain advantage and then his serve proves too strong. “Novak will have to summon up the spirits of the Gladiators to have a chance against Maximus Nadal Emperor of Clay,” tweets John McEnerney. “A three-setter would be great but Novak mightn’t have too much left in the tank after the last round, Rafa to march on to the final.”Nadal wins the toss and elects to serve. Renaud Lichtenstein, the Frenchman, is the man in the chair.Nadal and Djokovic step out on to the court to much ovation, these two always draw a crowd. It’s a beautiful sunny afternoon in Rome. The coin toss will be upon us any second and then we’ll be off ...Not long now until Nadal and Djokovic renew their rivalries on the centrale clay in Rome. It is 53 weeks, 371 days, 8,904 hours and 534,240 minutes since they last met, in Madrid, last year. That straight sets win ended a seven-match losing streak for the Spaniard against Djokovic:Pre-match viewing, courtesy of an angry Karolina Plíšková: Pre-match reading, courtesy of Kevin Mitchell in Italy:It seems odd that Rafael Nadal’s domination on clay in Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Paris has not been so evident in Rome, where he has a mere seven titles and last appeared in the semi-finals four years ago. Still, he will hardly complain and he will be mightily happy if he wins on Sunday as it will haul him back to No 1 in the world above the absent Roger Federer.The man he defeated 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 on Friday to reach the semi‑finals, Fabio Fognini, will afford the Spaniard little sympathy if he falls short. This was Fognini’s first quarter-final at his home tournament at the 13th attempt and he must have thought he could go further, or even all the way, when he came from 4-1 down in the first set to send Roman tennis fans into a frenzy on a perfect summer’s day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ec2eab47048bc4c64581b60916a677f40c6f349/0_128_3164_1898/master/3164.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06dc0b9f23958c0d51a7fcec7bb243a3","title":"shappi khorsandi review mistress and misfit","story":"Soho theatre, LondonIn her new show Mistress and Misfit the standup delivers droll tales, gasp-inducing skits and a Georgian history lessonMistress and Misfit, Shappi Khorsandi’s latest set, has been built around Admiral Nelson’s squeeze, Emma Hamilton. Or at least, that’s what it says on the tin. Certainly, there’s a portrait of Lady Hamilton on stage throughout the show, but for most of the 75 minutes it’s Khorsandi who hogs the limelight. We’re left with another erting hour of Shappi chat – about mothering, reality TV, her poet dad – grafted more or less crudely on to a whistle-stop biography of the blacksmith’s daughter turned love of a national hero.It’s never entirely clear why Khorsandi is telling that story in particular, beyond her obvious identification with Emma’s up-by-the-bootstraps life story. The comic makes a compelling case for Lady H as a strikingly modern figure, trapped in and stifled by life as a pawn and plaything of wealthy men. But Khorsandi’s parallels between her life and that of her Georgian-era subject are a bit forced, and Hamilton’s presence in the show – sitting alongside unrelated material about attending children’s parties and turning down literary prizes – can feel arbitrary.The literary award in question was the Jhalak prize for writers of colour Khorsandi reprises – but doesn’t much develop – material on the subject she trialled when last at Soho, 18 months ago. Elsewhere, jokes about Britishness and her dad’s exile from Iran are recycled from previous sets, as is the characterisation of her son and daughter as English and Middle Eastern stereotypes respectively. The newest material covers her recent stint on I’m a Celebrity – as caustic as you’d expect, even if her surprise at how idiotic the show turned out to be seems a mite disingenuous.It’s all likable enough – Khorsandi is nothing if not a convivial host – and there are droll sections on her social unease and on a pragmatic sexual encounter in Amsterdam that fosters her kinship with Hamilton. Another skit, quoting 18th-century reviews of Covent Garden prostitutes, raises a few gasps, and also the thought of how rich the show might have been had Khorsandi fully committed to its historical conceit.

We were tackling a stretch of the Vjosa, a 270km river that begins in Greece (where it is called the Aoös) and flows through Albania and into the Adriatic just north of the city of Vlora. I was on a recce trip for a new southern Albanian break with Much Better Adventures, which specialises in long weekends to wild places in Europe and North Africa. But this trip was not just a fun adventure – rather just part of a campaign to save the river, which is under threat from proposed dams. A documentary film, Blue Heart, out this month, will highlight the fight to protect Europe’s last wild rivers, with help from ecotourism.From May to October, the Vjosa’s canyons are navigable by raft – at thrilling speeds and with waves well over a metre high. We were there in early March, when these narrow stretches of water were too dangerous, so rafted a wider, gentler section: it offered less adrenaline, but gave a flavour of the full trip. Swirling downriver, we seemed to be journeying through an untouched land.Under communist dictator Enver Hoxha, Albania was cut off from the world for nearly 50 years in the postwar era, and still feels like unexplored territory – a rare thing only three hours’ flight from the UK. The river banks rose steeply to snowcapped mountains, and the only other people we saw were a couple of boys riding a donkey.Before the rafting, I met Olsi Nika from NGO EcoAlbania, to find out why this river is so special. “The Vjosa and most of its tributaries are completely undisturbed,” he said. “It is the last big, wild, free-flowing river in Europe outside of Russia.” He and other environmentalists want to keep it this way. “We have a vision to declare a national park, and offer ecotourism: rafting, kayaking, fly-fishing.”New river-based ventures are springing up, such as the Albanian Adventure Resort on the River Osum near Çorovoda, which will offer canyoning, riverboarding and more from next spring. And Albania’s mountains, soaring to 2,800 metres, have huge potential for hiking and climbing. The hope is that sustainable adventure tourism will offer a viable source of revenue for the country.But the environmentalists have a battle on their hands. The government plans to build eight major hydropower plants on the Vjosa, and another 20 or so on its tributaries as part of a massive Balkans hydro project. More than 500 hydropower plants are planned for Albania, among about 3,000 in the wider region. The consequences include loss of habitat and rare species, flooding, coastal erosion and compulsory resettlement, said Nika. “So 2018 is a crucial year for the Vjosa. There will be lawsuits, lobbying, scientific studies and artist-led protests.” As part of the battle, Much Better Adventures is working with Albanian activists and local operators such as the Albania Rafting Group to encourage people to book a trip.Besides rafting, we explored plenty of the rest of the country, taking in coast and historic sites. A highlight was the ancient city of Butrint, a Unesco world heritage site on a spectacular wooded peninsula, between a lake and a channel leading to the Straits of Corfu. After seeing the theatre, baptistry and other remains, we kayaked down the channel to Ali Pasha’s Castle, an island fortress named after the Ottoman ruler.Albania’s 426km of Adriatic and Ionian coastline offers excellent hiking, too. Saranda, the main resort on the Albanian Riviera, is very built-up but you don’t have to go far to find unspoiled beaches and clifftop hikes. We started 20km up the coast at Lukova, which has a few summer beach bars and restaurants, and walked for 90 minutes along the cliffs to Krorez Bay. This beach has golden sand, turquoise water and no tourists. We enjoyed a swim and snorkel, then scrambled up the sheer cliff and hacked our way through undergrowth to the next beach, dramatic Kakome, backed by thickly forested cliffs. (This beach is now privately owned, so walkers need permission to visit – our guides had phoned ahead.)We spent a night at a homestay in Peshtan, a tiny village close to the Vjosa. By day, we hiked to a lookout point where the river meets one of its tributaries – the view was worth braving a rickety wooden bridge over the canyon. By night, we sat under the stars in a villager’s garden, drank raki and listened to a impromptu performance of pleqërishte – polyphonic folk songs by local shepherds. This peaceful way of life would be destroyed by one of the planned dams.At the Benja natural spa, near the town of Permet, we bathed in a warm pool by the river and slathered ourselves in green mud. We had this wonder almost to ourselves but the baths are an important summer tourist attraction. They’re at the mouth of the Langarica canyon, where there are more hot springs and caves. Here, too, a dam is planned – if it goes ahead, the canyon will run dry and the springs will be put in jeopardy.We sampled city life in Gjirokastra (another Unesco world heritage site, for its Ottoman old town), about 55km north of Saranda. It is known for its 17th-century houses and bazaar, and 18th-century mosque. Ismail Kadare was born here and his former home is now a museum – the leading Albanian writer won the inaugural Man Booker international prize in 2005.We squeezed in a visit to Berat, too, (yet another Unesco site) on the way to Tirana. This is not on the regular itinerary, but well worth extending a trip for. Its 13th-century citadel has steep cobbled streets and Byzantine churches Ottoman houses tumble down the hill to the Osum river and climb up the other side. We stayed at the gloriously kitsch Castle Park hotel, a jumble of taxidermy and folk art in woods just outside town, and dined on the usual spread of homemade bread and olive oil, salads, grilled vegetables, cheese, spinach byrek (filled flaky pastry) and crispy lamb.It was a whirlwind insight into a place I’d gladly return to. A country with beaches, sunny climate, scenery and cuisine to rival far more popular Mediterranean destinations, with fewer crowds and at a fraction of the cost. Now is the time to experience its unspoiled beauty – and to help ensure it stays that way. Wait, and it could be too late. As Nika said, “If you put a dam in a river, you kill it forever.”How to do itThe trip was provided by Much Better Adventures, whose three-day Raft, Hike and Kayak Albania trip costs from £350, including accommodation, meals, local transport, guide and activities, but not flights.Getting thereFrom April to October, easyJet flies from Bristol, Gatwick, Luton, Manchester and Newcastle to Corfu from about £60 return Ionian Seaways has a 30-minute hydrofoil from Corfu to Saranda from €38 return.

The deal calls for changes to fiscal policy and a €780 (£680) monthly basic income for poor families.It also spells out a new crackdown on immigration, including a “serious and efficient” programme to drive out migrants who arrive in Italy illegally. The plan calls for more detention centres to be opened in every region, in which migrants could be held for up to 18 months.The agreement calls for an overhaul of the Dublin treaty, so that asylum seekers would be distributed across the EU instead of being required to stay in the country where they first arrive, and it calls for religious leaders to be registered with the state. All camps of “unregistered” Roma would be shut down under the plan.Italy’s general election on 4 March resulted in a hung parliament. Matteo Salvini, the head of the League, and the Five Star Movement’s Luigi di Maio have been locked in negotiations for weeks to agree on a common set of governing goals. The pair have still not agreed on who should serve as prime minister. The new government’s platform is expected to be approved by M5S members late on Friday in an online poll. On Monday, Di Maio and Salvini are expected to meet Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, to formalise the launch of the government. Once a prime minister has been nominated and ministers sworn in, the government will face a vote of confidence in the parliament. Both parties ran campaigns that vilified migrants, and Salvini has attacked Italy’s Roma population throughout his political career. It is not clear whether Italy has the legal right or resources to follow through on some of the radical ideas that were agreed, but the League vowed during the electoral campaign to institute mass deportations of asylum seekers to Africa as part of a reshaping of migration policies.Immigration experts said the new agreement meant programmes seeking to integrate new migrants could be closed. “They campaign against any positive actions or programmes, which are the very basis for any minority. This keeps them in a structurally backward position,” said Francesco Palermo, a former senator who was a vocal proponent of Romany rights in Italy. “It is more populist than racist, they feel this is what the voters want, and unfortunately average Italian society is against Roma, against migrants, against sexual minorities.”Kyenge, who now serves as an MEP, has worked for years to try to change Italy’s citizenship laws so that children of migrants can be recognised as Italians. Last year the government failed to pass a law that would have eased the path to citizenship for 800,000 minors who were born in Italy or came as young children. Kyenge said these children were unable to fully participate in schools and in society. “The identity of a person begins when you are little and it is then you must have an opportunity to say ‘I am an Italian’.”The Congolese-born doctor has lived in Italy since 1983, and has been on the receiving end of deeply offensive racist slurs. Roberto Calderoli, a senator and former minister under Silvio Berlusconi, likened her to an orangutan and told her she should be a minister “in her country”. Mario Borghezio, a far-right MEP, said Kyenge would impose a “bongo-bongo” administration on Italy – comments that led to him being expelled from a Ukip-led group in the European parliament. In 2017 a judge ordered him to pay €50,000 to Kyenge for his racist remarks.Kyenge still has bodyguards to protect her when she is in her home country, as a result of racist abuse from politicians. “People want to attack me because of the colour of my skin and many of those are politicians and it is very sad because politicians should give an example,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2423ecb94a8f246671a76b74d73ef79c12511c2/0_76_2291_1374/master/2291.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8d1607ae45ea8e1578c471d747609da","title":"venezuela election sunday nicolas maduro henri falcon","story":"Many fear dirty tricks will keep the unpopular president in power, but the opposition is urging people not to boycott Sunday’s voteAfter denouncing Venezuela’s food shortages and hyperinflation in a speech ahead of Sunday’s presidential election, the opposition candidate, Henrí Falcón, sat in his campaign bus, sucking a throat lozenge – and chewing over his predicament.Falcón ought to be the favorite. He’s up against Nicolás Maduro, the deeply unpopular and increasingly authoritarian president who is seeking another six-year term despite leading this oil-rich nation into its worst economic crisis in decades. Yet Falcón is the underdog.He’s resigned to the usual dirty tricks from the ruling Socialist Party, including the use of state food hand-outs to lure hungry people into voting for Maduro. But what most infuriates him is friendly fire: Venezuela’s largest opposition parties are denouncing Falcón as a stooge for participating in an election they say will be a sham – and which they have vowed to boycott.“This makes it a lot more complicated,” Falcón admits. “But we are going to take risks and follow the democratic path. Now is not the time for politicians to go into hiding.”Falcón has been buoyed by polls that show him either ahead or within striking distance of Maduro. He also points to research showing that even on an unfair electoral playing field, it’s almost always better to participate than to stand down. A 2009 study by the Brookings Institution of more than 100 electoral boycotts – from Afghanistan to Iraq to Peru – found that their goal of rendering elections illegitimate in the eyes of the world was rarely achieved. Instead, they left the boycotting parties in an even weaker state.Javier Corrales, a Venezuela expert at Amherst College, says that Sunday’s election presents an extremely rare opportunity for voters to remove an autocrat through peaceful means. Surrendering to Maduro, he says, “is the biggest mistake I’ve seen the opposition make in a decade.”The leaders of the largest of the 20-some parties that make up the opposition coalition claim that electoral conditions are so grossly weighted in Maduro’s favor that voting on Sunday would be pointless.Most electoral officials are Maduro loyalists who, in past elections, have turned a blind eye to vote tampering and the last-minute relocation of polling places in opposition strongholds. The government controls most TV and radio stations which transmit a constant stream of of pro-Maduro propaganda. It is also fomenting the notion that the ballot is not secret and that people who vote for the opposition will lose government jobs, public housing, and vital food handouts.Under the late Hugo Chávez, who ushered in Venezuela’s socialist revolution in 1999, a new constitution and numerous elections placed nearly all government institutions under the control of the ruling Socialist party.\u0026nbspThis concentration of power was aided by a feuding opposition which carried out ineffectual campaigns and electoral boycotts. After Chávez died of cancer in 2013, he was succeeded by Nicolás Maduro who is even less tolerant of dissent.The resulting fiscal crisis has prompted the government to print more money, which has led to hyperinflation and a collapse of the currency.\u0026nbspIt also means that the government can’t import enough food and medicine to meet demand.\u0026nbspMaduro has rejected economic reforms out of loyalty to socialism and because many government officials are allegedly getting rich off the economic distortions – through exchange rate scams and by selling scarce food on the black market.“It matters little whether this threat is real or perceived. Most people can’t afford to risk their paltry food rations to in order find out,” wrote the Caracas political blogger Emiliana Duarte. Maduro’s re-election pitch “pretty much comes down to ‘vote for me if you want food, starve if you want to make a point’”, she said.At a campaign rally in the western city of Barquisimeto, Maduro put it this way: “The Fatherland protects you and gives you everything. And you must give the Fatherland political power.”But just to make sure, the government has banned the two most popular opposition politicians – Leopoldo López who is under house arrest for inciting violence and Henrique Capriles who faces trumped-up corruption charges – from running. Those allowed on the ballot are two lesser-known figures: Falcón and televangelist Javier Bertucci, who is attracting big crowds by turning his campaign events into makeshift soup kitchens.Carlos González, an anti-government activist who heads a Venezuelan business association, says the name on the ballot doesn’t matter: “Jesus Christ could be the candidate and Maduro would still prevail because the system is set up for him to win,” he says. The opposition has taken this argument overseas, convincing the United States, the European Union and several Latin American countries to denounce the balloting as a sham.“Yes, Venezuelans want to vote. But we don’t want to legitimize the Maduro regime and the misery that he has brought to the country,” said Negal Morales, an opposition lawmaker. “To vote would be to take part in a farce.”Some critics contend that the boycott came about after the opposition was outmaneuvered by government negotiators. In discussions over electoral conditions, the opposition drew a line in the sand, demanding a neutral electoral tribunal, a postponement of the balloting until October, and the presence of international observers. After months of talks, the government conceded almost nothing. According to one observer, that left the opposition feeling obliged to save face by making good on its threat to sit out the election.“Maduro wants people to abstain,” Francisco Rodríguez, Falcón’s chief policy advisor, said. “He wants nobody to come out to vote because that’s the only election he can win. And the opposition fell into that trap.”Looking back on that outcome, Genaro Arriagada, the national director of Chile’s “no” campaign, once declared: “Even in a dictatorship, the worst mistake is to not participate.”With that in mind, Falcón has been barnstorming the country to convince people to that their votes matter. A former governor of the western state of Lara, Falcón was once a vocal supporter of the Bolivarian revolution ushered in by the late Hugo Chávez in 1999. But Falcón broke with Chávez in 2008 and has become a fierce critic of Maduro. His blunt campaign slogan is ¡Se va! – Spanish for “He’s leaving”.Speaking to a crowd in a working-class barrio in the industrial city of Valencia, Falcón called Maduro “the president of hunger and misery”. He pointed out that the average monthly salary is no longer enough to buy a carton of eggs and outlined his plan to scrap the bolívar, Venezuela’s badly devalued currency, and replace it with the US dollar.Maduro has said that he is a victim of “economic warfare” waged from Washington his critics blame the cratering economy on mismanagement. Meanwhile a steady stream of multinationals have withdrawn from Venezuela saying that currency controls and shortages make it impossible to do business in the country. This week, the breakfast cereal maker Kellogg’s announced that it was pulling out because of the “economic and social deterioration in the country.”In the crowd at Valencia, one newfound Falcón supporter, Maricarmen Vidal, said she used to work as a cleaning woman in the house of a middle-class family in Valencia. But to escape the economic meltdown, the family moved abroad and she was thrown out of work. Now, she eeks out a living selling tiny bags of sugar and coffee on a Valencia street corner. Vidal says about the only thing she knows about Falcón is that he’s not Maduro – “but that’s enough.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3269547a7c15387881c41f5ddc23fd209ec68957/69_0_2063_1238/master/2063.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02e3c59c0618af81f9e784f5627a3137","title":"china says air force lands bombers on south china sea islands","story":"Exercise described by air force as preparation for ‘the battle’ for the disputed waters China’s air force has landed bombers on islands and reefs in the South China Sea as part of a training exercise in the disputed region, it said in a statement.Several bombers of various types – including the long-range, nuclear strike-capable H-6K – carried out landing and take off drills at an unidentified island airfield after carrying out simulated strike training on targets at sea, the Chinese airforce said.“A ision of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) recently organised multiple bombers such as the H-6K to conduct take-off and landing training on islands and reefs in the South China Sea in order to improve our ability to ‘reach all territory, conduct strikes at any time and strike in all directions’,” it said.The statement said the pilot of the H-6K bomber conducted assault training on a designated sea target and then carried out take-offs and landings at an airport in the area, describing the exercise as preparation for “the west Pacific and the battle for the South China Sea”. The notice, published on the PLAAF’s Weibo microblogging account, did not provide the precise location of the exercise. The US has dispatched warships to disputed areas of the South China Sea in a bid to challenge China’s extensive sovereignty claims in the territory, which is also subject to claims by Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei and Malaysia. The waters are vital global shipping routes and contain what are believed to be significant oil and natural gas deposits.“The United States remains committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Pentagon spokesman Lt Col Christopher Logan said. “We have seen these same reports and China’s continued militarisation of disputed features in the South China Sea only serves to raise tensions and destabilise the region.” Wang Mingliang, a defence expert cited in the Chinese statement, said the takeoff and landing exercises will help the air force “strengthen its combat capability to deal with maritime security threats”.The move comes weeks after US network CNBC reported that China had installed anti-ship and air-to-air defences on outposts in the Spratly Islands that are also claimed by Vietnam and the Philippines, citing sources close to US intelligence.Washington warned Beijing would face unspecified “consequences” over its militarisation of the South China Sea, and said it had raised the issue with China.In an analysis published on its website, CSIS said the location of the runway was believed to be Woody Island, China’s largest base in the Paracel Islands, which is also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan.China has engaged in years of land-reclamation efforts on reefs it controls in the region and built both civilian and military facilities in the contested area.Chinese military facilities include air bases, radar and communications systems, naval facilities and defensive weaponry including landing strips able to accommodate military planes.Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54c14350da8d726c795bcd8d4ed933775707153f/0_1969_3983_2390/master/3983.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc2c94653984f9495b13d44d2b475244","title":"exposed how to disappear from the internet","story":"Worried about what’s out there about you? You’re not alone. But is it even possible to become a digital ghost?Early one morning last year, before the birds were up, Tio Bucard, his wife and children skittered down the path from their home in a tiny French village towards a black SUV, its engine running. As Bucard drove to the local airport, he checked his rear-view mirror every few moments to see that he was still being followed by Frank Ahearn, a 54-year-old American with a peppery beard and wraparound sunglasses. Bucard (not his real name) had met Ahearn for the first time only the day before, in the lobby of a Monaco hotel close to Bucard’s office. Now he had entrusted his family’s safety to this former drug addict from the Bronx. Bucard pulled into the airport’s long-term car park. Then he and the family transferred into Ahearn’s hired SUV. As they pulled on to the motorway, Ahearn joked whether, while the family was in hiding, he could look after Bucard’s £5,000 watch, a Bentley Flying B No 3.The watch was a reminder of more plentiful times. Bucard, who raised capital for a private equity firm, had recently found himself on the wrong end of a bad deal. Problems gathered and the firm began to default on payments. One of the slighted investors had, as Bucard puts it, “a shady past” and angry phone calls soon blackened into threats of physical violence. Fearing for his and his family’s safety, Bucard typed the phrase “how to disappear” into Google. Halfway down the first page of results, he saw Ahearn’s name. A former New York skip tracer – a private investigator who finds people who have “skipped” town – turned professional “disappearer”, Ahearn offers a range of freelance services, everything from helping to restore your privacy on the internet to driving your family across Europe and into a new life.“My idea was to go away for three to four months,” Bucard tells me. “Just until I could raise the funds to pay back my investors.” Not wanting to cause alarm, Bucard told his children they were taking an extended vacation. The day before they fled, Ahearn rented an Airbnb in a far-flung city in his name. When the family arrived at the safe house, Ahearn bought new mobile phones and laptops, then schooled the family on the rules of their new life: do use untraceable text-messaging services don’t use public email servers do pay in cash don’t use Facebook. After a few days, Ahearn left the Bucards in their temporary accommodation and returned to his home in Madrid, where he lives with his girlfriend. In his wallet, he carried Bucard’s credit card.When he landed in Spain, Ahearn tried to imagine what a man of Bucard’s wealth might indulge in while on holiday. Then he began a riot of spending: fine clothes, meals out, a king’s ransom of trinkets. “I had a blast with his plastic,” he says. “And that, my friend, is how to leave a trail of super-cool disinformation.”Money, violence, indiscretion: the motivation for any person who wants to disappear, either physically or digitally, usually wends back to one of these. Whatever the reason and whatever the scale of the ambition – from starting a new life in a foreign country to scrubbing one’s name and address from the phonebook – it has never been harder to vanish. In a world where almost any action outside your garden shed leaves some kind of digital footprint, there is no clear path back to the realm of the unknown.In recent months, the scale of the erosion of our anonymity has become dauntingly clear. In humming, ice-cooled server farms, the monoliths of Silicon Valley gather fat troves of personal information. This much we have known for years – as early as 2010, an investigation found that Facebook apps were routinely collecting information for internet-tracking companies without our consent – even from private accounts. But the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal brought new clarity. Those who downloaded their personal data files found that Facebook and its associated apps had been tracking phone calls, reading messages and plundering phonebooks.This gleeful, grasping attitude to our data is in the social network’s DNA. This year it was revealed that in 2004, while Facebook was still a university campus website on which male students could rate the attractiveness of female students, its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, sent an instant message to a friend in which he boasted that he had collected more than 4,000 emails, pictures and addresses of people who had signed up to the service.“What?” Zuckerberg’s friend exclaimed. “How’d you manage that one?”“People just submitted it,” Zuckerberg wrote. “I don’t know why. They ‘trust me’.”“Dumb fucks,” he added, after a pause.Facebook is not the only harvester of personal information. If Google is the engine that drives the internet, personal information is the oil that makes it purr. Via its Maps app, it knows where you’ve been, how you got there (foot, car, bus, train), how long you stayed and whether or not it was your first visit. The company stores your search history across every device on which you’re logged in, while algorithms reportedly scour your emails for signs that you might be pregnant, engaged or unwell. Google Lens, announced earlier this month, is a visual search engine that provides information about the things you’re looking at through your phone’s camera. Google likely knows your age, gender, hobbies, career, interests, relationship status, every YouTube video you’ve watched, every image you’ve searched for, whether or not you’re depressed and, possibly, even why you’re depressed before you do – and it’s far from the only omniscient god in the digital pantheon. What began as a hopeful, democratic mission to make the internet free for all in the 1990s has, when fed through the late capitalist mincer, resulted in a digital economy that runs on microtransactions of identity. This information, if held by a government, would inspire widespread civil liberty marches.For most of us, the quality and convenience of what we receive in exchange for our secrets is enough that we willingly surrender. But now an increasing number of people are more closely counting the cost – to the point of trying to reclaim our right to be unknown. It’s become a challenge: the woman fleeing an abusive relationship, the elderly victim of identity theft, the stalked celebrity, the school leaver who’s sabotaged their job search with old, embarrassing YouTube videos, already knows just how difficult that can be.When Ahearn finished rehab, aged 17, he had quit pills but was left newly directionless. He took a stopgap job in a New York shoe store. Then, when it closed down, he responded to an advertisement for a private investigator. The job was glamour-less, but Ahearn found it intoxicating nonetheless. He was hired to pose as a stockroom worker for high-end New York stores and catch co-workers stealing the merchandise. He caught 15 employees stealing from one department store, and later busted a 30-man criminal ring at an electronics and furniture warehouse. “Manipulation,” he says. “It’s the first thing I was ever really good at.”Carry out a self-styled “before” audit to see what’s out there. Search for yourself with all name variations, email addresses and residential addresses. You could be shocked by what you find.\u0026nbspAll active accounts must be deleted – not deactivated – if you want to use the internet untraceably. Facebook, Amazon, eBay, Netflix, Tinder: they all have to go. It can be difficult to remember every site you have signed up for, so look in your email inbox for newsletters. Unsubscribe and ask to be removed from their data list the new GDPR update on 25 May 2018 means that sites are legally obliged to do this on request.It’s highly likely that personal data such as home address, email and even your date of birth is being publicly shared online by so-called data broker websites, such as 192. Ask for this information to be removed directly from the site, and they should comply.If you’ve posted on web forums, you can ask the webmasters to remove your posting. If they prove unresponsive, and data brokers or social media companies fail to remove your information on request, then exercise the “right to be forgotten” by a direct request to Google (search for legal removal request).Unfortunately, once removed does not mean for ever removed on the internet. You should actively audit yourself every six months and some of the steps may have to be repeated. And if you can’t quite make all the necessary sacrifices, consider setting up a false email address with inaccurate data, amending personal details such as age, sex, name and location.After a while, the private detective agency allowed Ahearn to work in the office. There he sat next to a skip tracer. “Skip-tracing is the art of finding people,” he explains. “There are two types of skip tracer: passive ones, who use databases and directories to find people and aggressive ones, who carry out social engineering to find their prey.” Ahearn would listen as his colleague extracted information about someone by calling utility companies and posing as the target in order to gain access to their phone records and bank details until, finally, he zoned in on a likely hideout address. Ahearn convinced his boss to give him a go. “I was like wildfire,” he recalls. “A natural.”In 1984, Ahearn left the detective agency and set up as a freelance skip tracer. For a while, business boomed. He would occasionally take short breaks (“Sometimes being so good at something so devious plays on the head”), but then crisis dawned when the laws in America changed, making many of the skip tracers’ techniques illegal. “Life became more difficult,” he recalls. Ahearn moved to Europe, where the laws were less stringent, and then, in the late 1990s, the pendulum swung back. The omnipresence of the mobile phone made it far easier to track iniduals, and the creeping ubiquity of social media ushered in a new golden era for the investigator. “I can find you through your mother’s Facebook, a blog you wrote three years ago, an old LinkedIn account,” Ahearn says.In 2001, he placed an advertisement on a website that provided advice about offshore living. When the website’s owner pointed out that Ahearn’s work finding people might concern its users, who, in many cases, prized anonymity, Ahearn suggested that he write a blogpost on how to disappear instead. “It was a really cheesy article, but it just blew up,” Ahearn recalls. “People from all over the world started contacting me.” Once he had weeded out those iniduals looking for an aider and abetter (“If you’re facing law enforcement, I cannot help you I also stay away from sexual issues”), Ahearn took on his first client: a woman who wanted to escape from her violent partner. “She didn’t want a new identity, just to move away and be sure that the husband couldn’t find her,” he says.In the past 15 years, the techniques Ahearn uses to ghost a client have grown in scope and sophistication. But unlike reputation management companies, which typically try to drive harmful or revealing information down search engine results, he favours the use of misinformation – and not just via misdirecting credit card transactions in a foreign city. “You can’t delete information,” he says. “It’s not going away. It’s a case of manipulating what is already out there.”If Ahearn is the special forces of the vanishment industry, brought in for the most extreme jobs, a sparse, open-plan office on the outskirts of Liverpool is home to the foot soldiers of this burgeoning industry. Here, at Reputation Defender, a team of 30 or so young men and women scour the internet for personal information – phone numbers, dates of birth, addresses, electoral records – that their clients want removed from the internet.Managing director Tony McChrystal began working in online privacy and reputation management before there was a name for the industry. In 2008, when he joined the company, then known as Reputation 247, as one of its first employees, it had just five clients. “We were living hand to mouth, you know, never sure whether we were going to be able to open the doors the following month,” he says. Today, the company is one of the largest in its field McChrystal claims that the UK office receives 70 inquiries a day, mostly from iniduals who want to become unknown on the internet. To date, the company has served more than a million clients worldwide, and last month it was bought by the Washington-based Stagwell Group for an undisclosed sum.In the early years, McChrystal’s clients were typically celebrities, footballers and CEOs: people who wanted specific pieces of professionally damaging information about them – an affair, a failed business deal – pushed down the search engine rankings. In recent years, however, he says that the company mainly works with the kind of “regular” people who might pay for their credit file report every month, and who want a similar reputation or privacy report. For around £600 a year, the company will give you a list of what personal or sensitive information is publicly available. “A lot of the time, they’re scared of identity theft, fraud or even – if their current address is out there – scared of their own personal safety,” McChrystal says. It is surprisingly easy for a criminal to use social media to plan a burglary. “One of our clients’ daughter was on holiday in France recently at the family villa, and she posted geo-tagged pictures on Instagram of the villa alongside pictures of her and her friends wearing expensive jewellery and watches,” McChrystal explains. Within 24 hours of posting, there was a home invasion at the villa and half a million dollars’ worth of jewellery was stolen. “After that, we had to go in and talk about how to manage their privacy settings on their Instagram and Facebook.”Like Ahearn, McChrystal and his team screen the motivations of potential clients. “We probably get two paedophiles call up every day,” he admits. This kind of inidual, McChrystal says, will typically claim they are the victim of mistaken identity: someone who shares their name has been accused of something awful. “That kind of thing actually doesn’t happen very often, so we tell them we will have to carry out a police check, and that’s when the conversation breaks down.” Team members refer to a “Who we serve” document, drawn up by the company’s lawyers, which forbids working with criminals who have been convicted of “anything above a misdemeanour”, as well as fraudsters and those who have been accused of sexual misconduct. “It’s not even up for debate. If you were found guilty of physical abuse, that’s relevant information to me. It shouldn’t be forgotten, you know?”Google agrees. In 2014, the European court of justice ruled that “irrelevant” and outdated data should be erased on request. In the past four years, the company has received more than 600,000 requests (many of which were submitted by the team at Reputation Defender on behalf of its clients) to delist nearly 2.4m results from the search engine. In many cases, Google has successfully argued that the information is in the public interest and that the petitioner does not have the right to be forgotten.In the past two years, however, McChrystal, who deleted his own Facebook account some time ago, has seen a marked increase in approaches from iniduals who are not in danger or want a piece of damaging information covered up, but who simply want to reclaim their anonymity.Emma Jones approached the team last year after one of her closest friends was the victim of identity theft. When Jones Googled herself, she found her name and address posted to various directory sites. “I wasn’t comfortable with my data being on the internet and there being nothing I could do about it,” she says. “I’ve got a young family. I felt exposed.” McChrystal’s team put together a dossier showing all the information on her and her family that was available online, alongside a proposal for how it might be removed or, in the case of social media sites, made private. Jones, who works in marketing, represents a new kind of client: one without a specific privacy problem who has become sufficiently unnerved by recent data breaches that she is willing to spend hundreds of pounds hiring professionals to restore her anonymity.Like many people, she once used Facebook as a way of keeping a record of family life. “I’d upload photos of my children every day. I didn’t care whether or not my friends found them interesting. Now I rarely post pictures of my children – maybe the backs of their heads, but that’s it. It should be their choice, not mine. If my daughter comes to me when she is older and asks me why I put all those photos of her on the internet, I have no comeback.”In recent weeks, a grassroots movement has formed around the slogan Delete Facebook (Zuckerberg claims it has been a failure). For Meg Jayanth, a writer for video games, the Cambridge Analytica scandal pushed her willingly into Facebook oblivion. “I’d been considering deleting Facebook for at least a year, but my data anxieties were outweighed by convenience,” she told me. “Facebook was the way I stayed in touch with friends and family, and I was reluctant to leave it behind. The Cambridge Analytica news tipped the balance for me, not because it was unexpected, but because it forced me to stop rationalising away my use of the service, and act. I was sick of feeling apprehensive for using a service I didn’t even want to use any more.”The process of deleting one’s Facebook account is deliberately arcane. The social network encourages you to “deactivate” your account, rather than “delete” it, to leave an open door if you later regret the decision. Permanent deletion requires a request be made to the company. If you log in within 14 days of the process being under way (easy to do accidentally if you have the app on your phone or linked accounts that require you to log in via Facebook), the company will automatically cancel your original request.For Jayanth, who holds an Indian passport, the recent news that the US state department is asking visa applicants to declare their social media accounts on their forms was a further incentive. “The idea that customs officials might look through your social media, and could potentially make decisions based on whether or not you support the current government is dangerous. That could have a chilling effect on public debate.”Tio Bucard’s experience last year was enough to force a more thorough evaluation of his family’s privacy and safety. They never returned to their house in the French village.“This is something that happens to many of my clients,” Ahearn says. “Disappearing is a trigger that wakes a person up and makes one think carefully about what is next.”Ahearn founded a few offshore companies for Bucard, helping him buy a new house, cars and other essentials. He set the family up with a communications protocol, so they could keep in touch with family and business associates. Bucard and his wife decided to take the children out of the French education system and home school them. They took out private medical insurance to remove their names from the health system. To maintain a life of anonymity is an ongoing act of obsession, a symptom of which is often paranoia. Bucard has kept Ahearn on retainer whenever a new client comes his way, Ahearn runs checks on the person, to make sure they are who they say they are, and not connected in some way to his previous life.Complete invisibility is an impossible goal for anyone outside a witness protection programme (“The creme de la creme,” as Ahearn puts it. “If you have that, you have everything”), even for those who have never signed up for a social media or Google account. In Britain, unless you opt out when registering to vote, your data is collected and made available to anyone who wants to buy a copy.“People see the digital realm as being this separate thing, something close to unreal,” Ahearn says. “But it’s all the same thing. Would you put a picture of your child on a billboard next to a highway alongside your family name? Of course not. But people do it online all the time. And it’s not a problem. Until it is.”Some names have been changed• Commenting on this piece?

Any breeze from the sea – which is usual – bounces up the slope to let a kestrel hover there with spread wings and least effort: perhaps it has a wind-map in its mind of these things.“Windhover” is an old name for Falco tinnunculus (falco being the Latin for sickle, the shape of the wings, and tinnunculus for jingling, as of a bell and onomatopoeic for the kestrel’s rare cry). It is also a name I love, surviving the ecstatic densities of Gerard Manley Hopkins’s much-parsed poem. Pursuing the word’s history online brought me to a lively row over two supposedly ancient alternatives in historic English usage: “windfucker” and “windsucker”. The first is advanced in an online dictionary compiled by an American sociologist and author Douglas Harper (Online Etymology Dictionary, 2001-2018). A criticism that the elongated “s” of old manuscripts has simply been misread has prompted vigorous and erudite exchanges (see Wiktionary: Talk: windfucker).The current balance of the argument seems to be that both words have sound provenance, with the “f” word in use as synonym for “beat” or “strike” – something vigorous, anyway – in the 16th and 17th centuries, and the other as having local usage from Kent to Orkney. Of much more interest scientifically has been a Finnish study in the 1990s, which showed the hovering kestrel’s ability to track voles on the ground below through ultraviolet (UV) reflections from the urine and faeces the rodents use to scent-mark their runways.In northern Europe, and notably in Scandinavia, there are broadly four-year cycles of change that synchronise crashes in the vole population with kestrel migrations over hundreds of square kilometres. When this happens, how do the birds seek out the most promising concentrations of voles?The Finnish researchers used captive kestrels in laboratory experiments to show that they detected vole scent marks in UV light but not in visible light. Then they moved out into field trials over some 100sq km of level farmland.They ided this into areas with and without artificial vole trails of urine and faeces, and without trails at all, and distributed kestrel nesting boxes between them, 15 to each. They watched the foraging, mostly male birds for 24 mornings as they hunted near the boxes the following spring and charted their special attention to the areas with artificial scent trails.Ireland had no voles until the bank vole, Myodes variolus, arrived in the 1920s with German earth-moving machinery brought in through Foynes to build the Shannon dam at Ardnacrusha. They now extend through nearly half the island, mostly in the south and west.Another alien invader, the greater white-toothed shrew, was discovered in 2008, its little bones showing up in disgorged pellets of kestrels and barn owls in Tipperary and Limerick. The shrew is thought to have arrived en famille in the root ball of a big plant imported to an Irish garden centre now, advancing at some 5km a year, it is colonising seven counties.Ireland has been poor in small mammal species, but the two newcomers have threatened those we have, and notably the native field mouse and pygmy shrew. The latter is disappearing altogether where both aliens are present.Such changes have brought what has been called “an invasional meltdown” to the ecosystems of hedgerow and grassland. And for raptors like kestrel and barn owl, it offers a change of diet.Dr Pat Smiddy, an ornithologist and conservation ranger, decided to take some measure of change by analysing kestrel pellets across 650sq km of east Co Cork and west Co Waterford – farmland within the aliens’ known territory. From nest sites in old and ruined buildings, many of which he knew, he collected 1,057 of the pellets.Teased apart for significant bones, every site yielded bits of bank voles, especially where the greater white-toothed shrew was also present. The pygmy shrew turned up mostly where the bigger shrew was absent and never where both aliens live together. Field and house mice and brown rat – traditional kestrel prey – were low in the percentage of remains.This research into Irish kestrel diet, the most comprehensive so far, shows how important the alien mammals have become for birds of prey and the impact of their competition with native furry species. Our birds of prey are changing too, as red kite, golden and white-tailed eagles have been introduced as apex predators, so that a whole new wildlife scenario heads into the problems of climate change.Dr Smiddy’s study is published in the Biology and Environment journal of the Royal Irish Academy.

Photograph: Jane BarlowPA WirePool via ReutersThere was red, white and blue bunting as far as the eye could see on Belfast’s Shankill Road as the community gathered to celebrate the royal wedding of Britain’s Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.Hundreds of people were at the Community First royal wedding party at the Linfield Supporters Club in Jumna Street on Saturday for a street party and live screening of the nuptials. Outside the venue families waving union flags basked in the glorious sunshine.While the adults chatted, ate burgers and enjoyed the weather little ones were jumping up and down on bouncy castles, having their faces painted and tucking into union flag party bags full of sweets and treats.Margaret McCauley and her daughter Anichelle posted for pictures by life-size cardboard cut outs of Harry and Meghan which were flanked by giant balloons emblazoned with ‘Shankill Road celebrates Harry Meghan 19-5-2018’. Melissa Faulkner, at the party with her children Luca and Albie, described the day as “once in a lifetime”.“Meghan is lovely,” she said.“It is nice to have somebody different in the royal family and it’s good to celebrate and keep our tradition by bringing a bit of Britain over here.”Harry and Meghan have been given the titles of Duke and Duchess of Sussex, with Harry also now known as the Baron of Kilkeel, after the Co Down fishing town. Community First organiser Charlie Butler, also manager of the Linfield Supporters Club, said locals wanted to celebrate the couple and he was thrilled to welcome such a “beautiful wee girl” as Meghan into the royal family. “It is really good to see the royal family ersify,” he said. “Absolutely brilliant.”Former Lord Mayor of Belfast Brian Kingston, a DUP councillor, praised Community First and said Meghan was “a wonderful addition to the royal family”.“It will be another generation before we have this same level of royal wedding,” he said. “It is lovely to see the community coming together to enjoy the day.”Inside the club groups of women had arrived early to secure seats in front of the big screen televising the wedding coverage and service. Lyndsey Hanna is mega Meghan fan. “I love Meghan,” she said. “She’s so down to earth.”Lisa Glass, who had dressed five-month-old baby daughter Lillie in a royal themed outfit complete with union flag tutu, said the party would be a memory to look back on. “We will remember it forever,” she said.Donna Bates spoke of her joy at the community celebrating together “in good times instead of bad times”.Street parties were organised in locations across the North with a range of hotels and venues running special royal wedding themed parties.The excitement on the Shankill was shared in the city centre at the Europa Hotel, where manager James McGinn cut a dashing figure in his morning suit, as he and the Hastings team ensured a sold-out royal afternoon tea ran smoothly in the piano lounge and restaurant.“Even I got out of my bed and into my grey morning suit and yellow tie,” James said.“We have had people queuing from 10am to get the best seats.”Fizz and tea were served with sandwiches, scones and pastries, plus a special lemon and elderflower cake, similar to that chosen by the royal couple for their day. Julie Ann Kennedy from Aghalee, Co Antrim, brought her family to the event. “It’s a lovely girls afternoon out,” she said. “Meghan is an absolutely beautiful princess. The service was beautiful, very different but lovely. Meghan and Harry will help modernise the royal family for generations to come.”Cathy Wicks from Waringstown, Co Down, was at the Europa with her two sisters, her mother and her mother’s two sisters. “We love the royal family,” she said. “I think Meghan looks stunning and Harry looks dashing as ever.”Cathy’s sister Jayne Jackson thinks the royal couple are doing important work in society. “I like all the charity work they do, especially the mental health work,” she said. “It is a really important message for the royal family to use their popularity to make a difference.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3500738.1526712296!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar backed 12 week proposal ahead of committee report","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn publicly announcing his position last January, Leo Varadkar said he had to think “long and hard” about supporting the committee’s proposals.  Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he came to his own conclusion on how Ireland’s abortion laws should be reformed in advance of the Oireachtas committee which shaped the Government’s own proposals.Mr Varadkar largely kept his counsel as the committee conducted his work, and for weeks after it issued its report in December.However, he said on Friday he had reached the same conclusion as the Oireachtas body in advance but independently of the committee process which began in April 2017.The committee recommended the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution should be repealed and to permit abortion without restrictions for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Mr Varadkar has said legislation would be introduced along these lines if the referendum passes next Friday.The Citizens’ Assembly, which laid the ground for the Oireachtas committee, had also recommended the introduction of abortion without restriction for the first 12 weeks.“I wanted to make sure we had a proper, deliberative process,” the Taoiseach told the Don’t Stop Repealin’ podcast, citing the Citizens’ Assembly and the Oireachtas committee.“It was only after that work was done that I really wanted to let people know about the conclusions about that I had come to as well, which was very much in line with that. I think if I had announced where I was heading earlier I might have been accused of trying to influence or put pressure on members of the all-party committee, which I didn’t do.“Having studied the facts, they came to a similar view as I did, very much independently.”In publicly announcing his position last January, Mr Varadkar said he had to think “long and hard” about supporting the committee’s proposals.“In making my decision to support it, I listened to the views of others – medical experts, the public, my party and Ministers, friends. Above all, I listened to women. I had to think long and hard about the provision for abortion without a specific indication in the first 12 weeks.”“The Taoiseach’s own views were formed over a period of time. There is no particular day on which they crystallised. He was very much informed by the views of the Citizens’ Assembly, the views of the party, the public, and the all-party committee. The most important thing is that next Friday, the Irish people will have their say on an issue of crucial importance for women. It’s a once in a generation decision.”Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3500508.1526664501!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexiteers resist theresa may s proposals for customs alignment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May: Labour’s shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd said the proposal was no more than a temporary measure which was an inadequate response to the issue of the Border. Photograph: Andrew YatesGetty ImagesTheresa May’s plan to keep Britain aligned with the EU customs union after the end of a post-Brexit transition period has run into resistance from Conservative backbenchers, with former party leader Iain Duncan Smith warning that it should not last more than a month or two.The cabinet agreed this week that the whole of the United Kingdom could remain linked to the customs union beyond the end of 2020 if trade negotiations failed to find a solution that would keep the Irish Border open.Mr Duncan Smith said Brexiteers could accept such a move but only if it was very strictly limited in duration and he warned against agreeing to an extension at this stage in the negotiations.“If they do require to have some kind of backstop, most people will accept that on the basis that it is there for practical reasons but that it is not in any way about the politics, it is wholly about the practicalities,” he told the BBC.“Pre-announcing an extension would be barking mad – you would send a signal to the EU that we don’t know what we want.”Labour’s shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd said the prime minister’s proposal, which she has yet to outline in detail, was no more than a temporary measure which was an inadequate response to the issue of the Border.“If I was an investor looking to invest in my own constituency here in Rochdale, or for that matter anywhere across Northern Ireland, I’d want a bit more certainty about how long this is going to last,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We’ve got to have some real fleshing-out, because no hard border is not just for 2019, 2020, it’s got to be into the long future.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said this week that a plan for customs would not be enough to resolve the Border issue, which would require Britain to retain close ties to the single market too. EU negotiators are sceptical about a customs-only solution, pointing out that border checks would still be needed for regulatory purposes.\u0026nbspBrussels has also made clear that its proposed backstop for Northern Ireland, which would see the North effectively remain in parts of the single market, will not be available to the whole of the UK.Brexiteers on the Conservative backbenches are adamant that Britain must not maintain regulatory alignment for goods with the EU after Brexit and that the country must be free to negotiate new, independent trade deals as soon as possible.Following 15 defeats in the House of Lords on the EU Withdrawal Bill, Ms May has nominated nine new Conservative life peers, including a number of former MPs. Since most of the amendments opposed by the government were passed with majorities numbered in the dozens, the appointments will not make a decisive difference to the arithmetic in the upper house.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn nominated three life peers and DUP leader in Westminster Nigel Dodds nominated former mid-Ulster MP William McCrea.\u0026nbspNegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3501664.1526731076!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"prince harry and meghan markle marry at windsor castle","story":"Britain\u0027s Prince Harry has married American actress Meghan Markle in a lavish ceremony at Windsor Castle.

Photograph: Chris JacksonAFPGetty ImagesBritain’s Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle were pronounced husband and wife on Saturday by the Archbishop of Canterbury in a glittering union that brought a measure of modern Hollywood glamour into the 1,000-year-old monarchy.The star of the TV drama Suits walked unescorted in a pure white, long-sleeved dress to the middle of the 15th-century St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle, where the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, accompanied her towards his son, waiting at the altar.After exchanging vows to love and to cherish “till death us do part”, Prince Harry (33), sixth-in-line to the British throne, placed a ring of Welsh gold on Markle’s finger before a congregation including Queen Elizabeth, senior royals, and celebrities including US media mogul Oprah Winfrey.“In the presence of God, and before this congregation, Harry and Meghan have given their consent and made their marriage vows to each other,” Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby intoned.“They have declared their marriage by the joining of hands and by the giving and receiving of rings. I therefore proclaim that they are husband and wife.”The marriage brings Markle, three years older than Harry and born and raised in Los Angeles, into one of the world’s grandest royal families.While the ceremony incorporated the traditions of a monarchy that traces its history back to 1066, Markle brought a sense of modernity.She did not vow to obey her husband Harry, unlike other senior male royals, will wear a wedding ring Markle’s father was unable to attend due to reported heart surgery and a black U.S. Episcopalian bishop, Michael Bruce Curry, gave an impassioned wedding address on the “feeling-bomb” of love, quoting black US civil rights leader Martin Luther King.“When love is the way, we actually treat each other like we are actually family,” he said.Tens of thousands of fans lined the route Markle took towards the castle, waving British flags and cheering as her Rolls-Royce limousine drove past.Air traffic controllers for the nearby Heathrow Airport, one of the world’s busiest, closed the airspace over Windsor for the 15 minutes before the ceremony.Hours before, Queen Elizabeth had bestowed the title of Duke of Sussex on her grandson, a step that meant Markle became a duchess when she married Harry.Sunshine and bearskinsUnder clear skies and glorious sunshine, a military band in scarlet uniforms and bearskin hats entertained excited fans gathered behind barriers. Police armed with semi-automatic rifles patrolling streets and watching from rooftops.Among celebrity guests, American actor George Clooney and his wife Amal were joined by former soccer star David Beckham, his fashion designer wife Victoria and James Corden, British host of the American TV chat show The Late Late Show.Other guests included tennis ace Serena Williams, the siblings of Harry’s late mother Princess Diana, singer Elton John, who sang at Diana’s 1997 funeral, British actor Idris Elba, and two of Harry’s ex-girlfriends.The chapel was adorned with white roses, Diana’s favourite flowers.“This is a moment when we can all celebrate the rebirth of the royal family,” said Kenny McKinlay, 60, who had come down from Scotland for the wedding. “It’s a time when all the nation can come together rather than being ided. It’s a day when you can be proud to be British.”The royal couple, who met on a blind date in 2016 and fell in love in a tent under the stars in Botswana, tied the knot in a castle that has been home to 39 English monarchs since 1066.Tens of thousands of fans crammed the narrow roads of Windsor, about 30 km west of London. Visitors had to pass through police search points set up around the castle.Father not presentMarkle’s own father Thomas Markle (73), a former lighting director for TV soaps and sitcoms, pulled out of the ceremony this week, telling the US celebrity website TMZ he had had heart surgery on Wednesday.Confusion over his attendance marred the build-up to the wedding, which had been choreographed for months by royal aides, and his name still appears in the order of service.The service was conducted by the Dean of Windsor with Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury and spiritual head of the Anglican Church, overseeing the exchange of vows.A black US Episcopalian bishop, Michael Bruce Curry, gave the wedding address, while Lady Jane Fellowes, Diana’s sister, delivered the reading.Prime minister Theresa May, who along with other politicians was not invited to the wedding, sent good wishes to the couple, adding: “To all of those joining the national celebration with street parties and other events, have a wonderful day.”In among traditional hymns, a choir performed American soul singer Ben E. King’s 1960s hit Stand by me.After the ceremony, the newlyweds are expected to greet some of the 1,200 members of the public invited into the castle grounds before starting a carriage procession through Windsor.A reception will be held in the castle’s St George’s Hall before 200 guests join the couple at an evening event at the nearby Frogmore House mansion.The couple will carry out their first official engagement as husband and wife next week. -

Mozart probably wrote his Piano Concerto no 18 for her. She became blind at an early age but that didn’t stop her musical career. This piece probably isn’t by her – it was probably by the 20 th century violinist Samuel Dushkin. This song has been endlessly re-arranged. It’s the single most popular song by this late 19th – early 20th century composer. It sounds like a piece of Latin church music, but in fact it’s one a set of songs Schubert composed in 1825, all based on poems in Sir Walter Scott’s epic ‘The Lady of the Lake’.

It became massively popular and could have earned him a fortune.Holst taught at St Paul’s School for Girls and composed this in 1912 for the school orchestra. This movement based on 16 th century English balladParry, a leading light of the so-called ‘English Renaissance’ who was the first director of the Royal College of Music in 1883. He wrote his Lady Radnor’s suite in 1894 for the all-women orchestra conducted by Helen, Countess of Radnor. It’s a kind of Baroque Suite in Victorian dress.Set of dances based on a book of Renaissance dances composed by Peter Warlock (gifted composer who died in 1930 aged 36).Vaughan Williams was a collector of folk-song, and wrote many pieces based on the songs he found. This one is especially beloved, it’s always in Classic FM’s Hall of Fame. More famous and well-known than the tune it’s based on.Elgar’s first really successful work, completed in 1893. It remained one of his favourite works right to the end of his life. He liked it because it was ‘really stringy’ – weird phrase but a musician knows What he means – it completely suits a string orchestra, you couldn’t arrange it for something else.In his early days, Elgar was always complaining about having no money, and wrote this delicious piece in 1899 as a deliberate money-spinner for his publisher Novello.

Let’s call this place the West. These lands had once been ravaged by bloody wars but its rulers had, since, solved the puzzle of perpetual progress and discovered a kind of political and economic elixir of life. Big Problems were relegated to either Somewhere Else (the East) or Another Time (History). The Westerners dutifully sent emissaries far and wide to spread the word that the secret of eternal bliss had been found –and were, themselves, to live happily ever after. So ran, until very recently, the story of how the West was won. The formula that had been discovered was simple: the recipe for a bright, shiny new brand of global capitalism based on liberal democracy and something called neoclassical economics . But it was different from previous eras – cleansed of Dickensian grime. The period after the two world wars was in many a Golden Age: the moment of Bretton Woods (that established the international monetary and financial order) and the Beveridge report (the blueprint for the welfare state), feminism and free love.It was post-colonial, post-racial, post-gendered. It felt like you could have it all, material abundance and the moral revolutions a world infinitely vulnerable to invention – but all without picking sides, all based on institutional equality of access. That’s how clever the scheme was – truly a brave new world. Fascism and class, slavery and genocide – no one doubted that, in the main, it had been left behind (or at least that we could all agree on its evils) that the wheels of history had permanently been set in motion to propel us towards a better future. The end of history, Francis Fukuyama called it – the zenith of human civilisation. Austerity in Athens: the eurozone crisis hit Greece not once but twice (Getty)While liberal democracy was the part of the programme that got slapped on to the brochure, it was a streamlined paradigm of neoclassical economics that provided the brains behind the enterprise. Neoclassical economics, scarred by war-era ideological acrimony, scrubbed the subject of all the messy stuff: politics, values – all the fluff. To do so it used a new secret weapon: quantitative precision unprecedented in the social sciences.It didn’t rest on whimsical things like enlightened leadership or invested citizenship or compassionate communities. No, siree. It was pure science: a reliable, universally-applicable maximising equation for society (largely stripped of any contextual or, until recently, even cognitive considerations). Its particular magic trick was to be able to do good without requiring anyone to be good.And, it was limitless in its capacity to turn boundless inidual rationality into endless material wellbeing, to cull out of infinite resources (on a global scale) indefinite global growth. It presumed to definitively replace faltering human touch with the infallible “invisible hand” and, so, discourses of exploitation with those of merit. When I started as a graduate student in the early 2000s, this model was at the peak of its powers: organised into an intellectual and policy assembly line that more or less ran the world. At the heart of this enterprise, in the unipolar post-Cold War order, was what was known as the Chicago school of law and economics. The Chicago school boiled the message of neoclassical economics down to a simpler formula still: the American Dream available for export – just add private property and enforceable contracts. Anointed with a record number of Nobel prizes, its message went straight to the heart of Washington DC, and from there – via its apostles, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank radiated out to the rest of the globe. Now the world is ready to embrace MarxismIt was like the social equivalent of the Genome project. Sure the model required the odd tweak, the ironing out of the occasional glitch but, for the most part, the code had been cracked. So, like the ladies who lunch, scholarly attention in the West turned increasingly to good works and the fates of “the other” – spatially and temporally. One strain led to a thriving industry in development: these were the glory days of tough love, and loan conditionalities. The message was clear: if you want Western-style growth, get with the programme. The polite term for it was structural adjustment and good governance: a strict regime of purging what Max Weber had called mysticism and magic, and swapping it for muscular modernisation. Titles like Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson’s Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity and Poverty and Hernando de Soto’s The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism  Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else jostled for space on shelves of bookstores and best-seller lists. Another led to esoteric islands of scholarship devoted to atonement for past sins. On the US side of the Atlantic, post-colonial scholarship gained a foothold, even if somewhat limp. In America, slavery has been, for a while now, the issue a la mode. A group of Harvard scholars has been taking a keen interest in the “history of capitalism”.Playing intellectual archaeologists, they’ve excavated the road that led to today’s age of plenty – leaving in its tracks a blood-drenched path of genocide, conquest, and slavery. The interest that this has garnered, for instance Sven Beckert’s Empire of Cotton, is heartening, but it has been limited to history (or worse still, “area studies”) departments rather than economics, and focused on the past not the present. As far back as the fifties ... the economy was driving the society, when it should have been the other way around  (Getty)Indeed, from the perspective of Western scholarship, the epistemic approach to the amalgam of these instances has been singularly inspired by Indiana Jones – dismissed either as curious empirical aberrations or distanced by the buffer of history. By no means the stuff of mainstream economic theory. Some of us weakly cleared our throats and tried to politely intercede that there were, all around us, petri dishes of living, breathing data on not just development – but capitalism itself. Maybe, just maybe – could it be? – that if the template failed to work in a large majority of cases around the globe that there may be a slight design error.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSanta Fe High School student Dakota Shrader is comforted by her mother Susan Davidson following a shooting at the school in Texas.

The best-selling author and my colleague at Cambridge, Ha-Joon Chang, in Kicking Away the Ladder, pointed out that it was a possibility that the West was misremembering the trajectory of its own ascent to power – that perhaps it was just a smidgen more fraught than it remembered, that maybe the State had had a somewhat more active part to play before it retired from the stage. But a bright red line separated the “us” from the “them” enforcing a system of strict epistemic apartheid. Indeed, as economics retreated further and further into its silo of smugness, economics departments largely stopped teaching economic history or sociology and development economics clung on by operating firmly within the discipline-approved methodology.  So far, so good – a bit like the last night of merriment on the Titanic. Then the iceberg hit. Suddenly the narratives that were comfortably to do with the there and then became for the Western world a matter of the here and now. In the last 10 years, what economic historian Robert Skidelsky recently referred to as the “lost decade” for the advanced industrial West, problems that were considered the exclusive preserve of development theory – declining growth, rampant inequality, failing institutions, a fractured political consensus, corruption, mass protests and poverty – started to be experienced on home turf.The Great Recession starting 2008 should really have been the first hint: foreclosures and evictions, bankruptcies and bailouts, crashed stock markets. Then came the eurozone crisis starting in 2009 (first Greece then Ireland then Portugal then Spain then Cyprus oh, and then Greece, again). But after an initial scare, it was largely business as usual – written off as an inevitable blip in the boom-bust logic of capitalist cycles. It was 2016, the year the world went mad, that made the writing on the wall impossible to turn away from – starting with the shock Brexit vote, and then the Trump election. Not everyone understands what a CDO (collateralised debt obligation) is, but the vulgarity of a leader of the free world who governs by tweet and “grabs pussy” is hard to miss. So how did it happen, this unexpected epilogue to the end of history? I hate to say I told you so, but some of us had seen this coming – the twist in the tale, foreshadowed by an eerie background score lurking behind the clinking of champagne glasses. Even at the height of the glory days. In the summer before the fall of Lehman Brothers, a group of us “heterodox economists” had gathered at a summer school in the North of England. We felt like the audience at a horror movie – knowing that the gory climax was moments away while the victim remained blissfully impervious. Amid questions over his appeal, PM Modi\u0027s party sweeps to key victoryIs India\u0027s tourism \u0027pro-poor\u0027 if it fails to reduce absolute poverty?Chinese investment in Africa \u0027could create dependent economies\u0027The plot wasn’t just predictable, it was in the script for anyone to see. You just had to look closely at the fine print. In particular, you needed to have read your Karl Polanyi, the economic sociologist, who predicted this crisis over 5 years ago. As far back as 1954, The Great Transformation diagnosed the central perversion of the capitalist system, the inversion that makes the person less important than the thing – the economy driving society, rather than the other way around.Polanyi’s point was simple: if you turned all the things that people hold sacred into grist to the mill of a large impersonal economic machinery (he called this disembedding) there would be a backlash. That the fate of a world where monopoly money reigns supreme and human players are reduced to chessmen at its mercy is doomed. The sociologist Fred Block compares this to the stretching of a giant elastic band – either it reverts to a more rooted position, or it snaps. It is this tail-wagging-the-dog quality that is driving the current crisis of capitalism. It’s a matter of existential alienation. This problem of artificial abstraction runs through the majority of upheavals of our age – from the financial crisis to Facebook. So cold were the nights in this era of enforced neutrality that the torrid affair between liberal democracy and neoclassical economics resulted in the most surprising love child – populism.The simple fact is that after decades on promises not delivered on, the system had written just one too many cheques that couldn’t be cashed. And people had had just about enough. The Brexit vote in 2016 followed by the election of Trump ... and the world had finally gone mad (Getty)The old fault lines of global capitalism, the East versus West dynamics of the World Trade Organisation’s Doha Round, turned out to be red herrings. The axis that counts is the system versus the little people. Indeed, the anatomies of annihilation look remarkably similar across the globe – whether it’s the loss of character of a Vanishing New York or Disappearing London, or threatened communities of farmers in India and fishermen in Greece.Trump voters in the US, Brexiteers in Britain and Modi supporters in India seek identity – any identity, even a made-up call to arms to “return” to mythical past greatness in the face of the hollowing out of meaning of the past 70 years. The rise of populism is, in many ways, the death cry of populations on the verge of extinction – yearning for something to believe in when their gods have died young. It’s a problem of the 1 per cent – poised to control two-thirds of the world economy by 2030 – versus the 99 per cent. But far more pernicious is the Frankenstein’s monster that is the idea of an economic system that is an end in itself. Not to be too much of a conspiracy theorist about it, but the current system doesn’t work because it wasn’t meant to – it was rigged from the start. Wealth was never actually going to “trickle down”. Thomas Piketty did the maths. Suddenly, the alarmist calls of the developmentalists objecting to the systemic skews in the process of globalisation don’t seem quite so paranoid. But this is more than “poco” (what the cool kids call postcolonialism) schadenfreude. My point is a serious one although I would scarcely have dared articulate it before now. Could Kipling have been wrong, and might the East have something to offer the mighty West? Could the experiences of exotic lands point the way back to the future? Could it be, could it just, that it may even be a source of epistemic wisdom? Behind the scaffolding of Xi Jinping’s China  or Narendra Modi’s India, sites of capitalism under construction, we are offered a glimpse into the system’s true nature. It is not God-given, but the product of highly political choices. Just like Jane Jacobs protesting to save Washington Square Park or Beatrix Potter devoting the bulk of her royalty earnings to conserving the Lake District were choices. But these cases also show that trust and community are important. The incredible resilience of India’s jugaad economy, or the critical role of quanxi in the creation of the structures in what has been for the past decade the world’s fastest-growing nation, China. A little mysticism and magic may be just the thing. The narrative that we need is less that of Frankenstein’s man-loses-control of monster, and more that of Pinocchio’s toy-becomes-real-boy-by-acquiring-conscience less technology, and more teleology. The real limit may be our imaginations. Perhaps the challenge is to do for scholarship, what Black Panther has done for Hollywood. You never know. Might be a blockbuster.Dr Antara Haldar is the inaugural lecturer in Empirical Legal Studies at the University of Cambridge.

That’s the claim being made by a team of 33 researchers published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.They are not referring to aliens in a metaphorical sense, but literal aliens from outer space.Since the paper was released on Sunday, a trickle of news coverage has turned into a torrent, with increasingly alarming headlines about octopuses and their extra-terrestrial origins. Octopus discovered making armour out of shells on Blue Planet IIIt will not come as a surprise to many to learn that these claims have been roundly mocked by the scientific community, who have branded the paper – published in Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology – as ridiculous and unscientific.What are the claims being made?They suggest the Cambrian explosion, a sudden burst of life that occurred around 540 million years ago, was the result of extra-terrestrial intervention.\u0026nbspThe paper asks whether this event, which saw the rapid emergence of most of the main animal groups that still exist on Earth today, was “terrestrial or cosmic”. Their conclusion is the latter.How do the scientists suggest this would work?Specifically, the researchers propose the idea that alien viruses crashed to Earth in a meteor, infected a population of primitive squid and caused them to evolve into octopuses.\u0026nbspAnother theory they suggest is that fertilised squid or octopus eggs were delivered to Earth by a meteor.Are octopuses aliens from outer space? This peer-reviewed article by 33 scientists argues that the octopus genome is too complex to have evolved naturally on earth and therefore that octopuses probably came...from space\u0026nbsphttps:t.coR7qE77AGrJ\u0026nbsppic.twittervgDC5vgDz6The idea is essentially a\u0026nbspreimagining\u0026nbspof the “panspermia” hypothesis, which suggests that life on Earth was “seeded” by space dust or asteroids crashing into Earth. One of its first proponents,\u0026nbspChandra\u0026nbspWickramasinghe, is one of the authors of the new paper.Why do the researchers look at the octopus in particular?Octopuses are weird. They are molluscs, meaning they are closely related to snails, and yet they are incredibly intelligent.\u0026nbspOn top of their large brains and sophisticated nervous systems, the authors of the new paper list camera-like eyes, flexible bodies and ability to camouflage themselves by changing colour and shape as evidence of their extra-terrestrial origins.So suddenly did these features appear in the octopus family tree that “it is plausible then to suggest they seem to be borrowed from a far distant ‘future’ in terms of terrestrial evolution, or more realistically from the cosmos at large,” the authors write.\u0026nbsp“Such an extraterrestrial origin as an explanation of emergence of course runs counter to the prevailing dominant paradigm,” they continue. This is a strong contender for understatement of the century.What reason is there to doubt the claims being made in the paper?There are plenty of reasons. First off, as Mark\u0026nbspCarnall\u0026nbspfrom the Oxford University Museum of Natural History pointed out in a series of tweets, not one of the paper’s authors is a zoologist.\u0026nbspMuch of the authors’ speculation rests on the idea that the genetics of octopuses and their relatives are mysterious – yet a\u0026nbsp2015 paper published in\u0026nbspNature\u0026nbsprevealed the octopus genome, so this is rather disingenuous.In fact, octopus genes suggest they fit into the generally understood theory of the evolution of life on Earth, and require no alien invasion. They are thought to have split from the squid lineage around 135 million years ago.Molecular geneticist Professor\u0026nbspKarin\u0026nbspMoelling\u0026nbspof the Max Planck Institute Molecular Genetics, who was asked to review the report, concluded that it cannot be taken seriously”.The primary reason for doubt given by Professor\u0026nbspMoelling\u0026nbspis that there is “no evidence at all”.Haven’t I heard something about octopuses being aliens before?Writers are fond of comparing octopuses to aliens due to their unusual appearance and great intelligence. Philosopher Peter Godfrey-Smith, who has written a book about octopus intelligence titled\u0026nbspOther Minds, has described them as “the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien”.On top of that, this is not the first time octopuses have been mistakenly labelled aliens by the press.\u0026nbspAn unfortunately worded press release concerning the\u0026nbspNature\u0026nbsppaper describing the octopus genome led to a slew of online news pieces in 2015 about researchers finding “alien DNA” in these creatures.Code of ConductInstall our AppsWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

His supporters successfully campaigned for social and political reform and against a corrupt and dysfunctional political establishment.It was the latest surprise in the career of a man who barely survived the murder of his father, the revered Shia religious leader Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr, and his two brothers, on the orders of Saddam Hussein in 1999.Four years later, after the US invasion of Iraq, he was in danger once again of being killed, this time by American forces who twice besieged him in the holy city of Najaf in 2004.Mr Sadr will be very much the kingmaker – though he will have no official position – in the formation of a new Iraqi government.His coalition, which includes the Iraqi Communist Party, independents and secularists as well as his religious followers, appealed strongly to Iraqis who feel that, with the war won against Isis, they need to rebuild their country.The Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi hoped to win the election – though no party was ever likely to win an absolute majority – by appealing to voters as the leader who recaptured Mosul from Isis last year.He followed this up with a largely bloodless reoccupation of Kirkuk, held by the Kurds since 2003, and the restoration of a large measure of government authority in Iraqi Kurdistan.The political movement formed out of the largely Shia paramilitaries, the Hashd al-Shaabi, which came second in the polls, had, like Mr Abadi, hoped to win more votes through their role in the war against Isis.Coalition led by nationalist cleric takes shock lead in Iraqi electionUS and Iran battle for influence in first post-Isis Iraq electionWomen brace for Iraq’s election after race marked by harassment What would Trump have done about Saddam Hussein? But the drop in violence to a level not seen since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein means that Iraqis are focusing on the theft by the political elite of hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenues that should have been used to improve the supply of water, electricity, waste disposal as well medical care and education.Mr Sadr has been frequently underestimated as a political leader since he first emerged from house arrest in Najaf at the time of the US invasion.He was described by the western media as a ‘maverick’ or ‘firebrand cleric’, but his views were always more sophisticated and flexible than he was given credit for.The origin of Mr Sadr’s influence was his family’s role as religious leaders and the martyrdom of many of them, beginning with the execution of Mohammed Baqr al-Sadr in 1980.His father led a movement that appealed to the Shia poor of Baghdad and southern Iraq, combining religious revivalism with social and political radicalism. From the start, Sadrism had a strong element of Iraqi nationalism in opposition to all foreign interference in Iraq, be it American, British or Iranian.‘The near future of Iraq is dark’: Warning from Muqtada al-Sadr -In an interview with The Independent in Najaf in 2013 – the first he had given face to face to a Western journalist for 10 years – Mr Sadr spoke graphically of the ill effects of Iraq inviting in different foreign powers to try to solve its problems. He compared this to “somebody who found a mouse in his house, then he kept a cat, then he wanted to get the cat out of the house so he kept a dog, then to get the dog out of his house he bought an elephant, so he bought a mouse”,Mr Sadr created the Shia paramilitary Mehdi Army to resist the Americans. He was later to stand this down during the Sunni-Shia sectarian mass killings of 2006-7, saying that it had been infiltrated by people not under his control.He was denounced by the US as a pro-Iranian proxy, but he has made clear over the years that he opposes Iranian interference as well as that of other countries.The Sadrist success in the election this month will be unwelcome in both Washington and Tehran.The US had done everything it could to back Mr Abadi as a victorious war leader and a sort of Iraqi Winston Churchill – forgetting, perhaps, that Churchill lost the British general election in 1945.Mr Sadr’s influence over an incoming government in Baghdad puts in doubt the future of the 10,000 American troops and military contractors in Iraq, though a Sadrist spokesman said after the election that US training and the weapons procurement from the US could continue.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSanta Fe High School student Dakota Shrader is comforted by her mother Susan Davidson following a shooting at the school in Texas.

When I interviewed him five years ago he warned against Sunni-Shia sectarianism and foreign interference. He said: “The Iraqi people will disintegrate, its government will disintegrate and it will be easy for foreign powers to control the country.” This prediction was to be fulfilled six months later when Isis took Mosul and the Iraqi army broke up.Mr Sadr said that sectarianism was spreading at street level and “if it spreads among the people, it will be difficult to fight”.Iraqi politics is still largely based on sectarian or ethnic identity – Shia, Sunni and Kurd – but the religious parties that were in the ascendant after 2003 have discredited themselves. The majority Shia community is also more confident, after its military victories last year, that it is firmly in control and is not going to be dispossessed from power.Mr Sadr said that the problem was that the Iraqi psychology had been shaped by a “constant cycle of violence: Saddam, occupation, war after war, first Gulf war, the second Gulf war, then the occupation war”.The election this month, in which so many voters gave priority to social rather than security issues, may show that, as violence ebbs, Iraqis are becoming less traumatised.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The account said “history spits in the face of the country’s traitors”.The state-linked Al-Jazirah newspaper published on its front page a photo of Ms al-Hathloul and Ms al-Yousef under a headline describing them as citizens who betrayed the nation.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Rooms have been renovated, flowers planted in the design of the US flag and the seal of the US embassy has gone up.Security around the building has been upgraded, road signs installed and CCTV cameras set up in the area – all part of the renovations that President Trump says have cost a modest $400,000 (£295,000).After 14 months of rapid preparations, the consulate will be inaugurated to huge fanfare, with about 800 guests and a video address by President Trump beamed live around the world.The consulate building in Agron Road was constructed in 1868It was one of the first houses built outside Jerusalem\u0027s old city wallsThe original building had only two storeys a third was added in the early 20th centuryThe complex currently covers about 6,000 square metresPlans suggest it will be four times as big once converted, by the end of next yearRenovation work so far has cost £295,000The US government leases a second site in Jerusalem, in Nablus Road, providing visa services It will be a largely symbolic affair, however, because up to six more years of work are planned, including a 10ft perimeter wall, an opulent new chamber and several new floors – both upwards and underground – to house the 850 staff moving from Tel Aviv. Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, the opening has been hailed as the beginning of a new quarter in Arnona, south Jerusalem, for embassies from countries around the world that will spring up there.We will soon see the true nature of Trump’s work in the Middle EastNew law allows Palestinians in Jerusalem to have residency strippedTrump says recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ‘was wonderful\u0027“We might have to build dozens of embassies, and we would need new land ready for that purpose. I asked my ministry to vigorously take action as fast as possible, said construction minister Yoav Galant, The Jerusalem Post reported.Mr Galant even suggested possible names for the embassies area, the Post said. He initially called it “Embassy Town” but then decided he preferred “Trump Town” after the US president, who has deemed the city Israel’s capital. Ministers have already announced a new railway station near the Western Wall will be named after Mr Trump.The plan for the new consular facility was created and approved in little over a year thanks to the finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, exercising his authority to fast-track the process. And there will be celebrations aplenty on Monday.Many of those who know the site best, however, will not be joining in the festivities.When the rebuilding work begins in earnest, the embassy will be created in part by converting the Diplomat Hotel next door, which it also owns. The embassy will use the consulate building in the short term, but sources suggest the Diplomat is slated to house the embassy in the long run.For years, the hotel has been leased out as housing for about 450 elderly immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Now, the building is due to be demolished in two years’ time when the lease expires – and the residents have nowhere to go.Many of these men and women were doctors, musicians and academics in Russia before moving to Israel in the early 1990s, according to The Times of Israel. Some moved straight into the Diplomat and have never had any other home in the country.

The US State Department says the new purpose-built building will be ​​a long-term project.According to Ynet News, the website of Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, 20 planning companies and two New York firms were hired for the project. The US State Department usually employs selected American firms, but deviated from the norm by hiring an Israeli team, including architect Amir Mann and an Israeli contractor to carry out the work, it said.A five-storey structure was originally planned but to keep costs down the extra floors have not yet been completed, and the ambassador, David Friedman, will make only limited use of the embassy for now, using it for work but not yet moving in full-time.Both the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem consulates will provide passports and US visa services during the transition period.Neighbours have complained that the work, carried out under time pressures, could be environmentally unfriendly and risk going against planning and construction bylaws.But none is as worried as the 450 Russian residents.The job of finding a new home for them is down to Israel’s Immigrant Absorption Ministry.Ksenia Svetlova, a member of the Knesset, of the Zionist Union party, said the ministry has no set plan as to where or how the residents will be moved, and no estimate of potential costs or subsequent budget.She fears residents could be forced out before June 2020, when the lease expires.Just a few days before the historic opening of the beautiful United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Veils, polka dots, puff sleeves, she was always trying new things.Would she have liked Meghan? I think so.She’d have run her eye up and down her because although she wasn’t the sharpest tool in the box academia-wise, she had an A+ in intuition, but the important thing to her would be to know that she loved her son.If you could show her that then that would have been enough.If Diana was alive today I’ve no doubt she would be heavily involved with Meghan and Catherine and her grandchildren – and she would have been a very fun grandma.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some Jewish families live near the fence. Israel is right to fear for them.But its ruthlessness has handed Hamas the PR coup it cynically craves.MPs have again spared the Press and public a costly new “Leveson 2” witch-hunt.We congratulate Culture Secretary Matt Hancock and the 301 MPs who put Press freedom first. We doubt the rest, the Lords or Hacked Off will ever call it a day. But the media has changed beyond recognition since the last inquiry. Facebook and Google dominate. Newspapers are fighting for life.Campaigners should refocus away from their grudges and the distant past.It is more important to consider how a viable, noisy free Press can survive.THE vast sums blown on misguided ­Government environment obsessions are a monumental scandal.One £23billion scheme launched in 2011 to help people install heating systems using renewables was a huge flop.A Commons committee says forecasts were wildly over-optimistic, yet the Energy Department has since learned no lessons from it.Some politicians shouldn’t be trusted to boil a kettle, let alone run an energy budget worth billions.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Surprisingly good shape if you’re one of those Remainer banshees who said the entire country would be worth about two bob by now — no investment, no jobs, swarms of killer bees and plagues of locusts.Not a bit of it. Take employment. We now have the highest employment levels, and the lowest unemployment, for 42 years. We have an unemployment rate of 4.2 per cent.Would you like to know how our major European partners are getting on in that regard? Well, it’s 9.2 per cent in France, 10.8 per cent in Italy, a whopping 16.4 per cent in Spain and, of course, 20.9 per cent in chicken-in-a-basket case Greece.We’re even closing in on Germany, at 3.6 per cent.So that’s not bad for starters. Average earnings are at last rising, too. Inflation is down. Business investment is up.Better still, we are experiencing the kind of export boom we haven’t seen for a long time. A massive ten per cent increase in the past year.And for those who think this will all come to a halt when we actually leave the EU — um, no.The official statistics predict the boom is going to grow and grow. By 2020 it will have increased by 22 per cent. Much, much quicker than the growth in exports in EU countries.By then, of course, we’ll have an entire world to trade with, free of restraint.Assuming the Government doesn’t bugger it up by keeping us in the EU’s customs union.So, contrary to what you are often told, the news is all rather good for the UK.And there’s another country where the economy is looking pretty good, too.Donald Trump’s USA. The stockmarket is soaring to record levels. The economy is growing at a more than decent rate.But who have been the main winners of Trump’s presidency when it comes to the economy?Horrible rich white business-men, you might guess. That’s what was said when he won the presidency — he’d look after people like himself.Nope again. Dead wrong. The main beneficiaries have been the poorest of Americans. And in particular the blacks and Hispanics. Unemployment is down, employment is up.There are more black and Hispanic people in work than at any time under Barack Obama’s hopeless administration.Under Obama, the country was paying out record amounts in welfare benefits and food stamps for its black and Hispanic citizens.And if Trump manages to strike some kind of lasting peace deal with North Korea, he’ll deserve the Nobel prize.So here’s a prediction.Despite the toddler temper tantrums among Lefties whenever the name Trump is mentioned, despite the curled lip and sneer from BBC news reporters, the shrieking protest marches from thick-as-mince unwashed millennials, despite all that,I’ll bet you now that Donald Trump gets re-elected.But don’t expect to hear much about any of this on the BBC’s News at Ten.A NEW survey has discovered what British people worry about most.What is it? Maybe the spectre of Diane Abbott being Home Secretary? Global warming? Nuclear warfare? Or the black shadow of death hanging over their heads?Nope. It’s “not being in when a parcel is delivered”.Just how crap a worry is that? And people lie awake at night.Gripped by the terror that the Amazon delivery man might call round with the spare part for the hedge-trimmer when they’re down the shops.SO, you lot – you’re all gammons, apparently.That’s the name given by Jeremy Corbyn supporters to working-class people who voted for Brexit.You are dense lumps of pig meat. Which is often served with a fried egg and some chips. And a bit of pineapple on top.They coined the phrase because some of the Brexiteers seen on Question Time have red faces. OK.Many people have called this “racist”. Sometimes I think there is nothing in this world of ours which couldn’t be called racist by someone desperate to be offended.It’s not racist. But it tells you exactly what the Labour Party thinks of working-class people, doesn’t it?HERE we go again. England fans have been warned not to take the flag of St George with them if they go to support our lads in the World Cup finals in Russia.The police have told them the flag is too “imperialistic” and “antagonistic”.So, every other nation will be waving their flag. Just not us.Mind you, I think I’d give Russia a swerve either way.If the Russki thugs don’t get you, then the police will.And you’ll have difficulty telling them apart. Or you’ll end up looking like one of those glo-sticks children wave around.Wait until the tournament is held in a civilised country.(So that’s Qatar out too then).Listen, it’s just a matter of economics.Making a dress the size of a bleedin’ aircraft hangar costs more than it does to make a nice size 12. It uses more material.So either cut out the seven stuffed-crust pizzas you eat every day for your elevenses, plus the bucket of chicken wings.Or pay the extra price.MORE good news – the Government has voted down attempts to strangle the Press.There will be no new Leveson inquiry.What’s more, it looks like Tom Watson is going to give up on his ludicrous campaign to force newspapers to pay court fees even when they win legal proceedings against them.Tom dreamed this up presumably with help from his best chum, the former fascist Max “Beat me, beat me, Brunehilde!” Mosley.Dead in the water, Watson.THINGS In This World I Don’t Care Much About (No 1): Whether Meghan’s dad Thomas, makes it to the wedding or not. Yet it’s all I’ve heard about on the news recently.I’m not being mean. I hope they all have a lovely day.But I couldn’t give a monkey’s if Meghan was led up the aisle by her dad, or Piers Morgan, or a flock of cackling greylag geese.In truth, Meghan and the royals aside, does anyone else?ISRAEL has over-reacted in trying to control the Palestinians rioting by the border fence.It’s handed a huge propaganda coup to the racist terrorists of Hamas. They’re the ones who provoked the rioters. Told them to break down the fence and kill Jews.But all that gets forgotten when there’s TV footage of Israeli soldiers shooting people. Even if they are bombarded with Molotov cocktails.It’s still the case that the biggest barrier to peace is Hamas, not Israel.LIKE you, I’m working on my hip cleavage so I’ll look dead good on the beach this summer.I’m going to have my bikini bottom glued somewhere just below my armpits, in order to look like Bella Hadid or Genie Bouchard or Alessandra Ambrosio.It all reminds me of the old joke. Young bloke complains that no girls on the beach fancy him. Won’t even look at him.So his friend advises: “Put a couple of potatoes in your trunks. Then they’ll look.”Young bloke comes back the next day and says: “It’s even worse. Now they run away from me.”His friend looks at his trunks and says: “I meant put the potatoes down the FRONT of your trunks, not the back.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mrs May cannot even rely on her own MPs.Consider what she’s up against:An EU which has spent two years playing games, either to reverse Brexit or extract a fortune from us while nullifying us as an economic threat.Unelected peers, contemptuous not only of the referendum verdict but the democracy that produced it.Tory backbenchers putting their party’s very existence a distant second to getting their own way on Europe.And a Labour Party solely concerned with ousting the Tories, even if it means wrecking our negotiating strategy.The PM’s task is being made impossible.THE problem on some of our train lines is not that they need to be nationalised.

It needs to change to survive.Prime Minister Theresa May won as many votes last year as Margaret Thatcher did in her prime.She earned the party its biggest share of working-class votes since 1979.The Conservatives are now back ahead in the polls.But across some of the parts of the population that are growing the fastest, the Conservatives are still trailing behind Labour.In last year’s General Election, Jeremy Corbyn’s Little Red Book did not just win over university students.He also won over half of people in their thirties.A recent poll showed only nine per cent of those aged 25 to 39 say they will definitely vote Conservative.The Conservatives are behind among people who rent their homes privately — and there are twice the number doing that as there were in 2000.Nearly four times as many people from ethnic minority communities voted Labour than voted Tory — and those different communities are a growing part of our population.So if the Conservative Party does not broaden its reach, it is finished. It is that simple.That does not mean the Prime Minister should copy Corbyn’s empty promises.Let’s not forget that Labour’s most recent manifesto proposed to raise taxes to their highest level since World War Two.Or that Corbyn’s plans to borrow huge, unprecedented sums of money to embark on a spending spree would put a millstone of debt around the necks of younger people.Or that the only thing he wants to cut is our defence budget — and from the Falklands to Russia, he has a bad habit of siding with Britain’s enemies.The Tories have spent eight years cleaning up the mess Labour left behind. We do not want to repeat their mistakes.We remember the dangerous situation where the Government was borrowing a quarter of all the money it spent.We did the hard yards slashing the dole queues Labour left behind, and now we have got more people in work than ever before.But we can not just rest on our record. There are five big challenges we need to solve if we are going to deserve the votes of Sun readers at the next election.The FIRST is obvious — we have to make a success of Brexit. We should ignore pompous members of the House of Lords who say we should just override the democratic result of the referendum.But we should make sure we listen when businesses and exporters say they want sensible arrangements to keep business flowing between Britain and Europe. That’s exactly what the PM is negotiating.The SECOND is to give young people at least the same chances to get on in life that older people have enjoyed.That means reversing 15 years of falling home ownership and building more homes that young working people can afford.But it also means reforming taxes to focus on growing the number of homeowners, not just expanding the amount of rented property.The THIRD challenge is to build a united Britain and make the Conservative Party feel like the natural home for working people, whatever their race or religion.We believe we must continue to strongly control immigration and stop illegal immigration. But we also believe in making sure everyone can feel part of Britain.We admire those who have come here with nothing and built amazing businesses — and we know that the Conservative priorities of enterprise, family and education are often their priorities, too.Many feel very patriotic about this great country that is now their home. That is why we, as a party, must do much more to reach out to ethnic minority communities.It is why, in government, we must make sure that everyone, no matter their background, gets help to speak good English so they can get a good job and be part of a united country.FOURTH, we need to do much more to help places that have suffered in recent decades. Not just by aiding big cities such as Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham — some of which are now growing faster than London.But also by tackling deprivation in the neglected smaller towns and coastal communities where opportunities have been hard to come by for years.FIFTH, we must build an economy that really does work for everyone, not just the well-off.It is brilliant that unemployment is at a 40-year low. But wages fell a long way in the last recession and though they are growing, working people have been through a very difficult decade.Policies such as the National Living Wage and tax cuts for the lower-paid have helped those who want to work, earn more and keep more of their earnings.But now we have to find ways to raise average wages and help businesses invest in their workers.Government should be taking more of a role in helping people to retrain between jobs or to work in new industries to reduce the impact of new technology.And we must do more to help working families with everyday costs of living. That means cutting high energy bills and helping working families who face some of the most expensive childcare in the developed world.If we do these things and govern always in the interests of working people, we can beat Corbyn’s tried-and-failed 1970s politics.By becoming the party for working people, the Conservative Party can earn a solid majority and make Britain fairer — and more united.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She got her Brexit inner Cabinet to agree that in the event of no trade deal being in place by December 2020, the UK would continue to apply the EU’s common external tariff.The decision goes back to the issue of the Irish border and the “backstop” May agreed last December. This said that in the event of no deal being done, the UK would keep Northern Ireland in line with EU rules on customs, agriculture and manufactured goods.The DUP, the Ulster party on which Mrs May depends for her Commons majority, would never accept a Northern Ireland-only deal. So the Government wants to apply this backstop to the whole UK.The situation is far from ideal. It shows why the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, was right to have such misgivings about the backstop. He argued that by agreeing what would happen in the event of ‘no deal’ the UK was reducing its negotiating leverage.There is also a danger the backstop reduces the EU’s incentive to negotiate a comprehensive free-trade deal.Brexiteer ministers are intrigued by new Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s idea of keeping the customs revenues collected under the backstop in trust, only handing them over to the EU once the final deal is done.The UK’s position in these talks has been weakened by its failure to properly prepare for no deal.The EU knows the UK isn’t ready to walk away so it keeps pushing, knowing the need for a deal means we will almost certainly fold in the end.The final problem is that the UK still doesn’t know precisely what it wants. The backstop is only meant to apply if either a trade deal or technology can’t solve the Irish border problem.But right now there is more agreement in the Brexit inner Cabinet on the backstop — which, officially, they don’t want to happen — than on either of those two options.I understand from those involved in ministerial working groups looking at customs options they are still a long way off any conclusions. I am also told these working groups aren’t coming up with answers but doing “preparatory work to inform a later discussion”.So why aren’t Brexiteers kicking off at all these cans been kicked down the road?Well, as one influential figure, explains to me: “It is all very unsatisfactory but it is what it is.” In other words, given the mistakes that have been made, there isn’t really an alternative.The other reason is the view among several of the most important Brexiteers that they can’t get what they want at the moment, so they should play it long. The thinking goes that it is better to accept more temporary measures than to agree to bad permanent arrangements.But it is being whispered in Westminster that if Brexiteers are to get what they want, they need control of the government machine — and that means one of their own in Number 10.Moving against Theresa May now is simply too risky.Bringing her down could bring Brexit down.But in the past week, the talk of a challenge to her shortly after Britain has legally, if not practically, left the EU has risen in volume.Those around Mrs May want her to fight the next election.They also argue that any leadership contest before the whole Brexit process is done would risk splitting the Tories beyond repair.But this week, the chances of a challenge to Mrs May soon after March 30 next year substantially increased.ALL eyes will be on Windsor today for the Royal Wedding – but in Westminster, Tories are getting increasingly excited about the possibility of some political nuptials.On Monday night, the Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson and Environment Secretary Michael Gove will launch a new group designed to craft a post-Brexit agenda for the party. This joint appearance has set tongues wagging and left Tories wondering if they could one day be joined in political union.Davidson and Gove were on opposite sides of the Brexit referendum and until recently, she was – in private – no fan of his. But that has changed.One ally of hers tells me: “Relations are warmer than they have ever been.” What has brought them together? Fish. Davidson knows it is politically vital for Scottish Tories to secure a clean break from the Common Fisheries Policy.And Gove, whose adopted father was an Aberdeen fish merchant, is an ally against Chancellor Philip Hammond’s desire to use fishing as a bargaining chip in the negotiations.The question is whether this alliance of convenience could develop into something more lasting. Many Tories still dream of Davidson coming south after the Scottish Parliament elections in 2021. They think her charisma, combined with Gove’s radicalism, would be just the ticket.But there are huge logistical challenges to getting Davidson to Westminster before the next election, even if she wanted to. So could she back Gove?I am told she is keeping her options open at the moment. But what is certain is that whoever she did back would get a massive boost.If Davidson is not going to try to be queen, she can be the Tory kingmaker.So one wonders what Bercow, the Speaker of the House, would say about a minister calling someone a “stupid woman”.Yet tellingly, his office’s statement doesn’t deny the claim that he called Andrea Leadsom, the Leader of the House of Commons, that in a private aside on Wednesday.But there are no signs of a public apology from Bercow.It is hard not to conclude that he is determined to hang on to his job whatever damage he does to the role.ITALY, one of the founding members of the EU, is set to be governed by a populist coalition who want to renegotiate key parts of the European project.The biggest threat the new Italian government poses is to the future of the Eurozone. The new coalition’s programme would cost more than 100billion euros. This will put them in breach of the Eurozone’s deficit rules. To add insult to injury, the European Central Bank (ECB) buys a substantial amount of Italy’s sovereign debt.So the ECB would effectively be financing part of this programme.The result will be a backlash in northern European countries. They will wonder why Italy should get away with this. The result: The prospect of proper reform to fix the Eurozone’s structural weaknesses is dead.This is the Eurozone’s problem. Politics makes the reforms it needs impossible. Next time a global financial crisis hits, the Eurozone will have unique vulnerabilities.She said Tory MPs were telling her that both the party and the country needed unity at this moment and noises off didn’t help with that.But I am told the Prime Minister’s appeals on this front are becoming so frequent they are losing their force.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Both sides want a deal. But if the EU also tries to cripple us as a trading power, there are 60 Brexit-backing Tories ready to veto it.The PM has made many concessions to the EU already. She must be more militant.WHY is the grotesquely self-important toad John Bercow still Commons Speaker?For years he has polluted proceedings with his verbose grandstanding, interrupting MPs to rebuke them at tedious length for some minor transgression.His endless convoluted put-downs take up precious debating time.Bercow already faces two bullying accusations which he denies and MPs strangely do not wish to probe.Now, after yet another unhinged rant, he seems to have branded Andrea Leadsom “a stupid woman”. Had a Tory frontbencher done similar, Bercow would have gone berserk.In our view he has now crossed a line.

Kings 1960s hit Stand By Me to the couple, who had earlier been given their new titles as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.They were soon able to meet the rapturous crowds of more than 100,000 as they were taken through Windsor in a carriage.Meanwhile, speaking from the US, the brides father Thomas Markle said she looked beautiful.The 73-year-old, who was unable to attend the wedding after recently undergoing heart surgery, said he wished he was with his daughter on her big day.Majesty Magazines Ms Seward added that the star of the wedding was the American preacher, The Most Reverend Michael Curry, saying it was nice to see the royal family relax during the ceremony.Royal historian Sarah Gristwood, who wrote Elizabeth - The Queen and Crown, told The Sun Online that the wedding had thrust the Royal Wedding into the 21st century.She said that while it was already known that Meghan would enter the chapel alone, it hadnt been realised just how different the ceremony would be.Ms Gristwood added: It was partly the strong American presence and partly the strong black presence.Not only the bride and groom said I do but the congregation and family said I will.A lot of lessons were learned from Princess Dianas life and death - and this feels like one of them.Weve obviously seen some turmoil in Meghans family this week and this was a real open recognition of both of the potential for family trouble and family support. But royal expert Dickie Arbiter, the Queens former press spokesman, told The Sun Online said the Royal Family had always been evolving, saying that Prince Harry and brother Prince William were following in their mothers footsteps.He said: It was a great example of how the monarchy continues to evolve.But we can’t forget that it’s been changing and evolving for the past 1,000 years.He said that Prince Charles holding mother-of-the-bride Doria Raglands hand as she left the pews was a way of showing they were now family.Peter Rolfe, owner of luxury events organiser PAVE London, added: What is obvious is how much the black community have been featured in the ceremony so far, which is different from previous royal weddings.Its nice to put in Meghans heritage with the head of the Episcopal Church was probably the most memorable speaker in the ceremony.He was very arousing. His speech about love caught everyone in the church by surprise in the church.Some of the faces in the church showed they werent expecting such a rousing address.The whole day has been a blend of tradition, which the American guests will love, and modern elements, such as the choir singing Stand By Me. It shows Harry and Meghan are very much in love and blending their backgrounds. The Royal Family were front and centre in the chapel, with the Queen and an unaided 96-year-old Prince Philip - recovering after a hip op - cheered as they walked into the chapel this morning.And the Markles mum Doria, who flew into London from the US this week, was seen in tears during the ceremony.She had joined her 36-year-old daughter as they were driven from the chapel from Cliveden House in the drive in a vintage Rolls-Royce Phantom to the chapel.Harry wore full military uniform, sharing a nervous joke with his brother and best man Wills as crowds cheered.Kensington Palace confirmed that the Royal brothers would be wearing the frockcoat uniform of the Blues and Royals, with the Queen giving her permission for Prince Harry to marry in his uniform. The dress focuses on the open bateau neckline that slightly shows the shoulders, with a figure fitting sculpted waistline.Its made of six seams, with a flowing train and an underskirt made of triple silk organza.It also has three-quarter length sleeves.Givenchy also created the stunning five metre long veil, which is decorated with hand-embroidered flowers representing all 53 countries of the Commonwealth - a design detail requested by Meghan. It is made from silk tulle with the floral decorations made out of silk threads and organza.The workers who made the veil spent hundreds of hours making the intricate design - and had to wash their hands every THIRTY minutes to keep the materials pristine.The front of the veil shows crops of wheat blending into the flora, to symbolise love and charity.Meghans heels are made of aptly named duchess satin and have a pointed toe.And for the mini-mes - Givenchy also designed the six adorable bridesmaids dresses.Each dress is high waisted with short puffed sleeves and a silk ribbon detail at the back, tied into a bow. The dresses were made of a prestigious fabric called ivory silk radzimir.Handily - they came complete with pockets, and pleated skirts.Famous faces including Oprah Winfrey, George Clooney and wife Amal, Elton John and Thomas Hardy were also among the throng of hundreds of guests to pour into St Georges Chapel.Among the other arrivals were Princess Dianas brother Earl Spencer, Prince Harrys ex-girlfriends Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy and Kates pregnant sister Pippa Middleton and mum Carole.Tennis champ Serena Williams, Lady Kitty Spencer, Chloe Madeley and James Haskell and Meghans Suits co-star Patrick Adams and singer James Blunt were also there.Marcus Mumford of Mumford and Sons, and Princess Dianas butler Paul Burrell were also snapped heading into the chapel. David Beckham looked dapper in a grey morning suit complete with waistcoast and tails, while wife Victoria wore a navy dress with long sleeves and bright red shoes as they posed with fans in Windsor.Rugby royalty Jonny Wilkinson, James Haskell and Sir Clive Woodward were all in attendance in a nod to Harrys role as head of the Rugby Football Union.And Sarah Ferguson cast aside any speculation she would not be invited as she turned up for the service, wearing a dark navy dress.The big day comes after Meghans family drama threatened to overshadow the plans earlier this week, with the reclusive dad Thomas Markle revealed to have staged paparazzi photographs.The 73-year-old was paid for the snaps, which showed him in a number of situations including reading a book on Britain and working out.Meghans estranged family has also not been shy in holding back, regularly trashing the bride ahead of her big day.Kensington Palace confirmed that Thomas Sr wouldnt be attending, with a statement from Meghan saying that she had always cared for her father but that he needed to focus on his health. Send us your Royal Wedding pictures!

As an actress on the red carpet she is used to wearing striking, and sometimes revealing, dresses, so she could well choose something similar for the party.Royal weddings have more British traditions than most, but Meghan is sure to bring some American traditions of her own - especially to the reception.They have already bucked the British tradition of a fruit cake by having a lemon and elderflower sponge, and may well have more dainties at the after-party. During cake-cutting ceremonies in the US, the newlyweds feed each other the first two slices of the cake - and often stuff the cake into each other\u0027s faces.The first dance in the UK takes place after the cake-cutting, but in the US, the couple usually have the first dance immediately after they are announced into the dining room.Meghan is likely to toss her bouquet into a crowd of single female guests, but whether Harry will follow the American tradition of lifting up the bride\u0027s gown to pull off a garter and fling it into a group of his friends remains to be seen. She previously said she would not have a maid or matron of honour as she could not pick between her good friends.However, as it is tradition in America for the chief bridesmaid to give a speech, either - or all - of her her best friends, Jessica Mulroney, Lindsay Roth and Misha Nonoo could give a speech.It is not known whether there is a noise curfew for Frogmore House, but because it is fairly secluded it is thought the party could go on into the early hours of Sunday.

Oliver McGrath spotted McFly singer Tom Fletcher yesterday and decided to seize the opportunity to ask him to record a message for his girlfriend, Lydia.  It all started off smoothly, but as Oliver turned to take a panning shot in the video he fell to the ground – dislocating his knee in the process.  Despite now having to hobble around on crutches, he has been able to see the funny side after documenting it all on film.  “I was helping out at a Duke of Edinburgh event at Buckingham Palace , Oliver told the Leicester Mercury.  “I saw Tom and, because I know Lydia loves him, I thought I have a bit of time, I’ll go ask him for a message. “When he said ‘Buckingham Palace’ I tried to do a really dramatic shot where I’d get all of Buckingham Palace in. “Then I just fell to the ground.

I\u0027m here with your boyfriend and he\u0027s asked me to say hello, so hello from Buckingham Palace.  At this point, Oliver dropped, and Tom promptly asked: You alright? Oliver has since shared the video of the moment on social media, which Tom has replied to. The songwriter said: “Pleased you’re ok dude. Even more pleased you caught the moment on camera!” Commenting on the star’s reaction in the aftermath, Oliver said: “He was so lovely about the whole thing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"bridesmaid princess charlotte pageboy prince","story":"NewsBridesmaid Princess Charlotte gives cute wave to the crowds as she arrives at royal wedding with Prince GeorgeThe siblings were joined by all the other children who have been given starring roles in Meghan and Prince Harry\u0027s big day as they walked into the church\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseySocial Audience Writer12:04, 19 MAY 2018Updated12:43, 19 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAdorable bridesmaid Princess Charlotte gave a little wave as she arrived at her uncle Harry\u0027s wedding.

The display, which also features foxgloves with branches of beech, birch and hornbeam, also extends to outside the chapel, lining the West Steps and surrounding the West Door through which Meghan will enter the church. The display has been carefully crafted by floral designer Philippa Craddock.  This morning it was announced Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex as the prince prepares to marry his American bride in a glittering ceremony watched around the world by millions. The Queen\u0027s grandson, who is sixth in line to the throne, will pledge to love, comfort, honour and protect the former actress as they become husband and wife in the historic surrounds of St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle. Hours before the ceremony, Buckingham Palace announced that Harry has been given a dukedom - the highest rank in the British peerage - and Meghan will become Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Sussex.  Harry also received Scottish and Northern Irish titles, becoming the Earl of of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel, which means Meghan will become the Countess of Dumbarton and Baroness Kilkeel. Tens of thousands of royal fans have begun to descend on the Berkshire town to catch a glimpse of the bride and groom, as police have effectively created a ring of steel around the castle in a massive security operation. Passengers on the first train out of London Waterloo to Windsor included four women who work as cabin crew for a Canadian airline who said they wanted to be part of history. It\u0027s a once in a lifetime opportunity. We are sending our love from Canada, Cara Bonhage added.  Weather forecasters are expecting wall-to-wall sunshine, meaning the newlywed couple will be able to ride through Windsor town centre in the open top Ascot landau for their carriage procession. Some 250 members of the armed forces will take part in the pomp and ceremony of the celebrations, with regiments closely connected to former soldier Harry lining the streets. Meghan will emerge from the hour-long televised ceremony, which begins at noon, as an HRH and a member of the British royal family after saying her vows.  On Friday evening, a relaxed-looking Harry said he felt great as he greeted well-wishers in a surprise walkabout with best man the Duke of Cambridge outside Windsor Castle. The pair then headed to exclusive Coworth Park country house hotel in Ascot, where the prince was spending his last night as a single man away from his bride as is tradition. Meanwhile 15 miles away, Meghan gave a radiant smile and said she was feeling wonderful as she arrived with her mother Doria Ragland at the luxury Cliveden House Hotel in Taplow, Berkshire. Around 30 members of the royal family including the Queen and the 96-year-old Duke of Edinburgh, who is well enough to attend after undergoing a recent hip operation, will gather in the 600-strong congregation.  The Archbishop of Canterbury, who will marry Harry and Meghan, has spoken of the strong bond the couple share. There\u0027s profound affection between them which is wonderful and a deep understanding and mutual support, he said. You see in the way they respond to each other, caring for each other, which is something you see in many couples but not always. As the Order of Service was published on the morning of the wedding, it revealed Harry will wear a ring - not a given for royal men - and Meghan will not promise to obey her husband in the vows.  The moving, soul classic Stand By Me by Ben E King will be performed by Karen Gibson and The Kingdom Choir, with the gospel singers also delivering Etta James\u0027 uplifting version of Amen/This Little Light of Mine - a favourite in African-American churches. The presiding bishop of the American Episcopal Church Bishop, Michael Curry will give the address. Celebrities including Meghan\u0027s former Suits co-stars Patrick J. Adams and Gabriel Macht are expected to be among the guests, along with the couple\u0027s trusted inner circle of friends. The Prince of Wales will take on the role of the absent father of the bride Thomas Markle, and walk his future daughter-in-law through the Quire up the altar to meet her groom.  There will be sadness amid the joy for Meghan with her father missing her big day. The reclusive former TV lighting director will be thousands of miles away in Mexico after pulling out of attending on medical advice with just two days to go after undergoing heart surgery. Harry too will be thinking of his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in car crash when he was 12. He has invited her three siblings, Earl Spencer, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, as a way of honouring her. Lady Jane is giving a reading.  Meghan will leave her country hotel with her mother to be driven to Windsor Castle, giving the first glimpse of the bride in her wedding gown. She will walk through the Nave of the stunning chapel on her own, followed by a procession of bridesmaids and pageboys, before meeting Charles at the start of the Quire. William, whose children Prince George and Princess Charlotte will be among the young helpers, will be supporting his younger brother Harry at the altar. The Duchess of Cambridge will be there, making her first public appearance since giving birth to her third child Prince Louis less than four weeks ago.

Despite family dramas playing out over the past week, Harry and Meghan\u0027s royal wedding went off without a hitch.  There was pomp and ceremony, there were tears and cute kids - even the Archbishop of Canterbury\u0027s saucy reference was actually perfectly standard. It was also a wedding that broke with tradition and demonstrated several moving personal touches - and plenty of these came courtesy of the emotional and groom. Because the newly minted Duke of Sussex proved he had a romantic side over the course of the day big time. Here are the five most magical moments that prove just how in love romantic Harry is with Meghan. 1. He picked some of the flowers for her bouquet himself. We hate to generalise here, but wedding flowers tend not to be the most scintillating topic for a lot of menfolk.   But in a very sweet gesture, Harry handpicked several flowers yesterday from his and Meghan\u0027s private garden. These blooms accompanied the Forget-Me-Nots for Diana, sweet peas, lily of the valley, astilbe, jasmine and astrantia and traditional sprigs of myrtle. 2. When he kissed his bride on the steps of St George\u0027s chapel. Undoubtedly the highlight of any royal wedding, onlookers were treated to Harry and his new bride locking lips on the steps of St George\u0027s chapel. Just moments before, Meghan had whispered do we kiss now? to her new husband.  Not only that, but there was a secret kiss we missed, as besotted Harry stole a second smooch off Meghan during their carriage ride.  3. Being affectionate with Meghan while sat in church. The eyes of the world - and Her Maj - may have been on the couple, but there was no shying away from showing each other how they felt. Throughout the service, Harry could be seen stroking Meghan\u0027s thumb as they were sat down. So sweet!  4. Harry\u0027s words to his bride. It was perhaps the most famous walk down the aisle, given the debacle surrounding her father\u0027s attendance, and Harry had some tender words for Meghan as she walked up to his side.  As they stood together at the altar, he whispered, You look amazing. I\u0027m so lucky. I love you. We\u0027re not crying. YOU\u0027RE crying. 5. Pulling back her veil. Then there was the perfect fairytale moment when Harry gently pulled his bride\u0027s veil back. Cue more tears.

Dozens of social media users each day have pointed out the similarity behind ginger Prince Harry and his late mum\u0027s one-time lover, Major James Hewitt. Mr Hewitt prefers to keep out of the public eye nowadays, but has spoken out twice in the past to categorically deny being the real father of Prince Harry. During a frank and candid television interview last year, he was asked directly if he was Harry\u0027s father. Hewitt replied: No, I\u0027m not.  Pressed over why the rumours have persisted for so long, he said: It sells papers. It\u0027s worse for him [Harry] probably, the poor chap.  Hewitt began a secret affair with Diana in 1986 - which was two years after Harry, now aged 32, was born. Despite this fact, gossip mongers have continued to speculate over who Harry\u0027s father really is, given the resemblance between red-haired Hewitt and the Prince. In 2002, Hewitt told the Sunday Mirror: There really is no possibility whatsoever that I am Harry\u0027s father. I can absolutely assure you that I am not. Admittedly the red hair is similar to mine, and people say we look alike. I have never encouraged these comparisons and although I was with Diana for a long time, I must state once and for all that I\u0027m not Harry\u0027s father. When I met Diana, he was already a toddler.  It is understood Prince Charles also reassured the young Harry that he was his biological father before he started school at Eton in 1998. Supporters of Diana, including her former butler Paul Burrell, have previously spoken out in a bid to quash the rumours. And Diana’s former police bodyguard Ken Wharfe, also denied the rumours, writing: “The malicious rumours that still persist about the paternity of Prince Harry used to anger Diana greatly. “The nonsense should be scotched here and now. Harry was born on 15 September, 1984. “Diana did not meet James until the summer of 1986, and the red hair, gossips so love to cite as proof is, of course, a Spencer trait.” Hewitt and Diana began seeing each other around the same time Prince Charles was said to have begun an affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, now his second wife and the Duchess of Cornwall.  Hewitt defended his romance with the Princess, saying he could be forgiven for falling in love with her because it was so easy. Their affair was exposed five years after it started, shortly after Hewitt, a former tank commander, had served in the first Gulf War. Nowadays, the 59-year-old lives as a recluse in Dorset, but said he has no regrets about falling in love with the People\u0027s Princess. No, I don\u0027t regret that, he said last year I regret some of the things that have been caused by that but not that at all. No way.

The new Duke and Duchess of Sussex beamed with delight as they emerged from the historic church set in the grounds of Windsor Castle. At the top of the vast West Steps, where the West Door was decorated with hundreds of cream and white flowers and green foliage, Harry, 33, and his bride stopped and locked lips to the delight of cheering onlookers. Moments before, Meghan whispered do we kiss now? to her new husband. The Queen\u0027s grandson and the American former actress, 36, who is now an HRH and a member of the British royal family, said their vows in front of 600 guests including the monarch and more than 30 royals, and were watched by a global television audience of millions. Meghan wore an elegant, simple, pure white gown designed by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy, with three quarter length sleeves and open bateau neckline. Harry told his bride you look amazing, to which Meghan replied thank you as they met at the altar.  The couple tenderly held hands and exchanged smiles during the wedding ceremony. Meghan\u0027s delicate veil was five metres long and made from silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, with two of her pageboys carrying the ends as she made her way up the steps. Her hair was styled in an up do and she wore the glittering Queen Mary\u0027s Diamond Bandeau tiara, loaned to her by the Queen. The pair set off on an open-top carriage ride through the streets of Windsor where tens of thousands of well-wishers had descended on the town for the royal nuptials.  During the service, there were giggles when the Archbishop of Canterbury conducted the declarations. A loud and clear we will sounded out when the guests were asked if they would support Harry and Meghan. There were more laughs during the sermon made by preacher Michael Curry, the presiding bishop of the American Episcopal Church Bishop. He asked guests if any of them had travelled to the castle in a car, and then joked that he knew there were carriages around. Earlier, the outside crowd\u0027s cheer for the arrival of Harry and his best man William could be heard inside the chapel. Harry, looking dapper in his frockcoat uniform of the Blues and Royals, walked up towards the altar with his best man and was seen acknowledging a guest in the congregation with a nod.  Hollywood star George Clooney and his lawyer wife Amal Clooney, US talk show host Oprah Winfrey, British actor Idris Elba, tennis champion Serena Williams and Meghan\u0027s former cast mates from Suits were among the famous faces at the wedding. Other big names taking their seats were David and Victoria Beckham, and singer James Blunt. Former prime minister Sir John Major and his wife Dame Norma were also in attendance. Guests milled around before the service began, and David Beckham could be seen chatting to James Middleton, the brother of Kate - Duchess of Cambridge - in the chapel.  The Queen and Meghan\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland, sat in the same position on either side of the aisle with stellar views of the proceedings. The chapel was filled with white garden roses, peonies and foxgloves, with branches of beech, birch and hornbeam, carefully crafted by floral designer Philippa Craddock. The cascading hedgerow on the West Steps where Meghan arrived matched the glowing floral arch displays on the organ screen in the middle of the chapel - reflecting the surrounding Berkshire countryside. The groom, 33, smiled as his caught sight of his bride in her wedding dress for the first time. Meghan entered the chapel by herself before being met by the Prince of Wales. Prince Charles walked Meghan up the aisle instead of her father, Thomas Markle, who was unable to attend due to poor health. Best man Prince William supported his brother at the altar before Meghan arrived, chit-chatting between themselves as 600 guests patiently waited in their seats.  Just before Meghan arrived, the bridesmaids and pageboys were ushered in by the Duchess of Cambridge, who helped coax them into their positions with an encouraging hand on their shoulder. The children were handed flowers behind the door when one of the little bridesmaids began to cry. The Cambridges\u0027 nanny, Maria, lifted the child up to comfort her, as Prince George looked up at the tearful girl. George briefly chatted with his nanny, who helped to organise the group. Harry\u0027s niece and nephew - George and Princess Charlotte - were among the six bridesmaids and four pageboys, all aged between two and seven.  Harry\u0027s goddaughters Zalie Warren, two, and three-year-old Florence van Cutsem, Ms Markle\u0027s goddaughters, sisters Remi and Rylan Litt, aged six and seven respectively, and four-year-old Ivy Mulroney - the daughter of Meghan\u0027s close friend Jessica Mulroney - were bridesmaids. The other pageboys were Harry\u0027s six-year-old godson Jasper Dyer - the son of Harry\u0027s mentor Mark Dyer - and Mrs Mulroney\u0027s seven-year-old twin sons Brian and John Mulroney. A member of Prince Harry\u0027s household bent down to help to adjust one of the bridesmaid\u0027s dresses before their walk up the aisle.  When Meghan appeared through the doors of the chapel, sunlight streaming in behind her, she turned to smile and wave at the children who were standing to her right. Her sparkling tiara dazzled in the light of the chapel. The gaggle of children toddled up the aisle behind Meghan through the Nave, before the bride was joined by the Prince of Wales and the pair made their way down the aisle of the Quire to where Harry was waiting.  The siblings of Harry\u0027s late mother Diana, Princess of Wales were among the guests - Earl Spencer, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, who gave a reading. The uplifting sounds of a gospel choir singing the moving soul classic Stand By Me, made famous by singer Ben E King but also sung by Beatle John Lennon, was a touching moment. The choir stood at the back of the chapel and guests all turned around in their seats to take in the scene.  Some guests wanted to clap at the end, but seemed unsure about whether it was appropriate. A few moments later, at 12.40pm, Harry and Meghan were proclaimed to be husband and wife. Cheers from the crowds outside prompted a laugh from the guests in the congregation, who could hear the excitement of people in the castle grounds. Meghan spent her last night as an unmarried woman with her mum Doria Ragland at Cliveden House, roughly 10 miles from Windsor Castle. Prince Harry stayed 15 miles away at Coworth Park with William. Harry and Meghan announced their engagement to a flurry of excitement in November 2017, just days after Harry had popped the question over roast chicken.

They will promise to have and to hold, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer - and all the rest of it.  But there is one traditional promise Meghan Markle will not be making to her husband - to obey.  She\u0027s not the first royal to leave this part out of her vows - and her mother-in-law Princess Diana did the same when she married Charles back in 1981.  However she didn\u0027t start a tradition as other royal brides since, including Sarah Ferguson, decided to leave it in. But Kate Middleton wasn\u0027t having any of it and she, like many other modern brides, cut obey from her promise.  Another modern twist on the vows is that they will refer to each other as husband and wife, rather than man and wife.  The couple will also refer to each other as Harry and Meghan, the names they are known by rather than their given names - Henry and Rachel.  Apart from their names, Harry and Meghan\u0027s vows are identical.  Harry will promise:   I Harry, take you, Meghan, to be my wife, to have and to hold from this day forward for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part according to God\u0027s holy law.

It was thought Thomas Markle c ould receive his own family coat of arms as a special wedding gift . While Kensington Palace and the College of Arms declined to comment on the present, courtiers said it is a tradition unlikely not to be followed. The fathers of the Duchess of Cambridge and Sophie, the Duchess of Wessex, both received the gift when their daughters married into the royal family.  However the decision means Meghan\u0027s relations, who have been outspoken in the lead up to the royal wedding , will not be able to boast their own coat of arms, according to the Daily Mail . A source at the College of Arms told the newspaper: Mr Markle will not have his own coat of arms. We were told it would be too \u0027complicated\u0027.  Instead, the Mail claims Meghan will be given her own coat of arms, following the example of the Duchess of Gloucester, Birgitte van Deurs, who married the Duke of Gloucester, a cousin of the Queen, in 1972. For anyone to be given the distinctive heraldic bearing, they need to prove they have an ancestor who was a subject of the Crown. Mr Markle\u0027s ancestors include Mary Smith, a maid who was recorded in 1856 as working at Windsor Castle, where Meghan will be married in May.  After the family receive their coat of arms, Meghan, 36, and Prince Harry, 33, can get their own “conjugal coat of arms.  They are likely to be officially unveiled a few years after they marry. William and Kate’s made its debut in September 2013, just over two years after their April 2011 wedding.

The presiding bishop of the American Episcopal Church, was entitled The Power of Love and was a meditation on love for individuals, family and the world. It had a variety of themes including civil rights, social justice, and the transforming power of love in politics and life. He also looked at the role of bride and groom, who are set to serve their country and family. He told guests that they must harness the redemptive power of love in order to right the world\u0027s wrongs. Bishop Curry asked guests to think how governments, countries and businesses could change when love is the way. He also quoted controversial Jesuit and Roman Catholic theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, who said in his 1934 book The Evolution of Chastity that if human beings ever harness the energies of love, then for the second time in the history of the world, we will have discovered fire.   Here\u0027s the full transcript   “The Power of Love” by the Most Rev. Michael B Curry for The Marriage of HRH Prince Henry of Wales \u0026amp Ms. Meghan Markle Saturday, May 19, 2018  Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm for love is strong as death, passion fierce as the grave. Its flashes are flashes of fire, a raging flame. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. SONG OF SONGS 8:6-7  I. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said: “We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love. And when we discover that, we will be able to make of this old world a new world. Love is the only way.” There’s power in love. Do not underestimate it. Anyone who has ever fallen in love, knows what I mean. But think about love in any form or experience of it. It actually feels good to be loved, and to express love. There is something right about it. And there’s a reason. An old medieval poem says it: “Where true love is found, God himself is there.” The Bible, 1 John 4 says it this way: “Beloved, let us love one another because love is from God Everyone who loves is born of God. Whoever does not love does not know God For God is love.” (1John 4:4-8) There’s power in love. Love can help and heal when nothing else can. Love can lift up and liberate for living when nothing else will. And the love that brings two people together is the same love that can bind them together, Whether on mountaintops of happiness and through valleys of hardship. Love is strong as death It’s flashes are flashes of fire. Many waters cannot quench love Love can see you through! There’s power in love.  II But the love of which we speak is not only for couples getting married or just for interpersonal relationships. Jesus of Nazareth taught us that the way of love is the way to a real relationship with the God who created all of us, and the way to true relationship with each other as children of that one God, as brothers and sisters in God’s human family. One scholar said it this way: Jesus had founded the most revolutionary movement in human history: a movement built on the unconditional love of God for the world and the mandate to live that love. (Charles Marsh\u0027s The Beloved Community) And in so doing, to change lives and the world itself! There’s a reason. An old spiritual may suggest why: “If you cannot preach like Peter, And you cannot pray like Paul, You can tell the love of Jesus, How he died to save us all There is a balm in Gilead To make the wounded whole There is a balm in Gilead To heal the sin sick soul” “Just tell the love of Jesus, how he died to save us all.” He didn’t sacrifice his life for himself, or anything he could get out of it, He did it for others, for the other, for the good and well being of others, That’s love How does St. Paul say it? Love is not jealous, rude, or boastful. Love does not insist on its own way. Love is unselfish, sacrificial, kind and just. Love seeks the good and the well-being of the other. Love makes room and space for the other to be. (See 1 Corinthians 13:4-7) "},{"url":null,"title":"mum scarred life vicious ex","story":"NewsMum scarred for life when vicious ex-girlfriend attacked her with a shard of glass to put her fears aside and compete in beauty pageantHeidi Robinson was scarred for life by Chantelle Hayes in 2016 but will compete in Miss British Isles as she vows not to let her injuries get her down\u0026nbspShareByMirror14:17, 19 MAY 2018NewsHeidi Robinson was ‘scarred for life’ when her ex-girlfriend brutally attacked her with a shard of (Image: Heidi Robinson)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A mother who went through hell and back when her ex-girlfriend attacked her with a shard of glass will compete in a beauty pageant .  Heidi Robinson was scarred for life by Chantelle Hayes in 2016, but is refusing to let her injuries knock her confidence as she prepares to compete in Miss British Isles. The 39-year-old\u0027s injuries still cover her face, but she is determined to put it all behind her and will cover her injuries with make-up.  Heidi told the Liverpool Echo : “I’ve gone for everything this year that I never would have before what happened.   It made me a lot less scared to go for things. I didn’t have much confidence anyway because of my age and I don’t think I’m very ‘model’. I think I’m more of an actress. I’ve still got the scars, I just have to cover them up with make-up. “One’s on the side of my face so the way my hair falls I can cover it and the other one is in the middle of my head. “I’m still the same person with scars or without.  The competition requires contestants to model in a ball gown, cocktail dress and strip down to their swim wear for the bikini round - but despite the attack knocking her confidence, Heidi said she’s ready to take on the challenge. She said: “I’ve done fitness classes and stuff and I’m used to performing. I know I will be nervous.” The mother-of-one, from the Wirral, said she hopes her story will inspire others. She added: “If anyone is feeling bad about something that has happened to them, like what happened to me, or if they have been in a violent relationship then look how it can change, you know?  “Things have changed so much for me, if you take those steps to protect yourself and to stay positive and just take baby steps.” Despite coming out of a ‘volatile’ relationship with Hayes, Heidi says she’s hopeful she will be able to find love again in the future. She said: “Don’t get me wrong, it was a lot of worse than just a scar - I’ve gone through real hell and back - but I’ve not really spoken about it to many people.  “It affected my mental health and it still does now. It has really been a bad two years of my life, but I loved here, I loved her to bits.  “Now it’s turned around and I’ve come through it.

Karen Land was on the brink of death when she was given just months to live in December - but has defied all odds and is now cancer free. The mother-of-five was so unwell that she could barely climb a flight of stairs, breathe or talk without struggling. But the community came together to raise money for lifesaving immunotherapy, and combined with Karen\u0027s fighting spirit, their efforts paid off.  Scans taken on May 16 showed the disease has disappeared and there is no evidence of any cancer anywhere.    She told Lincolnshire Live: It\u0027s the best news I could have hoped for. I am now officially in remission.  I feel a bit like a walking miracle considering I was supposed to be dead by now. My consultant has said that I am one of a few people that just respond really well to treatment. She now has three weeks of radiotherapy to endure and will need a scan every three months, and there could still be a chance she will relapse in the next 12 months. Her dream job was in her grasp after she completed her firefighter training course until the terrible diagnosis came through.  She thought she would never have the chance to put her new found skills to the test in real life as a result. But that could now all change. The second best news I had was when I asked the doctor if I could return to work, she said. He said it’s not a unrealistic expectation. I’ve just got the radiotherapy to complete and a bit of work on my fitness to do. I already have a appointment to see occupational health next week so I am hoping in the next two months I can get back. Karen has even stopped donations coming into her Just Giving page. I’ve decided to end my Just Giving page for the time being and if the time comes in the future where I need treatment again or immunotherapy I will look at starting it up again, she said. She will start oxygen therapy but will use the donations or reopen the page if she needs immunotherapy in the future. Karen also spoke about the nightmarish eight months she and her family endured. Being told I had months left to live in December was the most traumatic thing I’ve ever experienced, she said. I actually got to the stage where my body was just overrun with cancer I couldn’t breath, talk and even climbing a flight of stairs was a massive task.

But I am not surprised it’s not the case. I can almost see courtiers frowning at the thought – because that isn’t protocol, that’s not how it is done.

The mouth-watering three-tier cake is thought to have been too heavy to stack the sections on top of each other. Instead the three separate tiers are resting on ornate golden goblets. The cake is being cut at the wedding reception and will be served to guests at the couple\u0027s reception. The reception is being given by the Queen at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle, with about 600 guests invited.  Approximately 7,500 items of food have been prepared by a team of 25 chefs, led by royal chef Mark Flanagan. Designed by Claire Ptak, the wedding cake features elderflower syrup made at The Queen’s residence in Sandringham from the estate’s own elderflower trees, as well as a light sponge cake uniquely formulated for the couple. A filling made from Amalfi lemon curd and elderflower buttercream tied all the elements together. The cake was decorated with Swiss meringue buttercream and 150 fresh flowers, mainly British and in season, including peonies and roses.  Ms Ptak has been assisted by a team of six other bakers, including Violet Bakery head baker Izaak Adams. The cake has been made from 200 Amalfi lemons, 10 bottles of Sandringham elderflower cordial, 20kg of butter, 20kg of sugar and 500 organic eggs from Suffolk. The inside consists of layered lemon sponge that’s been drizzled with an elderflower syrup and sandwiched using buttercream and lemon curd, while the outside has been decorated using a white buttercream made from elderflower Swiss meringue. Prince Harry and Markle have been heavily involved in the culinary process, with the lemon sponge made especially for the couple and the elderflower cordial made from elderflowers sourced from the Queen’s Sandringham estate.  “The elderflower is so quintessentially British to me as a Californian,” said Ms Ptak. “It’s a kind of ethereal, floral flavour which I think is very special, especially for a wedding.” The final appearance of the cake and its display has been kept secret until the day of the nuptials. “It’s an installation of the way that we’re putting it out. It’s the last thing that we’ll reveal, said Ms Ptak.  “It’s a non-traditional layout,” Ms Ptak continued. “It’s a slight shift from tradition.” The baker says Prince Harry and Markle - now the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - particularly like the ingenuity behind the cake’s spring design, praising its “seasonality” and “freshness”. “The buttercream is sweet and the lemon curd is very tart so you get a very lovely thing happening when you take a bite, which is to get all of these flavours and sensations perfectly balanced,” Ms Ptak explained. The cake has been decorated with a variety of flowers, including some of Markle’s personal favourites in shades of white and cream.

She arrived as her parents Carole and Michael entered the chapel alongside celebrities from around the world. The Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s sister is reportedly due to give birth sometime in October. Today she wore a green and lilac dress and floral fascinator alongside husband James Matthews. The dress was a \u0026pound495 creation by The Fold. It was a similar colour to that worn by her mother. Pippa was earlier spotted leaving Kensington in west London earlier this morning for the journey west.  It was reported last week the 34-year-old, who married James Matthews in her own May wedding last year, has been left off the invite list for the wedding reception, which will take place after the ceremony. Insiders say Harry\u0027s ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy will also miss out on the evening soiree at Frogmore House. Instead, both she and Pippa will be sent home after the formal nuptials take place in Windsor Castle.  Last month it was reported Pippa Middleton and her husband, financier James Matthews, are expecting there first child together. The couple shared the news with friends and family members, including Middleton’s big sister Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, according to reports. The couple exchanged vows back in May 2017 at a lavish ceremony at St Mark\u0027s Church, in London, attended by about 150 guests.  Before marrying, Pippa, a party-planning author, and Matthew dated briefly in 2012. A split resulted in Pippa going on to date Nico Jackson for about three years, but when that relationship ended, Middleton and Matthews officially reconnected.   The couple\u0027s baby news came one day before Kate Middleton gave birth to her third child with Prince William. Kensington Palace announced the arrival of Prince Louis on April 23.

The ginger prince is working a lot of facial hair at the moment, and many people wanted him to get rid of it all ahead of the big day. However the groom wasn\u0027t having any of it and decided to keep it as it is. People on social media have slammed his decision, saying he isn\u0027t allowed to have it while dressed in an Army uniform. But they\u0027re wrong.  As he is no longer a serving officer, Harry doesn\u0027t have to comply with the regulations. The beard also caused a big row in November when he wore a full beard with a uniform of a senior Blues and Royals officer uniform at the Remembrance Day service. British Army rules forbid all beards, except in a few rare circumstances, such as when a soldier is suffering from a skin complaint, or has strong religious reasons for retaining facial hair.          Sikhs are not allowed to cut their own hair, and can thus retain their beards while in uniform, for example. Special Forces or others on covert operations are also permitted to grow beards when behind enemy lines, but they would not wear them on parade. There is also a tradition that allows a very small number of Pioneer Sergeants to wear a beard when on official duty, but members of the Queen’s personal guard have never been allowed to do so   The Queen , Harry’s grandmother, is Colonel-in-Chief of the Blues and Royals, while the Colonel of the Regiment is Princess Anne, his aunt.  It is one of the two cavalry regiments of the Household Cavalry – the other is the Life Guards – and can trace its history back to Oliver Cromwell’s New Model Army of the 17th Century. Throughout the centuries, officers have been known for their clean-cut appearances, although some occasionally grew moustaches and connected side-whiskers, especially when serving in Muslim countries.  The Royal Navy – in which Harry ’s father, Prince Charles, served – has always been allowed beards, but officers are told to shave them off it they are not full enough.

In the same way Prince William and Kate Middleton were given a royal dukedom on their wedding morning, Harry and Meghan have been given a similar honour. Their title means the new form of address for both is Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The Queen has also conferred a Dukedom on Prince Henry of Wales. His titles will be Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. As when Kate Middleton got married, Meghan does officially become a princess today - but not in her own right. She will be HRH Princess Henry of Wales.   An official statement from Kensington Palace read: The Queen has today been pleased to confer a Dukedom on Prince Henry of Wales. His titles will be Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. Prince Harry thus becomes His Royal Highness The Duke of Sussex, and Ms. Meghan Markle on marriage will become Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex.  There has never previously been a Duchess of Sussex. The first Duke of Sussex was an eccentric son of King George III and his two marriages were deemed illegal. Prince Augustus Frederick was born in 1773 and died 1843 - and lived in Kensington Palace, which is also Meghan and Harry\u0027s home. Augustus was sent abroad and married Lady Augusta Murray - whom he called Goosy - in secret in Rome in 1793. But the marriage was declared void by George III, who had not given his approval. It was later annulled on the grounds that it contravened the Royal Marriages Act 1772. The prince became the Duke of Sussex in 1801. But Lady Augusta, from whom he separated the same year, did not become the Duchess of Sussex. She called herself princess and demanded a peerage, but never received one. Earl of Dumbarton is a title that has strong military connections. The first to hold the title was George Douglas, a younger son of the first Marquess of Douglas, who was created Earl of Dumbarton in 1675.  A Scottish nobleman and soldier, George was given the title by Charles II in recognition of his military service. When James VII of Scots (James II of England) came to the throne in 1685, the earl was made military commander in Scotland, and it is thought that when the King was deposed, George accompanied him to his court in exile in France.  On George\u0027s death at St German-en-Laye in France, the title passed to his son, also called George, who became the second Earl of Dumbarton. The title became extinct when the second earl died in 1749, meaning it has not been used in more than 260 years. It means that Prince Harry becomes the third to hold the Scottish title, and on marriage, Meghan will become Countess of Dumbarton. Dumbarton is on the north bank of the River Clyde, to the west of Glasgow.

Chefs and their assistants in the Windsor Castle kitchens will start washing and peeling vegetables in the next few days to make sure everything is perfect for the bride and groom. The pair tied the knot in Windsor today. Beforehand, hundreds speculated about what the royal couple might feed their 600 guests. Led by the Queen’s chef Mark Flanagan, the team have sourced fresh ingredients from the Home Counties and lands associated with the Queen like Windsor. Mr Flanagan said: The day of the wedding has fallen very kindly for us. “All the British vegetables are just coming into season... and that\u0027s been a point of focus for us.  We know the couple wanted us to make sure we used all of the local seasonal produce as much as possible throughout their menu, and this recent good weather is really helping us to achieve that. (For) all their decisions, we purely made suggestions and the couple... they\u0027ve tasted everything, they\u0027ve been involved in every detail... “We are using produce off Her Majesty\u0027s estates and that features very much. The sweet and savoury canapes are made to be consumed in two bites, while the bowl dishes can be eaten standing up.  Produce like asparagus, peas and tomatoes are in season. The wedding dinner is being staged at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales, with different caterers responsible for that event for 200 guests. The food is likely to be washed down with champagne and wine from the extensive royal cellars and soft drinks. The head chef would not discuss the dishes in detail but produce like asparagus, peas and tomatoes are in season - providing a wealth of options for the culinary expert who has worked for some of the world\u0027s best chefs, like Michel and Albert Roux and Raymond Blanc. In a bid to keep as many ingredients as possible British and local, Mr Flanagan\u0027s team have sourced them from the Home Counties and lands associated with the Queen like Windsor.

Royal fans immediately took to Twitter to comment on her regretful face. It looks like she\u0027s about to cry, one viewer wrote on social media.

Chelsy and Harry have stayed amicable since breaking up in 2010 after a seven-year romance. In 2011 they went to Prince William\u0027s wedding together.

Will she or won\u0027t she? To promise to obey in the vows shows tradition, humility, that a bride will submit to her husband and at no point bother herself with either a dictionary or a lawyer. To omit the word indicates that dread word feminism, the even-more dread word feisty, and also regular rows which, frankly, are in every marriage regardless of who said what. So brace yourselves, tomorrow, to hear Nicholas Witchell\u0027s opinion that was to be expected, Meghan is a very different kind of Royal, but Diana never promised to obey Charles and we all know how THAT ended, don\u0027t we Huw.  It seems like every day we await the Royal wedding is another episode of the Markle Debacle, in which things do not run according to what you\u0027d expect the palace\u0027s plans to be, and therefore a little more like a normal wedding peppered with infighting, drinking and outcast relatives. The latest mismanaged news is that the bride\u0027s father, who was going to walk her down the aisle then decided he was too embarrassing then said he would and then said he was too ill and now appears to be in hospital, is not going to do it after all. Prince Charles is going to do it instead, perhaps because if there is any role he feels comfortable in it is that of an historical anachronism. But for reasons that no-one can quite fathom he\u0027s only going to walk her halfway, with the bride abandoning her mother a the door of the church and doing the first 100 yards on her own and Chuck picking her up halfway, like a last-minute pint of milk. There are three reasons for all the confusion: the Markles all seem to hate each other, the Windsors hate each other as well as everyone else, and Meghan Markle is an independent, feminist, career woman marrying into a family where she cannot be any of those things. Of COURSE the wedding is a mess.  But therein lies any marriage\u0027s biggest risk: change. It\u0027s something that\u0027s inevitable over the course of a lifetime but most of us are resistant when asked to do it in a day. When the change is moving house, a joint bank account, or parenthood it\u0027s bad enough - imagine changing every single thing about yourself, in order to join a family that refuses, under any circumstances, to change. The Meghan we were introduced to after news broke of her romance with Harry was fun. An early starter marriage, some handsome ex-boyfriends, a role in a plot-free legal drama and social media accounts that made her accessible. We saw pictures of her drinking wine, cuddling her dogs, hanging out with celebrity friends in celebrity haunts doing celebrity things. Actual photographs of her with her father, which now seems like the last we\u0027ll ever see of THAT . Meghan the charity campaigner, Meghan the Trump-loather, Meghan who smiled because she had a nice life. And as soon as Harry and her were an item it stopped. Social media accounts were closed, all socialising was done behind closed doors, the acting and endorsements ended and one of her dogs was even abandoned with friends in Canada. She\u0027s had two trips to the supermarket nearest Kensington Palace and soon stopped doing that when she was photographed picking up a loaf of bread. Some change on the part of any Royal in-law is obviously necessary - learning protocol, lowering the hemlines, being camera-ready. But what, exactly, is Harry changing in return?  Well, presumably strip billiards, racist videos and swastika parties are now off the table. But they had been put behind him anyway, so don\u0027t really count. There have been reports he\u0027s started drinking green smoothies and going to the gym, but anyone will tell you that won\u0027t last. And there is nothing else - not one single thing - that will change for Harry as a result of being married. Yes, he\u0027ll get a wife. Maybe children. But the richer, for poorer part of the vows will forever be a private joke, his work-life balance will stay the same and the chances are he\u0027ll still be shooting birds at Sandringham on Boxing Day until, and perhaps even beyond, the point he\u0027s in a wheelchair. Meghan will learn to bow and scrape, to curtsey and hide, speak through others rather than for herself and to not put on a single ounce in weight. Harry will not learn how to deal with her family, as even now they\u0027re almost all being kept locked outside the palace gates. There is no indication he\u0027ll ever meet her father, as news of it would be on a showbiz website before the text message finished its ping. His brother William managed to blend two families together when he married. Granted, the Markles are more likely than the Middletons to steal the spoons and trip over a corgi, but the entire point of marriage is taking the rough with the smooth.  It\u0027s normal to sacrifice things when you marry. Most of us are lucky if we can limit it to sanity. But Meghan seems to have sacrificed almost everything about what and who she is, while her husband has sacrificed... biscuits? The second slice of cake? How every noble of him. Meghan could, and may still be, a modernising and humanising influence on the monarchy. Much will be made of her being able to squeeze Ben E. King and Etta James songs into the wedding music. But all her independence seems, on marriage to the Royals, have been boiled down to two songs off the iPod and some finger food. Of all that we know about Meghan before marriage - AM, if you like - that is all that remains. Meghan post-marriage may still have political opinions but is forbidden from uttering them, will still have relatives but never again speak to most of them, and when we see her smile it will be because she\u0027s on camera, and not necessarily because she\u0027s enjoying herself. Yesterday she drove to her wedding rehearsal in \u0026pound7,000 diamond earrings, and how many of those would it take for YOU to be happy as the junior partner in YOUR marriage?

Elizabeth II made her way to St George\u0027s Chapel, in Windsor, ahead of her grandson\u0027s hotly-anticipated nuptials. The 92-year-old monarch looked typically elegant in a lime green dress and hat. Prince Philip, 96, was pictured earlier this month for the time since he left King Edward VII\u0027s Hospital, in London, on April 13, following a hip operation. He walked into the chapel unaided. Their arrival came shortly after Prince Charles and Camilla arrived at the chapel. Camilla sported a large pink-coloured hat.  Philip attended the Royal Windsor Horse Show on May 11, which is held in the private grounds of Windsor Castle. But the elderly royal did not leave the Range Rover in which he was seated, choosing to remain in the driver\u0027s seat and watch the show through binoculars. The Queen was all smiles at the show and royal aides said they hoped Prince Philip would be at the wedding.  On May 4, Kensington Palace said Harry, 33, would be supported at the ceremony by his grandmother, his dad Prince Charles and his brother Prince William, who is his best man. But when asked if his grandfather Philip would be attending, an aide said: We very much hope so, adding that Buckingham Palace staff would have guidance on that closer to the time. The Queen looked splendid as she led the Windsors into Westminster Abbey for Prince William and Kate Middleton\u0027s wedding in 2011.  Adding a splash of colour to proceedings, she wore an Angela Kelly-designed single crepe wool primrose dress with hand-sewn beading at the neck in the shape of sunrays. Over this, she wore a matching double crepe wool tailored primrose coat. Angela Kelly designed the Queen\u0027s matching hat too, which was handmade with silk roses and apricot-coloured leaves. The Queen also wore Queen Mary\u0027s True Lovers Knot diamond brooch.

Royal Zara Tindall was among many inside St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor who looked a little surprised as Bishop Curry went to work. We\u0027re going to sit down, we gotta get y\u0027all married! he told Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and their wedding guests. Later he said: Two young people fell in love and we all showed up. As he got into full swing, Sky News journalist Mark Austin said: Lovely moment as the preacher takes the Royals to the edge of their comfort zone  BBC presenter Jeremy Vine said: The preacher is doing 50 in a 30 zone and it\u0027s brilliant. Bishop Curry, 65, is the presiding bishop of the American Episcopal Church.  Bishop Curry is based in Raleigh, North Carolina, - but today he went global. Giving an address titled the Power of Love at the service, the Chicago native opened his energetic speech with the words of Martin Luther King, a devout Christian whose faith shaped his struggle against racial injustice in the US, hailing his views on love as right. We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love. And when we discover that, we will be able to make of this old world a new world. Love is the only way, Bishop Curry quoted.      US ABC News anchor T.J. Holmes said: I\u0027m from West Memphis ... and my wedding wasn\u0027t even this black. I\u0027ve learned in my life that anytime a black pastor says I\u0027m wrapping up ... you should get comfortable. But take your time, Mr. Curry. I\u0027m loving this. Radio 1 DJ Matt Edmondson said: SOMEONE GIVE THIS MAN HIS OWN TV SHOW IMMEDIATELY.  Pop star Danni Minogue said: Windsor is waiting. Piers Morgan tweeted: OK, Rev... you need to wrap. One royal reporter noted: This is brilliant from Bishop Curry - some amazing facial expressions all around! Ed Miliband tweeted: Rev Michael Curry could almost make me a believer.      Princess Beatrice and Eugenie were both also seen smiling. We\u0027re going to sit down, we gotta get y\u0027all married! The Mirror reported last week how Bishop Curry is to march on the White House against Donald Trump four days after the wedding today. Bishop Curry will join a Washington protest over what he calls the president’s “dangerous” leadership.     The first African-American to be primate of the Episcopal Church – a US offshoot of the Church of England – he has branded Trump’s America First policy “a theological heresy for the followers of Christ”. And the Most Rev Bishop Curry has also previously blasted a “crisis of moral and political leadership at the highest levels of our government”.     His invitation came months after the Royal Family confirmed Mr Trump would not be invited to the wedding. Described as a stunning preacher by Archbishop Justin Welby the 65-year-old certainly grabs your attention. The bishop, from Chicago, has previously backed gay marriage and transgender rights. In his autobiography he revealed his parents were descended from slaves and sharecroppers.   He was ordained as a deacon in June 1978. He became the first black presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church in 2015. The Episcopal bishop\u0027s role in the service today was seen as a nod to the actress\u0027s US roots as she married into the British royal family.  Meghan was born in Los Angeles, California, to an African-American mother and was baptised into the Anglican Church ahead of her wedding to Prince Harry. The Episcopal Church is the US offshoot of the Church of England and forms part of the broader Anglican Communion. The bishop\u0027s words rose in a passionate crescendo as he spoke of the link between love and the divine, his style a stark contrast to the sober delivery of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was officiating.For the royal family, the animated performance would be a departure from the type of sermons they normally see at church services.  The wide-ranging address cited love as the key to curing global problems such as poverty. Love can help and heal when nothing else can. There\u0027s power in love to lift up and liberate when nothing else will. Such power could be seen in the service, he continued, saying: Two young people fell in love and we all showed up. In a moment of light self-deprecation, Bishop Curry noted he had to soon sit down, gesturing to the couple and adding we need to get y\u0027all married. The ideas of French thinker Pierre Teilhard de Chardin were called upon as the bishop brought his address to a powerful conclusion.

Gospel group The Kingdom Choir will perform the singer’s Stand By Me, along with Etta James’s version of Amen/This Little Light of Mine. And the couple’s modern spin on a royal wedding also takes in very contemporary vows. Meghan will not promise to “obey” when she marries her prince today at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, and the couple will be pronounced as “husband and wife” rather than “man and wife”. They will also refer to each other as “Harry” and “Meghan” as they say their vows, using the names they are known by rather than their given names – and not including middle or surnames. However, there will still be nods to royal tradition, with classical pieces being played while their 600 guests are taking their seats and a rendition of the national anthem at the end.  And there is a poignant tribute to Harry’s tragic mum Princess Diana with the inclusion of the hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer – which was played at her 1997 funeral. William and Kate also included the hymn at their 2011 wedding. A spokesman said Harry and Meghan have “taken a great deal of care in selecting all elements for their service”. He added: “This has been a collaborative effort led by Prince Harry and Ms Markle. They have also sought the advice of the Prince of Wales for the orchestral music before the service begins.” The five organ pieces and seven orchestral pieces that will be played as guests arrive include Ralph Vaughan Williams’s Fantasia on Greensleeves, which William and Kate also chose for their big day.  The orchestra, made up of musicians from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, the English Chamber Orchestra and the Philharmonia, will also play pieces by Elgar and Holst. The bride will arrive to a fanfare from the trumpeters of the Household Cavalry then walk down the aisle – where she will be met halfway by Prince Charles – to the sound of Welsh soprano Elin Manahan Thomas singing Handel’s Eternal Source of Light Divine. An order of service to be given to the 600 guests has an introduction taken from Common Worship, which reads: “A wedding is one of life’s great moments, a time of solemn commitment as well as good wishes, feasting and joy.  “Marriage is intended by God to be a creative relationship, as his blessing enables husband and wife to love and support each other in good times and bad, and to share in the care and upbringing of children.” The 20-page service was printed before the couple knew Meghan’s dad Thomas would not be able to attend, so his name is included in the order.   The service they have chosen is from the Marriage Service from Common Worship and features contemporary language – using the word “you” instead of “thee” and “thou”, and offering the most flexibility in the choice of readings and prayers. While the couple are signing the register, 19-year-old cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason will perform three pieces with the orchestra. Recent royal tradition has been for brides not to pledge to obey their husbands. Kate did not in 2011 and neither did Diana in 1981 when she married Charles. But the Queen and her sister Margaret did, as did the Countess of Wessex in 1999. Harry and Meghan wanted Diana’s family to play a role so her sister, Lady Jane Fellowes, will deliver a reading from the Song of Solomon, which stresses the strength and power of love. The service will be led by the Right Reverend David Conner, Dean of Windsor, and Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will officiate as the couple say their vows.  They will also greet the Royal Family as they arrive at the Galilee Porch from 11.25am. Harry and best man William will arrive at 11.40am and greet charity guests outside before entering the chapel as the congregation stands. The Queen is the last to arrive before the bride and will be taken to her seat in the Quire. The chapel was closed to the public yesterday as last-minute preparations were made. London florist Philippa Craddock and her team were decorating the chapel with white roses, foxgloves and Meghan’s favourite peonies, as well as branches of birch, beech and hornbeam. Meanwhile, Windsor town centre was teaming with tourists and fans of the royals waving flags, many preparing to sleep out on the streets to get the best spots for the big day.  Barriers were in place along the procession route with crowds of up to 100,000 expected. Some 5,000 media workers from around the world will broadcast the celebrations to an estimated billion-strong audience. And police were creating a “ring of steel” around Windsor Castle in one of Thames Valley’s biggest operations to date. Armed officers and sniffer dogs have been patrolling the area. Metal barriers have been put up in the Berkshire town to prevent potential attackers from using vehicles, as in the terrorist atrocities committed on London Bridge and Westminster Bridge in the capital.  Police have even asked people not to throw confetti, tweeting: “Please do not throw confetti or any other items at any time during the day, particularly during the procession. “It poses a potential security risk and it’s a bit of a pain to clean up! We hope everyone enjoys the day.” "},{"url":null,"title":"royal wedding day 2018 live","story":"NewsRoyal Wedding Day 2018: Live updates as Meghan Markle and Prince Harry celebrate at reception packed with 600 guestsThe royal couple - who were today named Duke and Duchess of Sussex - kissed on the steps of St George\u0027s chapel to the delight of crowds\u0026nbspShareByNatalie EvansJoshua TaylorAssistant news editorUpdated16:33, 19 MAY 2018News\u0026nbspShareVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowMeghan Markle and Prince Harry sealed their love with a kiss after being declared husband and wife.

The preface The Dean of Windsor reads: “In the presence of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit,we have come together to witness the marriage of Henry Charles Albert David and Rachel Meghan, to pray for God’s blessing on them, to share their joy and to celebrate their love. “Marriage is a gift of God in creation through which husband and wife may know the grace of God. It is given that as man and woman grow together in love and trust, they shall be united with one another in heart, body and mind, as Christ is united with his bride, the Church. The gift of marriage brings husband and wife together in the delight and tenderness of sexual union and joyful commitment to the end of their lives. “It is given as the foundation of family life in which children are born and nurtured and in which each member of the family, in good times and in bad, may find strength, companionship and comfort, and grow to maturity in love. “Marriage is a way of life made holy by God and blessed by the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ with those celebrating a wedding at Cana in Galilee. Marriage is a sign of unity and loyalty which all should uphold and honour. It enriches society and strengthens community. “No one should enter into it lightly or selfishly but reverently and responsibly in the sight of almighty God. “Harry and Meghan are now to enter this way of life. They will each give their consent to the other and make solemn vows, and in token of this they will each give and receive a ring. “We pray with them that the Holy Spirit will guide and strengthen them, that they may fulfil God’s purposes for the whole of their earthly life together. All stand. Hymn: Lord of all Hopefulness Lord of all Hopefulness, Lord of all joy, Whose trust, ever child-like, no cares could destroy, Be there at our waking, and give us, we pray, Your bliss in our hearts, Lord, at the break of the day. Lord of all eagerness, Lord of all faith, Whose strong hands were skilled at the plane and the lathe, Be there at our labours, and give us, we pray, Your strength in our hearts, Lord, at the noon of the day. Jan Struther (1901–53) ‘Slane’, Traditional Irish Melody Declarations All remain standing as the Archbishop leads the Declarations: “First, I am required to ask anyone present who knows a reason why these persons may not lawfully marry, to declare it now.” The Archbishop says to the couple: “The vows you are about to take are to be made in the presence of God, who is judge of all and knows all the secrets of our hearts therefore if either of you knows a reason why you may not lawfully marry, you must declare it now.” The Archbishop says to the bridegroom: “Harry, will you take Meghan to be your wife? Will you love her, comfort her, honour and protect her, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to her as long as you both shall live?” He answers: “I will.” The Archbishop says to the bride: “Meghan, will you take Harry to be your husband? Will you love him, comfort him, honour and protect him, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to him as long as you both shall live? She answers: “I will”. The Archbishop says to the congregation: “Will you, the families and friends of Harry and Meghan, support and uphold them in their marriage now and in the years to come?” All answer: “We will”. The collect THE Archbishop invites the people to pray, silence is kept and he says the Collect: “God our Father, from the beginning you have blessed creation with abundant life. “Pour out your blessings upon Harry and Meghan, that they may be joined in mutual love and companionship, in holiness and commitment to each other. “We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son, who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen. All sit. Reading From the Song of Solomon, read by The Lady Jane Fellowes from the Nave. “My beloved speaks and says to me: ‘Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone. The flowers appear on the earth the time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land. “The fig tree puts forth its figs, and the vines are in blossom they give forth fragrance. “Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm for love is strong as death, passion fierce as the grave. “Its flashes are flashes of fire, a raging flame. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. “If one offered for love all the wealth of one’s house, it would be utterly scorned.” If Ye Love Me All remain seated while the Choir of St George’s Chapel sing the Motet, If Ye Love Me. IF ye love me, keep my commandments, and I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another comforter, that he may ‘bide with you forever, e’en the spirit of truth.

No, I won’t be afraid. Oh, I won’t be afraid, Just as long as you stand, stand by me. So darling, darling, stand by me, Oh, stand by me. Oh stand, stand by me. Stand by me. If the sky that we look upon, Should tumble and fall, Or the mountain should crumble to the sea. I won’t cry, I won’t cry. No, I won’t shed a tear. Just as long as you stand, stand by me, Darling, darling, stand by me... Whenever you’re in trouble, Won’t you stand by me, oh stand by me. Oh stand, stand by me. Stand by me.

The celebs arrived, then the royals began to filter in, then we had the groom, best man and, finally, Meghan making a breathtaking entrance in her stunning Givenchy gown. So far, so royal wedding .   Surprisingly, it was the vicar who prompted the smirks - and even got Victoria Beckham to finally crack a smile. Buy the man a beer!   During the first 30 seconds of the opening prayers, archbishop Justin Welby made reference to Harry and Meghan\u0027s sexual union.  Specifically, the delight \u0026amp tenderness of sexual union.   And EVERYONE picked up on it.          But there\u0027s a perfectly simple explanation for the vicar\u0027s words. This is a royal wedding after all. The inclusion of the words sexual union is all part and parcel of a Church of England wedding ceremony ans features in the preface (or opening prayers).      The gift of marriage brings husband and wife together in the delight and tenderness of sexual union and joyful commitment to the end of their lives. It is given as the foundation of family life in which children are [born and] nurtured and in which each member of the family,in good times and in bad, may find strength, companionship and comfort, and grow to maturity in love.

They will be known as Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Sussex , the Earl and Countess of Dumbarton and Baron and Baroness Kilkeel - catchy.  The Baroness Kilkeel is a brand new Irish title, but the other two have been used before. Prince Harry is only the second Duke of Sussex and the original was Prince Augustus Frederick. Born in 1773, Prince Augustus was university educated and campaigned for the abolition of slavery.  But he had a very difficult love life. Like Harry, he didn\u0027t marry for titles or rank but for love. He married twice, but his father George III didn\u0027t approve of either and ruled they were unlawful. He married his first wife Lady Augusta Murray in 1793 in Rome but his dad ruled it void using the Royal Marriages Act. This meant the couple\u0027s two children Augustus and Augusta were not considered heirs to his title.  They separated in 1801. Prince Augustus then married Lady Cecilia Letitia Buggin in 1831, but his father did exactly the same thing.  This means Meghan Markle will officially be the first Duchess of Sussex.  Harry and Meghan will tie the knot at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle today. After the ceremony they will take a carriage ride around the town before heading back to the castle for two receptions.  Follow our live blog for all the details from the happy day.

The teenager got a personal phone invite to perform at St George\u0027s Chapel by Meghan Markle and Prince Harry - now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.  The congregation listened in silence as he gave a graceful performance of three pieces, accompanied by an orchestra, while Prince Harry and Meghan signed the register in private and away from the public.  Sheku (it’s pronounced Shay-ku, not Shekku or She-ku) performed Franz Schubert \u0027s Ave Maria, Gabriel Faur\u0026eacute\u0027s Apr\u0026egraves un r\u0026ecircve and Maria Theresia von Paradis\u0027 Sicilienne.  The 19-year-old was crowned BBC Young Musician of the Year in 2016 - the first black musician to win the award - and is from Nottinham.  As well as being in the running for the title of Male Artist Of The Year alongside opera’s leading man Jonas Kaufmann, modern composer Max Richter, Pointless host Alexander Armstrong and Britain’s Got Talent 2017 winner Tokio Myers, Sheku has also scored a top 20 record with his debut album Inspiration. Indeed Sheku, who is a former student of Trinity School in Nottingham, was rubbing shoulders with the likes of pop megastars Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran when he entered the official UK charts at number 18 (as well as topping the classical chart). Now studying at the Royal Academy of Music, in London, the Mapperley musician has not forgotten his roots and made a return to his old Roman Catholic academy at the start of this year to gift \u0026pound3,000 to the school (matched by another \u0026pound3,000 from his record label Decca) to help safeguard music tuition at the institute.  Achieving so much at such a young age takes some hard work of course with the youngster needing to practise for at least five hours a day: two in the morning, two in the evening, and one or two in the middle of the day. Despite this he still finds time to support his beloved Arsenal though while also hitting the pitch himself as he plays as a creative midfielder in the Royal Academy of Music side. Never far from his side, although not on the football pitch, is the other half of the Sheku show - the 400-year-old Amati cello, which is on lifetime loan from dealer and restorer Florian Leonhard Fine Violins (London and New York).

Merryn Crofts, 21, weighed less than six stone and spent the last three years of her life totally bed-bound with severe ME - an incurable condition that affects 250,000 people in the UK. The youngster was unable to take more than two teaspoons of food before suffering immense gut pain and vomiting, a coroner was told. Merryn, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester. today became only the second person in the UK to have ME - myalgic encephalomyelitis - listed on a death certificate. Despite being classed as a real neurological disease, many think the condition is not real - some even within the medical profession. Merryn\u0027s mum, Clare Norton, sobbed as she told Rochdale Coroner\u0027s Court how her beautiful and energetic daughter was left wheelchair-bound and reliant on tube feeding.  She said: As a child, she was a bundle of energy. She didn\u0027t walk anywhere - she would hop, skip and jump. She was the kind of person that people gravitated towards. They wanted to be her friend. She was very social and loved drama. She was a total fashionista, a typical teenager. Her bedroom was a mess of clothes, hairspray and tan. But she was also stubborn and I think that helped her cope with her illness in a lot of ways. She never gave up. In August 2011, Merryn, then 15, was diagnosed with hives and swelling shortly after coming back from a family holiday in Mallorca. Tests in early 2012 revealed that at some point she had contracted glandular fever - a virus which can trigger ME. Despite dozens of medical appointments - including mental health checks for panic attacks - Merryn\u0027s condition deteriorated as she suffered breathing problems, exhaustion and excruciating hypersensitivity to touch, light and sound. She was eventually diagnosed with ME in the summer of 2012. The would-be theatre star, who was forced to wear an eye mask, also suffered from severe migraines, brain fog, slurred speech and persistent infections. Stomach problems, and problems swallowing, meant that her weight plummeted to just five-and-a-half stone.  Coroner Katherine McKenna was told that Merryn could take on just 100 calories a day because her gut was in so much pain, and that, by 2015, even two teaspoons of nutrients were intolerable. Merryn was eventually fitted with an intravenous nutrition line but suffered intestinal failure and was given a terminal diagnosis in 2016.. She died on May 23, 2017, just days after her 21st birthday. Mrs McKenna today concluded her cause of death as starvation caused by a withdrawal of supportive nutriition, caused by ME. She described Merryn as someone who bore her suffering with dignity and good grace. She said: Merryn had suffered with ME since 2012 which caused severe fatigue, gastointestinal failure, chronic pain, global hypersensitivity, loss of mobility and function. Despite extensive investigations no reason for her gastrointestinal failure which led to her reliance on supportive nutriton was found and it most likely it was caused by her ME. Mum Clare, who attended the inquest with daughter Amy Williams and Merryn\u0027s stepdad Dave Norton, told of her long-standing belief that ME contributed to her death. She said: With ME the key symptom is post-exertional malaise. That means if someone\u0027s energy is pushed beyond what they can tolerate, it will trigger all of their symptoms. The best advice we were given was for Merryn to do just 50% of what she felt capable of. But Merryn didn\u0027t even have 50% to give. She was always crashing, so everything that happened to her kept pushing her further behind.  Pathologist Daniel DuPlessis said that a post-mortem showed low-grade inflammation of nerve roots. It was suggested that this inflammation could have made her bowel hypersensitive to processing nutrients. Dr DuPlessis pointed out that Merryn had inflammation of the ganglia - gatekeepers to sensations in the brain. A post-mortem into the only other UK death attributed to ME, Sophia Mirza, 32, in 2006, also found ganglionitis. ME expert at Salford Royal hospital, Dr Annice Mukherjee, said she was convinced that the illness was responsible for triggering Merryn\u0027s intestinal failure. She said: I haven\u0027t come across a case of ME with life-threatening malnutrition before but I have come across many patients with severe ME that are bedbound that have global sensitivity issues and severe gut issues. But every single patient with ME is different, so I never see the same case twice. The ME Association is at the forefront of improving access to care, treatment and research and removing the disease\u0027s stigma. The charity today called for Merryn\u0027s death not to be in vain. A spokesman said: Firstly, the sympathies of the ME Association are with Merryn’s family today. We hope the result of this inquest provides some closure and allows them to cherish their memories of Merryn. It is essential that Merryn\u0027s untimely death is not overlooked and the urgent need for proper recognition of, and research into, ME is recognised. In our present state of knowledge, we don\u0027t know if ME can kill directly, but there are various consequences of having the illness that can increase the risk of early death. What we do know is this: ME is real. It’s devastating. It leaves people, at best, struggling to work. At worst, it leaves them enduring a tortuous existence, a living death, where they are unable to take their place in society.  One in four are so severely affected that they are housebound, bedbound, and in some cases unable to shower, clothe, or feed themselves. People are taking their lives because they cannot bear the torture this illness brings. Others describe themselves as rotting behind closed curtains. Despite being recognised as a neurological disease, many doctors still don’t know how to diagnose and manage ME/CFS and lack or research means that we still don’t have any effective forms of treatment. This is a completely unacceptable situation for a disease costing the UK economy around \u0026pound3.5billion in lost taxes, healthcare and benefit costs. There is no cure - and the longer it will take to find one unless funding dramatically increases. How many more people have to suffer before ME merits properly funded medical research? Merryn, who loved acting, had dreams of attending a performing arts school in Liverpool and adored musical theatre like Billy Elliott and Wicked. Mental health expert, Dr Ross Overshott, told the inquest that Merryn did not suffer a psychological illness, such as depression or an eating disorder. He said: She was hopeful for the future, she could speak in a very involved way about her hobbies and interests, particularly musicals and films. Before she died, Merryn revealed that she wanted her brain and spinal column to be donated to ME research. They were donated to the ME Association\u0027s Ramsay Research Fund, which conducts research into the causes of the disease.

His lifeless body was found hanged in his room on September 17, 2001, alongside a note that read: “Suicide. The unknown man, described as tall and dark, had checked using an assumed name and left few identifying clues.  An envelope stuffed with with $160 (\u0026pound118) of cash was also found with a message indicating the money was “for the room.” Media coverage of his death speculated possible links to the 9/11 hijackers, due in part to his ‘Middle Eastern’ appearance. The unusual cold case has be central to numerous online conspiracy theories for over a decade. Some speculated that the “John Doe” was part of a team of 19 hijackers whose suicide attacks on New York\u0027s Twin Towers claimed the lives of 3,000 people.  Some thought that he could be a spy or a cult member – as DNA traces initially failed to determine his identity. Those theories have now proved to be false thanks to painstaking forensic work by the non-profit DNA Doe Project organisation.  A team of 20 volunteers spent hundreds of hours running his DNA through a genealogy database in the hope they could discover close genetic matches. The team was eventually able to narrow down the location of his family to Almeda County, California.  “In the end, all the DNA matches and all the family trees and all the research paid off. This took persistence, good solid genealogy and detective work”, a Facebook post by the organisation said. Users of Redddit were instrumental in solving the case. 4,000 of their members scoured web groups in the hope that they would be able to trigger the memories of at least one person who could help. It was also those members who first notified DNA Doe Project about Stevik.  Sadly, the real name of Stevik will not be released to the public out of respect to the privacy of his grieving family. His relatives had assumed that he was still alive and had been avoiding them for decades until they were informed of his death. The dead man was also not from a Middle Eastern background but was in fact a mix of Hispanic and native American.

Mary Kinninmonth, director of Dundee’s Citizens Advice Bureau, said UC’s online system hampers less computer-literate claimants.She said: “The main things we see are people still having difficulty in making and managing online claims due to lack of confidence and/or knowledge of computer skills.“The helpline is also very difficult to get through to with long waiting times.“Even though the waiting time has reduced, there is still a waiting time – which will often mean people going into rent arrears.”Full service UC rolled out in Dundee in November, following a trial period for new single applicants.The number of Universal Credit issues dealt with by Dundee CAB has risen by almost 50% following the introduction of the full service.Dundee City Council gives UC claimants a reprieve over their arrears, acknowledging the delayed payouts the DWP makes from month to month.A spokesman for the authority said a £250,000 hardship fund for council tenants was created in April 2016, boosted to £450,000 for this year.He added: “We continue to do a considerable amount work to support tenants on Universal Credit.“If a tenant is having difficulties paying their rent a referral to the Council Advice Service is made. Staff there can offer help and assistance.”A spokeswoman for the DWP said claimants can receive advance payments if required from day one.She added: “We have removed the seven-day waiting period from new claims and pay people’s Housing Benefit for two weeks while they wait for their first full Universal Credit payment.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/PA-28105789-843x564.jpg ","title":"dundee announce signing of french midfielder","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have announced the signing of a French midfielder.Elton Ngwatala has penned a deal at Dens Park and is Neil McCann\u0026#8217s first signing of the summer.The Dark Blues have snapped up the 24-year-old attacking player on a two-year deal despite interest from down south.Ngwatala previously played for Kidderminster Harriers in two spells at the National League North side.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afc0094a37a7-e1526475640876-928x564.jpg ","title":"dundee boss neil mccann admits hes made mistakes but looks to learn from them","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann says he had higher targets for his team this past season but insists an early start can get the Dark Blues where he wants them to be this time next year.A ninth-placed finish in the Premiership fell short of his stated top-half aim but Neil insists he learned a lot from his debut campaign as a manager.He said: “I think you have to self-analyse.“I’ve made mistakes, as a young manager I think that’s normal but, hopefully, if you’re learning from those it will put you in a better position next season.“In terms of going into the last five games, I learned a lot from my squad.“There was huge pressure going into the Hamilton game.“We knew it could have been a total role reversal and our goal difference was poorer so we knew the risk we were playing under but the players were brave and in it together.“That’ll help me 100% next season.

They had used an orange survival bag over an old duvet, sticking their head in under the old fireplace for cover and placing their feet in a thermal shopping bag for warmth.”Gareth said that on Wednesday night the charity helped two women who needed medical attention.He added: “Our outreach patrol was kept busy that evening as we gave out lots of hot chocolate drinks, made two new street friends, issued two sleeping bags, cleansed and dressed one girl’s self-harming wounds on both her lower arms and transported another female street beggar to A\u0026ampE.”On May 12 Gareth said the team gave hot drinks to two homeless people who were sheltering in a church foyer.Five days earlier he helped a 47-year-old Jamaican man sleeping on a bench in Riverside Drive who was heading north.“We were able to supply him with a sleeping bag, hot drinks and advice and directed him to more suitable sheltered location,” he said.Gareth said that, the day before, he had spoken with three rough sleepers who told him they had been refused assistance from the authorities.Mike Cordiner, of the Eagles Wings Trust, said: “There seems to be a rise in the number of people coming to Dundee from other areas. I am aware of someone from Jamaica and a person from Poland currently sleeping rough in Dundee.“If you come from outwith the city the authorities do not find you somewhere to sleep.“This needs to change.”A council spokeswoman said: “We understand that being homeless is difficult and traumatic and our aim is to offer a service that is sympathetic as well as meeting our statutory duties.“When we

The police are never out of there,” she said.“Why are they creating a new community campus and putting this right smack bang in the middle?‘‘It’s disgraceful.”Tom Henney, who drew up a petition against the custody unit, said he wasn’t opposed to the SPS proposals.‘‘My opinion is still the same – nobody has any objection to what they’re trying to do but there are other areas better suited for this,” he said.“My biggest concern is if (offenders) get out.‘‘There are drugs, there is crime and it shouldn’t be here.”However, Ann Hutchison, 57, who lives two minutes from Our Lady’s, said she was “keeping an open mind” on the plans.She added: “I’m glad the prison service are out speaking to the community. They should be.”Councillors were also in attendance at the information session, but couldn’t comment directly on the proposals as they are yet to come through the planning system.The SPS’s Tom Fox said it was inevitable that locals were concerned, but added: “Most of these are based on ideas of something that this unit isn’t.‘‘It is not a prison.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afe9ae43941b-846x564.jpg ","title":"thousands across dundee celebrate ramadan and locals invited to join evening meal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThousands of Muslims in Dundee have started celebrating the holy month of Ramadan – and locals are being invited to take part to find out more about the festival.Ramadan takes place in the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and commemorates the first revelation of the Koran to Muhammad.Bashir Chohan, head of Dundee Islamic Society, said that as of Thursday, Muslims from 13 nationalities across the city were observing the event.Mr Chohan said: “It is an important event in the Muslim calendar and involves a period of fasting for the next 30 days.“We fast from dawn until dusk when we are allowed to begin eating again.“I have my first meal of the day at 9.30pm when we usually begin eating with a selection of snacks.“We eat all sorts of food at this time from east and west and often begin with a cold drink or a milkshake.”Mr Chohan explained that fasting was for adults with children beginning to take part from the age of about 10-12.He said: “It is up to children and their families to decide when the children can cope with fasting.”Mr Choham said that at night, following the breaking of the fast, Muslims would be going along to the five mosques in the city to pray.“We listen to the Imam reciting from the Koran for an hour and we say special prayers,” he said.“And while at the mosque we serve around 300 to 400 meals a night to visitors.”During Ramadam, Mr Chohan said that Muslims were also expected to be on their best behaviour at all times.“Of course we should always be on our best behaviour but it is particularly important during Ramadan,” he said.“Ramadan is a very spiritual time for us. It is a peaceful time and an opportunity to repair body and soul.“We eat for the rest of the year and it is an order from God to obey his rules and take part in fasting and prayer during Ramadan.”Mr Chohan said that, as always, he would welcome Dundee residents to visit the mosques during Ramadan.He said: “Anyone is welcome to visit our mosques and take part in what is happening during the month.“We would be delighted for people to come along and see what we do and take part if they so wish.“Women as well as men are very welcome to attend. We are happy to share our religious beliefs and traditions with everyone in Dundee.”Ramadan began this year on May 15 and will end on Thursday June 14.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Times Past  Looking back at life Doon the Watter","story":"                          Evocative Images from the Archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"Celtic fans rush to buy new    Only the Bold    home kit ahead of Scottish Cup final","story":"                          CELTIC\u0026rsquoS new 2018/19 home kit has hit stores - and supporters can\u0026rsquot get enough of it ahead of the big Scottish Cup final on Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"Neil Lennon  Tom Rogic signing shows Celtic mean business","story":"                          Neil Lennon believes the new deal signed by \u0026ldquoiconic Tom Rogic shows that Celtic mean business as the Parkhead club look to make Scottish football history tomorrow."},{"url":null,"title":"New footbridge is a link across the River Clyde","story":"                          A 130 metre lifted the five giant beams making up the base of Polmadie Bridge."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7805194.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"National silence to mark anniversary of Manchester Arena atrocity","story":"                          A national one-minute silence will be held on the anniversary of the Manchester Arena atrocity to remember the 22 people who lost their lives."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7786603.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Prince Harry and bride-to-be Meghan Markle make final wedding preparations","story":"                          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are making final wedding preparations on their last day before becoming husband and wife."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7362756.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Justin Timberlake CANCELS one Glasgow show and reschedules another","story":"                          MUSIC star Justin Timberlake has cancelled one of his upcoming Glasgow shows."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7777769.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Football on TV  Where to watch Celtic v Motherwell  Chelsea v Manchester United and more","story":"                          THE time has almost come for Celtic and Motherwell to do battle for the final major honour in Scotland this season."},{"url":null,"title":"Glasgow animal charity seeking new homes for four very unusual puppies","story":"                          The team at Dogs Trust Glasgow are appealing for homes for some of their quirkiest ever residents."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7807458.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Alex Salmond  Nicola Sturgeon    ready for BBC bias    in next Scottish independence referendum","story":"                          NICOLA Sturgeon will not underestimate the alleged bias of the BBC when the next independence referendum is called, Alex Salmond has said."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7807902.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Public consultation to open next week on   9m plans for Byres Road","story":"                          A PUBLIC consultation on design proposals for the future of Byres Road will begin next week.

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good.

Backers also emphasised that if Inverness spurned the project the funding would simply go elsewhere in Scotland.The local authority\u0027 Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"It is in development and about to be revealed to the public.\"I\u0026rsquom confident the new proposal will prove a big hit for the city.
