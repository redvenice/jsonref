Her debut novel, My Name Is Leon, was shortlisted for the Costa first novel award while her second, The Trick to Time, was longlisted for the Women’s prize for fiction. She has also written Becoming Dinah for young adults, and edited Common People, an anthology of working-class writers. In 2019, she was part of the BBC panel creating the 100 Novels That Shaped Our World list, and recently co-created an online literary festival, the Big Book Weekend, in association with the BBC and Arts Council England. De Waal’s new book, Supporting Cast, is a collection of short stories featuring the lives of secondary characters from her previous two novels.What made you want to write these stories?All of the characters that I write – even before I sit down to write – have a life beyond the page. They’re not waiting in the wings to walk on. They’re off living their own life, and then they’re in my book, and then go off to live the rest of their life. Nobody’s a secondary character in their own life, but some people skirt around the edges of a party and I always think they’re undoubtedly the most interesting. I had most definitely not finished with these characters.A number of these stories are about female loneliness. Why is that a recurrent theme?Until you said it, I had no idea. Maybe it’s a function of thinking about My Name Is Leon and A Trick to Time, which both have very damaged women in them. Maybe it’s because I got orced five years ago and I’m on my own.Cultural dislocation is another strong theme. Is all writing for you, to a greater or lesser extent, about the search for identity?Yes, completely. I think it’s because I have so many overlapping and disparate identities: being black and white being from two colonised countries, St Kitts and Ireland being brought up a Jehovah’s Witness. I was born working-class, but I now live a very middle-class life. I feel like a whole person but I can definitely see that there are things in me that belong in different places.One of your characters dies as a result of police brutality. How does it feel having themes you’ve been engaging with for a long time now at the centre of public discourse?It’s both intensely irritating and also gratifying. It’s irritating because I’ve been working on anti-racist stuff in one capacity or another since I was 23 and I’m 60 in a month’s time. So it’s a long, bloody road where we – black people – have been saying this is going on. And it takes another horrendous death for people to appear to take it seriously. It’s gratifying that finally I really do believe something has changed. I do believe this is different. It feels more real, people’s responses feel more genuine, and I do have hope that things will move forward an inch.Are you confident it will change the publishing landscape?I think things have been changing for a while, to widen the scope of what is published by whom. I still think it’s up to people on the outside to agitate, and people on the inside to think about change. I don’t think it’s going to happen if we take our foot off the gas.You set up an online literary festival in response to lockdown. Do you think that might be a way of increasing access to a more erse audience at literary events?Absolutely. We had 24,000 people come to the Big Book Weekend and we had hundreds of people in the chatrooms saying they’d never go to a literary festival: they’re too expensive, they’re too far away, they wouldn’t know where to sit, they wouldn’t know what to wear. I think it would give them the confidence to go to an actual festival. So I think there’s a bit of cross-pollination and there’s space for both.Did you have a lot of exposure to books and literature as a child?I had zero exposure that wasn’t at school. I had to read the Bible and remember whole chunks of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes and I’d been so turned off by that, it wasn’t until I was in my 20s that I started reading.So which book would you give to a young person today?My son has severe dyslexia so he never read at all, and I discovered audiobooks. So I would probably give a young person a Philip Pullman novel read by Michael Sheen. For any child who’s just a bit insecure about their reading – or just want a different experience from sitting and turning the pages – I think audiobooks are fabulous.Which writers have most influenced your own writing?I’m massively influenced by the classics because that’s what I started reading. I only read the classics for maybe 10 years. So Flaubert, Graham Greene, Charlotte Brontë. More recently, Sebastian Barry, Donal Ryan, Cathy Rentzenbrink, Liz Nugent. Anyone I admire I look at their writing and think: “God, how have you done that?”Is there a book you really wish you’d written yourself?The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro. I think it’s a work of genius.Are there any genres you avoid in your own reading?Yes, I don’t read any fantasy. I’ve never even read Lord of the Rings or The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. I only really like things that can happen or did happen. As soon as you introduce a talking horse or Mr Tumnus, I’m just not interested.Who is your favourite literary hero or heroine?Becky Sharp. She’s so terrible in lots of ways but considering where she came from and what she’s trying to do, I admire her pluck and attitude. What book might people be surprised to see on your bookshelves?The autobiography of Andre Agassi. It’s really, really good.Which literary figures – dead or alive – would you most like to meet?I would like to sit at the feet of Toni Morrison and just have her tell me what to do, and I would do it.Who would you like to write the story of your life?Adam Sharp, who is one of the writers in the Common People anthology. He’s a great writer and I love his take on the world. He’s very, very funny but with a big heart.What was the last great book you read?The Water Dancer by Ta-Nehisi Coates. It was beautiful, sad, really well structured and very well researched. And apart from all those things, it’s just a really good read.• Supporting Cast by Kit de Waal is published by Penguin (£8.99).

Chris Power finds out, and shares the all-time greats Marcel Proust’s brother said the problem with In Search of Lost Time was that people “have to be very ill or have a broken leg” in order to read it. Or, he might add today, be confined to their homes in response to a global pandemic. In the early days of the coronavirus lockdown my Twitter feed was full of conversations about whether it was time to read Middlemarch or The Brothers Karamazov, Bleak House or The Anatomy of Melancholy. Whether because of furloughing or just not being able to go to the pub, the general assumption among readers was that there would be a lot of free time to catch up on the big ones that had until now, like Ahab’s white whale, got away.But as time passed I saw these plans fall beneath an avalanche of sourdough starters, 1,000-piece puzzles and Zoom pub quizzes. Even for those who weren’t poleaxed by home schooling and the demands of childcare, something seemed to be making it hard to concentrate on novels – or at least the ones that hadn’t been filmed and considerately deployed to iPlayer, like Sally Rooney’s Normal People.So did the lockdown represent the perfect moment for short stories: those small, sharp bursts of literary flavour? Those Skittles of the book world, as some seem to consider them. I’ve written before against the argument that short stories are ideal for time-pressured readers, or, even worse, short attention s, but I can’t put it better than Lorrie Moore:There’s a lot of yak about how short stories are perfect for the declining public attention . But we know that’s not true. Stories require concentration and seriousness. The busier people get, the less time they have to read a story … people often don’t have a straight half hour of time to read at all. But they have 15 minutes. And that is often how novels are read, 15 minutes at a time. You can’t read stories that way.The time just before lockdown began was weird and chaotic: my wife and I and our daughters fell ill with presumed Covid-19, and it killed my best friend’s mum. But as we recovered and settled into the strange new everyday, I found that short stories really were the reading material that best fit my days. Not because they slip down easily, but because whenever I put a book down, the move from fiction back to reality was so jarring that what I’d just read would be overpowered. The space in my mind where novels persisted when I wasn’t reading them suddenly seemed to be missing, or busy with some other task (comparing national death rates, perhaps). The only things that survived were those I began and finished in one sitting.So whenever I could, between cooking and trying to teach maths, I read a story. I read “The Open Boat”, Stephen Crane’s gripping tale of survival at sea, Joseph Conrad’s haunting account of doubleness, “The Secret Sharer”, and Julio Cortázar’s ingenious Möbius strip of a story, “Continuity of Parks”. They took me far from locked-down London, to Paris, Thailand and the Florida coast, and brought me back again before the next news report or government briefing colonised anything else I was trying to think about.But then, I am a special case: I knew this was going to be a spring and summer of reading short fiction anyway, because I’m one of the judges for this year’s BBC National short story award. In order to test my theory I needed to see if other people shared my experience, ideally people who habitually read a wide range of literature, including short stories. So I got in touch with writers who had won or been shortlisted for the NSSA over the last 14 years – a cohort that represents a recent history of the short story in the UK. Some have struggled to read fiction of any kind. “I’m finding stories a bit too long, and also made up,” Kate Clanchy tells me. “There doesn’t seem any need to make anything up right now. I’m only able to read poetry, essays, and the newspapers.” Lionel Shriver feels the same way. “I have been so rattled by the news,” she says, “that other than the odd short story I have stopped reading fiction. I’m ashamed to say that because at the same time I’m releasing a novel, so I obviously expect other people to read my fiction.”Lucy Caldwell, twice shortlisted and one of my fellow judges this year, tells a similar story of disturbed reading patterns, describing her engagement with books as “idle, frantic, slippery, vague. I’m reading far less than normal and am a much worse reader, which is terrifying: for my whole life, reading has been the place I go to.” This idea of reading as refuge made me wonder about comfort reading, a concept I’ve always found troubling: what about being challenged, upset or disturbed? One of the things I love most about short stories is their ambiguity and irresolution – the opposite of comfort.Sarah Hall helped clarify my thinking when she told me: “I don’t turn to literature for comfort or consolation.” Short stories, she said, “require steady nerves and receptiveness on the part of the reader – a willingness to be affected, troubled and accept opacity”. This chimed with something Claire-Louise Bennett had said to me a few days earlier: “The first short stories I read were folk tales, which, on the one hand, are so vivid and specific, yet intensely mysterious and unyielding too. Those stories were not reassuring and they weren’t meant to be.”But it is also the case that taking comfort or pleasure in a book needn’t mean the literary equivalent of sponge pudding or a hot water bottle. “If a book is well written it doesn’t matter if it’s about something horrific or depressing,” says Jon McGregor. “I just take pleasure in the construction and the writing of it.” Shriver, citing “You Will Never Be Forgotten” by Mary South, a story “about a woman stalking her rapist”, says that, “there’s nothing comforting about that material. What comforts me is good writing. Beyond that, I’m happy to be disturbed.”Tahmima Anam, however, feels quite differently. “I want to be consoled by fiction right now,” she says. “I want it to give me a warm, non-judgmental hug. At the start of lockdown, when I was feeling particularly tender, all I could stomach was a little Jane Austen. I went straight for Persuasion and Sense and Sensibility, and by the time I was finished the world felt a bit less cold.”For Hall, challenge is its own reward. She describes reading a good short story as like “being held between two opposing magnetic forces, which has something to do with both compression of narrative form and the content of the story – that’s the real draw for me, the insecurity and possible reversals I’ll face as a reader.” Once she’s there, she says, “I don’t care how much I’m messed around with psychologically or morally – the more the better, probably. I imagine I’ll always love short stories, even in the apocalypse.”But Anam’s position isn’t about avoiding difficult subject matter. “It’s not that I want to be comforted as in not challenged, but I want to be satisfied. Short stories are shots of espresso – bitter, sharp, and always leaving you slightly unsatisfied. The end of a novel is satisfying the way the end of a short story could never be.” Tessa Hadley, one of the country’s most accomplished short-story writers, also “loves that feeling of immersion in a good novel, a whole world you re-enter each time you pick the book up, as known and alive as your own world is alive.” If fewer readers enjoy short stories, she thinks it’s probably because of “the strenuousness of short story reading”, which demands “more finding your way. More strangeness, perhaps, in the sense that inside a story we’re more puzzled, proportionately, for more of the total of pages, making out what the world of the story is, who its inhabitants are, and what we’re supposed to make of them.” I am struck by how her words could double as a description of the last few months, which we fumbled through as if determining the shape of a new world, and what we made of it.But I didn’t only want to know the outline of what these writers had been reading. I wanted to talk specifics. What has everyone been reading? McGregor has found himself returning to George Saunders, “for the fun he has with voice and register, and how much he loves his characters – even, or especially, the flawed ones”. He has also gone back to Wendy Erskine’s collection Sweet Home, “because I can’t work out how she breathes so much life into her stories”. Cynan Jones, who when I spoke to him hadn’t left his rural property for 70 days, “other than one car dash to check a neighbour’s farm gate was closed”, has felt the need for tales of adventure, “the old-fashioned thing that drew me to stories in the first place. I read Moonfleet by John Meade Falkner last week. Wow! Everyone should read it.” Hadley has been rereading Lucia Berlin’s “superb” short stories, as has Lucy Caldwell: “On a sentence-by-sentence level she’s peerless.” Ingrid Persaud, the 2018 NSSA winner, found strength in Fictions by Jorge Luis Borges, a book she describes as having the ability to “stare down” the current moment of instability and anxiety. Mark Haddon recommended Ted Chiang’s collection Exhalation, and he and Jo Lloyd, winner of last year’s prize, both vouched for the Calvino-like inventions of Kanishk Tharoor’s Swimmer Among the Stars.Lloyd has been avoiding her favourites – Deborah Eisenberg and Edward P Jones – in favour of stories “with a little bit of magic or otherness”, including “Madame Bovary’s Greyhound” by Karen Russell, and “The Lonesome Southern Trials of Knut the Whaler” by Jessie Greengrass. Di Speirs, books editor for BBC Radio and, as a founder of the NSSA and sitting judge, perhaps the best-read short story-lover in the country, recommends William Trevor’s collection The Ballroom of Romance, Alice Munro and Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah’s Friday Black.Hadley and Anam also gave Alice Munro a nod. For Anam she’s “flawless”, while Hadley praised her story “Carried Away”, “because it’s magnificent, and because it’s set in the aftermath of the first world war and the flu epidemic, and yet it’s so clear-eyed, funny, hungry, salty with irony.” For something from the here and now, another former winner of the prize, KJ Orr, told me she’s been kept up at night by the stories in Dima Alzayat’s recent debut collection Alligator.Short stories have been the answer for me during the lockdown, but they might not be for you. Perhaps what you’re looking for isn’t even to be found in the pages of a book. “I don’t go to books for reassurance and solace,” Cynan Jones told me. “I find that around me in the natural world, and sometimes in a Negroni.”• Chris Power is the author of Mothers.

Welty said that “anger lit the fuse” of her story, which seems to seethe on the page.“Fits” by Alice MunroIn 1982 Munro wrote: “Every final draft, every published story, is still only an attempt, an approach, to the story.” “Fits” embodies this belief, as a small town’s inhabitants concoct their own explanations for a murder-suicide that happened in their midst.“Looking for a Rain God” by Bessie HeadHead’s stories, based on interviews she conducted with the villagers of Serowe, Botswana, are like elaborated folktales: the original story, in this case about a terrible drought, is overlaid with a sense of irony, knowledge of history and taste for enigma.“The Company of Wolves” by Angela CarterIn her collection The Bloody Chamber, Carter updated folktales, bringing their “latent content” to the surface to expose their patriarchal assumptions and misogyny. “The Company of Wolves” is her memorable “revisioning” of “Little Red Riding Hood”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11fd76c0a71ff6bffd340401b2cad6d4504dc35f/0_111_4666_2799/master/4666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7db308829992ace7f7b25ddf5fb8d082","title":"face masks public health campaign","story":"With good sense having belatedly prevailed, the policy’s success is dependent on the degree and quality of complianceOn 24 July it becomes compulsory to wear face masks in shops and supermarkets in England. What determines how we can expect such measures to play out? Largely, three things: how confident we can be in the available evidence, the size of the estimated effect among a compliant population, and the degree of compliance.While a lot of attention has focused – rightly – on the first two of these, the third is equally important. Compliance not only encompasses questions of whether there is adherence to the guidance, but also the quality of the adherence. It is instructive, then, to compare the case of face masks with that of another very recent public health intervention: the recommendation of handwashing to stop the spread of Covid-19.Handwashing is simple for most people. It is relatively cheap, and the means required to comply with the request – soap, running water – were largely already available in March, when advice on doing so began. While prior knowledge on handwashing existed, public health campaigns emphasised how best to do so, with simple messaging – “sing Happy Birthday twice” – combined with regular social media and TV campaigns providing more detailed advice.Wearing a face mask is a more complex and costly act, and less familiar. People will face various difficulties in complying. Assuming that any positive effect of making masks mandatory exists, it is vital that these benefits are maximised and any potential downsides mitigated. This raises many additional questions. What sort of masks should be worn? How should they be worn? How often can they be worn? How often do they need to be cleaned? Is it more important to emphasise mask-wearing for certain groups? Might it be sensible to not recommend mask-wearing for others?All this means at least two things: first, we need a public information campaign that helps widespread, effective compliance. This must not say simply “wear a mask”, or bury the answers to these questions on a government website it should make the guidance highly visible and clear to understand. The World Health Organization has produced infographics and films that provide a good template.Second, compliance needs to be possible for everyone. This crisis, and actions taken to mitigate it, has already had a devastating financial impact on many people. The price in a supermarket for a disposable face mask is about 70p: that cost has to be multiplied by the number of daily trips on public transport where masks are already mandatory – and, in one week’s time, will be multiplied by the number of visits to a shop or supermarket. While fabric masks are available, they need to be washed regularly – the WHO says at least once a day – adding more costs. Face masks are already being given away for free at some Network Rail-operated train stations: this could be rolled out more broadly, to other public transport hubs and at supermarkets.The face mask has become something of an unlikely culture-war symbol, whose evidenced benefits are being exaggerated by some of its proponents and whose imposition is feverishly seen as barely a step away from the actions of a totalitarian state by many of its opponents. But concentrating now on whether face masks should be mandatory is to miss the most pressing point.Subject to several exemptions, masks are being made mandatory in shops in England. To continue a proxy war on political or cultural issues – be it Brexit or anything else – into the arena of public health should be unconscionable.This is a debate that, in practical terms, those in favour of masks have won. While there should be subsequent reviews of this policy, a government about-turn ahead of 24 July is extremely unlikely. And so we should demand that they be mandated in a way that means that any health benefits which may arise are maximised and any potential health costs minimised.This makes necessary an extremely visible and easy to understand public health campaign, laying out the merits, rules and requirements of wearing face masks in public. Ideally that would have started a month ago, but that ship has sailed, so at the very least, it needs to start right now. It also means ensuring that the costs of compliance don’t take the greatest toll on people in lower income brackets. Those who have insisted on the introduction of face masks also have a responsibility to demand both of these things.• Daniel Howdon is a senior research fellow at the University of Leeds Institute of Health Sciences"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/067087619ab61f680e3230bcb968b83da0d7b0e3/0_350_5475_3285/master/5475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78cd9bd870119a8c5cae47256294682a","title":"to john lewis with love kevin powell civil rights leader","story":"From the March on Washington to Selma, from the halls of Congress to Black Lives Matter Plaza, you gave yourself to usI gasped when I learned of your death, after your courageous battle against cancer. I think of your December statement, when you said: “I have been in some kind of fight – for freedom, equality, basic human rights – for nearly my entire life. I have never faced a fight quite like the one I have now.”I shed tears then and I shed tears now, at what your passing represents to America and to the world. You do not know this, but the very first time I heard of you, in 1986, I was a Rutgers University student, asked by the Commission for Racial Justice to be part of a group of young people recreating the Freedom Rides you led during the civil rights movement.We stopped in Atlanta, where you were running for Congress. You encouraged us, you gave us an on-the-spot civil rights history, you told us not to be afraid. You seemed to know that some of us, including me, were absolutely terrified.Our bus went on to Alabama, to help African Americans protect their voting rights, just as you had done a generation before. When we heard troubling rumors of white supremacists “coming to get us” for repeating and continuing your work, I held tightly to your words in Atlanta, urging us to never give up – never.That was 34 long years ago. I watched you become a congressman, an elder statesman, the humble and unassuming moral voice of America. I sat on panels with you at the Congressional Black Caucus Annual Legislative Conference. I saw you publicly saddened by attacks on the civil rights for which leaders like you were savagely beaten. That is why you were forever committed to making “Good Trouble” on behalf of democracy.I myself have walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, many times. But my memories there are of you: of the bloodthirsty hatred of the police cracking your skull, how you could have died there on that ground, in your white trench coat, in 1965, just because you believed that Black people, all people, had the right to vote. I vote, Mr Lewis, because of you, because of people like you. I exist because of you, because of people like you.And I have wondered, as you witnessed president after president, one racial murder after another, from your childhood until your death, how you could still possess such a massive capacity to love people, every kind of people, in spite of what you experienced in your 80 years on this planet, in this country. You did not merely preach love, you embodied it, and were clear that love was forever the answer.Is that who you were, Mr Lewis, when you were a boy practicing your sermons to your chickens in your hometown of Troy, Alabama?Is that who you were in 2017, when you led 1,000 people through Comic-Con, a march to celebrate the trilogy of comic books you had written, based on your life?What a life it was, Mr Lewis. To be able to say you spoke at the same majestic March On Washington in 1963, where Dr King gave his “I Have A Dream” address, and to be the last living speaker from that sweltering August day. To be able to say you were there in Indianapolis, Indiana, on the day Bobby Kennedy announced to a mostly Black crowd that Martin Luther King Jr had been killed, Kennedy’s words rivaling King’s as one of the greatest speeches ever. To also say you were there, just two months later in Los Angeles, when Bobby himself was assassinated.To be able to say that your cracked skull and many arrests in the 1960s led to Barack Obama becoming our first Black president, and to also be able to say you lived long enough to witness #MeToo and Black Lives Matter and protests unlike anything we have had since you yourself led nonviolent demonstrations those many years ago.You never stopped protesting, Mr Lewis. In the final months of your life, there you were in Selma, honoring the 55th anniversary of that march. There you were in a virtual town hall meeting with Barack Obama. And there you were, in June, a mere month before your death, admiring the Black Lives Matter mural on the street leading to the White House.You never gave up, Mr Lewis, and neither will I, and neither will we who believe in freedom, justice and equality for everyone. You, sir, were a living, breathing history book of America, a living, breathing example of the best of the human race.The greatest thing you gave us, besides your entire life, was your entire love. The greatest salute to you we can give, is to love ourselves and each other as fiercely as you did us, to the very end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26d84390559b134ad39cf6d3bcc36335afff125f/0_0_4925_3088/master/4925.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4fed6930bb0bcd15cc3a69222d0edbd3 1400w","title":"ian mckellen donates 40000 to help uk theatre workers through pandemic","story":"Charity fund launched for non-performing staff who face poverty and do not qualify for government helpUshers, stage hands, dressers and those who work on the stage door of the nation’s empty theatres are struggling to survive during lockdown, with some even contemplating suicide according to the industry charity, The Theatrical Guild. Now Sir Ian McKellen, the renowned stage and screen star, has helped to launch an emergency fund to support them .The actor, famous for playing Gandalf in Peter Jackson’s Tolkien films, has kicked off the fundraising drive with a donation of £40,000 of the money raised from his recent 80th birthday tour of British theatres.“Many people who work in the theatre industry have seen their livelihoods disappear due to the coronavirus lockdown,” said McKellen. “I, for example, have received a distressing letter from a stage manager who is facing eviction from his home and can’t access government relief.”The actor, who has recently announced a plan to play Hamlet again, 50 years after the last time, and who is now attending virtual rehearsals for the role, added that the emergency fund scheme is “a wonderful opportunity”. The guild was set up 125 years ago to support those who, with their varied sets of skills, are the unsung heroes of staged performances. Most are low-paid, self-employed or on zero hours contracts and as a result many have fallen through the safety nets put up by the government to protect those who lost work during the pandemic.Actors Eddie Redmayne and Prasanna Puwanarajah are also backing the new fundraising effort because of the evidence of serious need in the front-of-house and backstage community, which includes costumiers, wig makers, props assistants, scene painters, lighting and sound operators, box office and bar staff as well as cleaners.The privations of lockdown have meant many have been unable to pay their rent and several have considered suicide, Adam Bambrough, the guild’s general manager told The Observer.“These people are a huge part of every single theatrical building in the country and they are the public face of many theatres. As well being mainly freelancers, those with jobs have been hit heavily by the swathe of redundancies happening in theatres,” said Bambrough. “Sadly I have heard from nine or 10 people who have been contemplating taking their own lives in the last few weeks. Many others are struggling to find the money for food and rent.”The emergency appeal is aimed at helping with food bills, housing costs, mental health services and other basic essentials. The guild cites the example of one stage manager, Maria, who lost her room in theatre digs overnight when her production shutdown. The guild has given her money for temporary accommodation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/884c16c3490b5b97485a30323814eb4a6313d950/0_160_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9394a121f22805365eb4ba012e1407da","title":"share your photos from the big butterfly count 2020","story":"As the world’s biggest butterfly count gets underway once again, we’d like to see photos of what you’ve seenToday sees the start of the UK’s annual Big Butterfly Count, organised by Butterfly Conservation, which asks people to spend 15 minutes in an outdoor space and count the amount and type of butterflies, and some day-flying moths, they see.We’d like to hear about the butterflies that you spot too – and we’d also like to see photographs, if you’re lucky enough to capture them.

An independent scientist who eschews the academic establishment, he has variously been described as a maverick, prophet of doom, environmental philosopher and Gandalf. This month, he turns 101, but shows little sign of slowing his intellectual output. A paperback version of his latest book, Novacene, will shortly be released and he is working on a follow-up. Is the virus part of the self-regulation of Gaia?Definitely, it’s a matter of sources and sinks. The source is the multiplication of the virus and the sink is anything we can do to get rid of it, which is not at the moment very effective. This is all part of evolution as Darwin saw it. You are not going to get a new species flourishing unless it has a food supply. In a sense that is what we are becoming. We are the food. I could easily make you a model and demonstrate that as the human population on the planet grew larger and larger, the probability of a virus evolving that would cut back the population is quite marked. We’re not exactly a desirable animal to let loose in unlimited numbers on the planet. Malthus was about right. In his day, when the human population was much smaller and distributed less densely across the planet, I don’t think Covid would have had a chance.How will lockdown affect this prognosis?After this virus, I suspect quite a hefty change will be discernible. I think people will discover all sorts of things they can do that they didn’t do before. Maybe they’ll realise it is not such a good idea to get fat that much of the suffering they get in middle age and later life is caused by just eating too much of the wrong sort of food. I always find it fascinating how the statistics illustrate that the health of the nation was enormously better at the end of the second world war than it was at the beginning.Early in your career, you did some research in this field…The first work I did after university was with the Medical Research Council in the department run by the discoverer of the influenza virus, Sir Christopher Andrewes. My job was to measure the number of droplets caused by coughing and sneezing in underground shelters during the second world war. There had been a deadly influenza virus at the end of the first world war and they were mortally afraid of that starting again because the tube was crammed with people.I read that it was at the Medical Research Council that you invented the electron capture detector…Yes, we developed a method of freezing hamsters so they were lumps of ice that you could bang on the table. Then we would bring them back to life in one of the first microwave ovens that existed. It turned out the reasons the hamsters could survive and other animals could not was that their fat had freezing points well below that of water. I asked my colleague Archer Martin, who invented gas chromatography, if he could analyse these things for me. When he saw the size of the sample, he said: “Only if you could invent a more sensitive detector for me.” I went away and in two weeks, I came back with two detectors, one of which was the first commercial one used with gas chromatography around the world and brought in quite a bit of money for the HMRC. The other one was the electron capture detector which later revealed the presence of ozone-depleting gases in the stratosphere and pollutants like PCB in the air, soil and water.It was because of this that I was probably the first person in Britain to be asked by Nasa to help them with the moon and Mars landings. My device weighed only a few grammes and was more sensitive than anything else and used almost no power at all. They thought: “Great, this is what we need. Come over to the States.” So I did.The French philosopher Bruno Latour recently told me your invention of the electron capture detector revealed truths about life on this planet in the same way that Galileo’s telescope revealed truths about the universe. Did you realise how important the device would become?I had no idea at the time. Latour is completely right, but I didn’t see it in that way at first because Galileo’s discovery is much more direct. If you see the moon and the planets orbiting the sun in such and such a way with your telescope, you can come to conclusions about the whole system. With the Earth, if i went to my cottage in Ireland and measured the emissions coming from Laminaria saccharina – a straplike seaweed that releases iodide compounds – I couldn’t jump immediately from that to a theory of how the Earth regulates itself. That is many steps further on. It is just a bit of evidence about the chains of life. As those bits of evidence gradually build up, you get a story like Gaia forming.Latour believes the establishment struggles to accept your ideas because they are such a conceptual leap. He believes the shift from Galileo to Gaia is as big as that from Aristotle to Galileo. But very different, of course. While Galileo opened exploration into an infinite universe, you revealed we are in a closed, very precarious system that we need to stabilise. Do you think people are willing to acknowledge this?I would love to be able to speak to Galileo to understand how he felt. We were both loners who met a lot of opposition. I think Galileo’s problem was largely with the church rather than people at large. It was so contrary to their dogma that they hated it. I have felt for some time that the universities are getting dangerously like the early church. They have dozens of different sects and they are quite proud if you belong to one of them: if you are a chemist you often don’t know anything about biology and so on. This is why ordinary university science is not really helpful because the department looking at seaweed would not be the same as the one looking at methyl iodide. It is a ision into bits. It’s time universities were revolutionised and had much more common thinking. It’s amazing how much objection there is to Gaia. I’m wondering to what extent you can put that down to the coal and oil industries who fought against any kind of message that would be bad for them.If Gaia theory were better understood, could it be the basis for a creed that fills in the gaps that religion used to fill in terms of living well, living for others, living for future generations?I think in a way you are right. Nobody fully comprehends Gaia and that includes me, but it’s an easier thing to understand than God and religion. You just have to take those for granted. But with Gaia you can go out in the world and start measuring things.Are you at all religious?No, I was brought up a Quaker. I was indoctrinated with the notion that God is a still, small voice within rather than some mysterious old gentleman way out in the universe. Intuition comes from that voice within and is a great gift for inventors.Do you believe humanity can invent something to stabilise the climate?Well, we better had or we are doomed, but we are doing the opposite by burning fossil fuels. I always advocated nuclear as a good and cheap and sensible way of getting energy especially now that thorium is available as a fuel. But too many people hate it. I like Edward Teller’s suggestion of a sunshade in a heliocentric orbit that would diffuse a few percent of sunlight from the Earth. You would hardly notice it was there. If it could be done, and I think a big Nasa programme could almost certainly do it, it could save our bacon. It seems a more outrageous and difficult proposition than other geoengineering projects like putting sulphur into the stratosphere, but I prefer it. You could make it so that if anything went wrong it would automatically collapse. But overall, I don’t think we should start messing about with the Gaia system until we know a hell of a lot more about it. It is beginning to look as if renewable energy – wind and solar – if properly used, may be the answer to the energy problems of humanity. You turn 101 years old on 26 July. How will you mark your birthday?It won’t be anything like the party last year or we would be broke. But we will celebrate. If the weather is good, we will go for a walk. My wife Sandy and I go out for a two- to three-mile walk most days, along the coast or up the hills. I’ve been one of the lucky ones who enjoyed lockdown because there are fewer people and no parked cars. And I may work on my next book, which I am deep into now. It is about evolution, particularly evolution of humans. Humans are evolving rapidly. We have changed from a tribal animal into a city animal. Look at most insects and they have trod that path already. There is plenty to write about.Novacene by James Lovelock will be published in paperback by Penguin on 30 July (£9.99)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/349515a99417f2ce31051ce1cabf647016470562/128_0_4926_2956/master/4926.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e107bd2b7e6480d200e4b25d61f2fa37","title":"we cant blame animals human pathogens are making their way into vulnerable wildlife","story":"Australian scientists have found evidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in about a dozen species, including bats, penguins, sea lions and wallabiesby  Graham Readfearn Photography by Doug GimesyFor 13 years now, scientist Michelle Power has been grabbing samples of human waste and animal poop from Antarctica to Australia to try and answer a vital question.Has the bacteria in humans that has grown resistant to antibiotics – an issue considered to be one of the world’s greatest health challenges – made its way into wildlife?The answer, it seems, is a resounding yes.“I don’t think there’s been an animal where we haven’t found it,” says Power, an associate professor at Macquarie University in Sydney.The sorts of animals Power has chosen to look at most live close to humans or are urbanised – like possums – or animals that spend time with humans either in wildlife care facilities or in conservation breeding programs.So far, Power says she has found evidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in about a dozen animals, including bats, penguins, sea lions and wallabies.“You have organisms moving from us, to animals, and then potentially back to us again,” she says. “At the moment it’s hard to track what’s coming back and forth, but we know humans have driven this emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.”Power’s work on the issue started in 2007 when she looked at faeces samples of endangered brush-tailed rock wallabies being raised in captivity in New South Wales as part of conservation efforts.About half the wallabies had antibiotic-resistant bacteria in their faeces. Those animals were released back into the wild.In late 2009, Power fulfilled a romantic 20-year-old dream of travelling to Antarctica to do scientific research. The rather less romantic goal was to sample the human sewage from a research station there, and to “sneak up behind penguins and seals” and take their poo.But again, her findings revealed that bacteria from humans was making its way into the Antarctic wilderness, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria.Between 2017 and 2019, Power’s scientific colleagues together with wildlife carers have collected 448 poo samples from the little penguins of Philip Island and St Kilda, and from the penguins in zoos (one method to collect samples from wild penguins is to leave a piece of card near the entry to a nesting box because, Power says, they “like to poo out the door”).Power has also been part of an ongoing citizen science project encouraging others to do the faeces collecting – this time, asking for the secretions of possums.In 2019, Power was part of a study that found antibiotic resistance in grey-headed flying foxes – a species listed as vulnerable.In research yet to be published, Power says she has found evidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in wild populations of Tasmanian devils.So how did our bacteria get into the animals?Power says about three-quarters of the antibiotics that humans take are actually excreted, ending up in wastewater systems. Places where antibiotics are manufactured are also potential avenues for escape of antibiotics.And then there are the times when animals are taken into care, or raised in captivity and exposed to humans, and then released into the wild.Possums are a species that are highly urbanised, sometimes feed on the ground, and live and eat close to humans – close enough that many find homes in the roof space of Australian houses. But they tend to be solitary.Power says: “Maybe the possums are getting closer to our organisms, but also they’re solitary species. Flying foxes on the other hand live up in trees but live in higher densities.”According to the World Health Organisation, the emergence of bacteria resistant to antibiotics is one of the world’s greatest health challenges facing humans, making treatment of dangerous diseases ever more challenging.But the impact of this bacteria on wildlife, Power says, “is the big unknown” and she says there’s no direct evidence yet that it’s doing harm.She says: “The gene transfer of endemic bacteria could alter microbial communities and know more and more each day about the significance of friendly microbes to healthy immunity.”Dr Wayne Boardman is a wildlife veterinarian at the University of Adelaide and the former head vet at London Zoo who has been collaborating with Power on research.One big concern Boardman holds is that the antibiotic resistance could make it harder for vets to care for sick animals.But also, he says, the bacteria and the genes associated with them that are being passed from humans to animals could then evolve and come back into the human population.“It’s in the bacteria’s interest to try and protect themselves,” he says. “Whilst the risks are relatively small, they could be compounded over the years because we have more of these antimicrobial resistant genes occurring and then we get further and further into the mire.“It’s a human induced issue. We can’t blame the animals. It’s only humans using antibiotics.”Prof Clare McArthur, a behavioural ecologist at the University of Sydney, says Power has answered the first important question – are human bacteria being passed into our wildlife?“The next questions is, does it matter,” she says. “I think of this from a gut perspective. We know that the gut biome is important and we know from humans that if you tweak it then things can go pear shaped in terms of our health.“In the back of my mind is the question – if they’re picking up antibiotic-resistant bacteria, is that altering their gut biome? We don’t have an answer for that yet.”As for Power, she’s worried that wildlife picking up human pathogens could be another pressure on species already vulnerable.“These bacteria are pathogens and they can cause diseases in us. I’m worried about wildlife health and what some of these resistant bacteria might mean for wildlife species, many of which are already vulnerable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b4c23f6ecc68598126b0b77ca7c68bb8721792d/55_167_1945_1167/master/1945.jpg?width=1140\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5388946a5d73a21c375df930f3312f84 2280w","title":"andi oliver when people are in trauma they need the love of food","story":"The chef and broadcaster on the horrors of rural Suffolk in the 1970s, cooking with her best friend Neneh Cherry and the only way to eat oystersI remember standing on the stool next to Mum and making white sauce for a cauliflower cheese for the Sunday meal when I was five or six. Around that time we moved from England to Cyprus and it was sunny and lovely there. School finished at midday in the summer and I made friends easily and it was an easy transition for me. It was much more of an eating-out culture than it had been in England and I remember an octopus being pulled out of the sea, killed on the rocks and me eating it, all charred, barbecued and with that lemony deliciousness. “Wow, that’s what they do,” I thought. It was a moment of ignition in my consciousness – being transfixed by the flow of life and death and poetry and beauty.It’s said that my grandmother on my mother’s side used to dance naked on a beach. She had 12 children. And she instilled a fire in all their bellies and in mine – a determination to push through any problem and to meet your goal.When I was told “We’re going home,” I thought: “What do you mean? This is home.” But home became an air base in Suffolk. It was grey, cold, miserable, the 1970s and a very racist environment – that’s just a fact – I hated every minute. We went for doner kebab and it was just awful, bastardised, so different. It was like being dumped in some level of Hades. Luckily, I made two friends – Sue and Louise, who are still very good friends nowadays – because otherwise I don’t know how I would have got through it.I was the only black girl for miles. People whispered strange things behind my back and called me terrible names. My boobs grew big early and I was sexualised and didn’t understand what was going on. Just for instance, I babysat for a neighbour who tried to put his tongue down my throat. Sometimes I wonder why I didn’t tell my mother about my pain. I went through a lot, but I survived and it helped make me who I am nowadays and I like the way I am.Dad was a flamboyant cook. He’d come down to Brixton market or Ridley Road market in London and do massive food shops buying half a sheep and getting it cut down. He would buy sacks of black-eye peas, still slightly wet, and I’d de-pod them. I hated it then, but now I think it’s quite groovy. He’d make some lovely meals then we would spend the rest of the day cleaning up the mess.Dad was a real bon vivant, a great host. One of my earliest and most comforting memories was going to sleep with the sound of happy people having a party in the next room, of them cracking up and the ice-cubes going in the glasses.I’d left home by 17, come to London and met Neneh Cherry. We became best friends and started cooking a lot. We’d hold huge parties – once we bought 100 mackerel and boned, filleted, cured and roasted them for 100 people. What a funny pair of teenagers we were. I think we were trying to create home, to root everybody, to create security and continuity, somewhere where people could be good, safe and kind.My brother loved a Fray Bentos pie and once put one on the cooker when he was drunk and woke up with it all over the ceiling.Top of my list of restaurants to go to, when possible, is the Grey in downtown Savannah in Georgia, run by the amazing Mashama Bailey. She’s taken American soul food and elevated it with an elegant, beautiful delivery which echoes old ways of doing things. I really like tradition and innovation hand-in-hand.I dream about recipes and cooking. Or that I’m in a mad service at a restaurant and things are broken. When my partner and I were running a pub, seven days a week for two and a half years, I had nightmares about getting food wrong. But then I’d wake up and realise: “I’m fine. No one’s waiting to be served.”FoodWarming soul food. That’s not necessarily black food or food from any African diaspora but, for instance, great steak and kidney pudding, Cuban mojo, south American barbacoa, slow-cooked goat curry, Thai duck noodle … old-school home and hearth recipes which tend to embody a style, lifestyle or culture.Drink At the moment, strong delicious frozen pina colada, like an ice-cream, but not. At a Caribbean pop-up in a friend’s pub garden in Clacton I recently realised I was having three of them a day while working, so I had to put myself on a ration.Place to eatI’ve got quite a few. But if there’s one place over the years, it’s probably aunt Gwen’s house in Guyana. She’s Antiguan-Guyanese and the Guyanese are the best cooks in the Caribbean. She’s very ill at the moment, but I daydream about her rotis. There’s a phrase in Guyana, when someone really likes your cooking – “Your hand is sweet”. Her hand is very sweet.Signature dish There’s a honey-baked chicken dish I’ve done for 45 years at least. Our kids crave it, whether happy or sad.

It may be a whole fish, its belly stuffed with spinach and young courgettes a leg of lamb cooked with thyme and lemon or a platter of roast peppers with lentils, a dressing of its roasting juices and cream. On the side will be my beloved roast potatoes (it’s not a roast without potatoes), but served with a bright dressing of yogurt and crisp summer roots. And while the oven is on, I might bake some apricots or peaches for an intense summer ice-cream.I may not have been to Greece for decades, but the smell of lamb roasting on a summer’s day is invariably laden with memories of whitewashed houses with blue doors, narrow stone-floored alleyways and searing crimson geraniums. If I am going to eat red meat in high summer it will almost certainly be lamb, marinated with thyme, rosemary and occasionally garlic, and roasted on the bone. To make carving almost effortless, I recently asked the butcher to remove the bone, but to include it in the parcel, so I could tuck it under the trimmed meat, opened flat, like a book, as it roasted.Serves 4-6thyme sprigs 10grosemary 20gparsley 75gfennel fronds or dill 20golive oil 200mllemon 1 smalllamb 1 leg, boned but not rolled, 2 kgbay leaves 4Remove the leaves from the thyme, rosemary, parsley and fennel and put them in a food processor or blender. Keep the stems for the stockpot. Pour in the olive oil and blend to a thick paste. Squeeze the lemon, then stir the juice and a little salt and ground black pepper into the herb paste.Open the boned lamb flat and place, skin side down, on a chopping board. Score deeply with a very sharp knife, turn over and repeat on the other side. Put the lamb in a large bowl or zip-lock bag and pour in the marinade, rubbing it into the meat as you go. Add the bay leaves and set aside for an hour or more. Overnight in the fridge wouldn’t hurt.Set the oven at 200C fangas mark 7. Remove the lamb from the marinade and place it, fat side uppermost in a roasting tin, then spread the marinade over it. Roast for 20 minutes then lower heat to 140C fangas mark 3 and continue roasting for a further 20 minutes.Remove the lamb from the oven and place a tent of foil over the tin. Leave it to rest for 15-20 minutes before scattering with a little sea salt and carving thickly. Spoon any roasting juices over as you serve.There is often an oval plate of thinly sliced beef or cold pork on the table at this time of year. Cold cuts as they used to be called, and something I am more than happy to eat if there is a pot of good, glossy mayonnaise on the side. But they will be welcomed more if they appear with a dish of roast potatoes. This mildly spiced recipe comes with a yogurt raita, crunchy with grated beetroot and tomatoes, and speckled with coriander, its appearance at the table suddenly makes a platter of cold meat (or smoked mackerel or chicken) really sing.Serves 4maris piper 1kg, or similar potatoesonions 3, mediumgroundnut oil 6 tbspcoriander seeds 1 tspcumin seeds 1 tspground turmeric 1 tspFor the raitaraw beetroot 150g, peeledtomatoes 2 mediumgarlic 2 clovesginger 25g piecenigella seeds 1 tspnatural yogurt 200mliced water 100mlcoriander leaves 4 tbsp, choppedWhile you cut the potatoes into large pieces, bring a large pot of water to the boil and salt it generously. Cook the potatoes in the boiling water for 10 minutes, then drain.Set the oven at 180C fangas mark 6. Peel the onions and cut them into quarters from root to tip. Warm the oil in a roasting tin, add the onions and the drained potatoes, turning them over in the oil as you go. Roast for 50 minutes or until the potatoes are golden and the onions soft.Crush the coriander and cumin seeds to a coarse powder, then mix with the ground turmeric. Add the spice mix to the potatoes and onions, and toss gently to coat. Return them to the oven for a further 10 minutes.Make the raita: coarsely grate the peeled beetroot into a bowl. Finely dice the tomatoes and add them. Peel and finely crush the garlic and grate the ginger to a puree, then stir into the beetroot. Mix the nigella seeds together with the yogurt and the iced water, whisking them until smooth, then stir in the vegetables and the coriander leaves. Serve, chilled, with the hot roast potatoes and onions.A whole fish, plump with a stuffing of summer vegetables, is a splendid dish to bring to the table. I like using spinach, grated courgette or fennel, or perhaps young carrots to fill the fish with (avoid beetroot, it sends the fish pink). Some new potatoes, sliced and baked around the fish is a thoroughly good thing, as would be a bottle of olive oil to pass around, to trickle over the fish and its stuffing once it’s on your plate. You do need the potatoes, though. No matter how your large your sea bass is, it will still only be enough for two or three of you.Serves 2-3jersey royals 400g, or other new potatoesolive oil 5 tbspcourgettes 150gspinach leaves 400gdried chilli flakes 1 tspsea bass 1 whole, about 1kgSet the oven at 180C fangas mark 6. Scrub the potatoes, then cut them into rounds about as thick as one-pound coins. Toss them in half of the oil, seasoned with salt and black pepper, then place them on a shallow roasting tin, leaving an empty space in the middle in which to place the fish. Bake the potatoes for about 10 minutes.Coarsely grate the courgette into a colander. Wash the spinach leaves but don’t shake them dry. Put them into a large pan, cover tightly, then place over a moderate heat for 2 or 3 minutes. Keep an eye on them, turning the leaves once they are starting to wilt. When they have softened in texture and brightened in colour, remove from the heat.Put the spinach in a colander and run a little cold water through the leaves, then squeeze firmly to remove the water. Roughly chop the spinach. Wring the grated courgette in your hand to remove any moisture, then add to the chopped spinach and season with salt and the dried chilli flakes.Remove the tray from the oven. Place the fish in the middle of the tin and fill the belly with the spinach and courgette stuffing, pushing it right into the cavity, then pour over the remaining olive oil and season lightly with salt and black pepper.Bake the fish for 30 minutes, till the skin is starting to crisp and the potatoes are golden. Should they colour too quickly, then cover them with a little kitchen foil. Remove from the oven and lift on to a serving dish, or fillet on the roasting tin if you prefer.I roast peppers as much for the caramel-sweet juices that congregate in the roasting tin as I do for their silken scarlet flesh. Those juices are dressing enough for the peppers, but they can also act as the backbone of something a little more involved, such as a dressing into which you tear leaves of basil or cooked lentils. A splash of cream might seem unnecessary, but it is quite wonderful with the sherry-coloured roasting juices. And I should add that it really is worth cooking the peppers until the skins have browned here and there.Set the oven at 180C fangas mark 6.Slice the peppers in half, discard the seeds and cores, then cut each half into three. Put them in a baking tray and trickle the olive oil over them. Bake for about 35 minutes, until the peppers are soft and the skins are brown in patches.Cook the lentils with the bay leaves, in deep, unsalted boiling water for about 30 minutes, then drain them in a colander.Remove the peppers from the oven, then place the pan over a low to moderate heat. Stir in the drained lentils, the cream and the basil leaves, then season generously with salt and black pepper.Lift the peppers onto a serving plate, then spoon the lentils and the creamy juices around them.Sometimes, on a hot summer’s afternoon, I will simmer apricots with a little honey and water till the fruit has softened and the honey has turned to a light syrup. I add a few drops of rosewater, then chill them till the syrup is almost ice cold, and eat them the next day for breakfast. This heady mixture, with its faintly Middle Eastern notes, also makes an excellent ice-cream, delicate and beautiful. An ice-cream the colour of sunset at midsummer.I like the soft consistency of an ice-cream made in a commercial machine, but it is easy enough to make without one. Transfer the fruit and custard mixture to a freezer box, cover tightly, and freeze for an hour or two, until ice crystals have formed around the edge. Remove briefly from the freezer, whisk the crystals into the liquid centre, cover and return to the freezer. Leave for a further hour, then repeat the whisking. This will ensure a softer, creamier texture. Continue until almost frozen.Enough for 4apricots 500ghoney 4 tbspFor the custarddouble cream 400mlegg yolks 4caster sugar 90grosewater 1 tspSet the oven at 180C fangas mark 6. Halve the apricots, discarding the stones, and place the fruit in a roasting tin. Trickle the honey over the apricots then bake for about 25 minutes until the honey and juices are bubbling and the fruit is meltingly soft and fragrant. Remove the tin from the oven and roughly crush the fruit with a fork. Spoon into a bowl and set aside to cool.Warm the cream in a small pan, bringing it almost to the boil. Beat the egg yolks and sugar till thick (I use an electric whisk but a wooden spoon could suffice), then pour the warm cream over, stirring thoroughly. Rinse and dry the milk pan, return the custard to the pan and place over a low to moderate heat.Stir the custard with a wooden spoon, almost constantly, until it thickens to the consistency of double cream. Stir in the rosewater. Remove from the heat immediately and cool quickly. (I like to pour the custard into a clean bowl set over a second bowl of ice and stir till the steam no longer rises.) When the custard is cold, stir into the apricot and honey mixture, taste and add a little more rosewater if you wish, then pour into an ice-cream maker and churn till softly frozen.

This was a frustrating night in north London for Pep Guardiola. Not only did City lose an FA Cup tie for the first time since February 2018, they lost in a way Guardiola teams sometimes do, choking on their own increasingly sluggish possession and passing themselves to death against opponents ready to sit deep.For Arsenal this might just feel like confirmation of something. For the second time in four days Mikel Arteta’s team produced a performance of real defensive discipline against one of the Premier League’s reigning powers, not just absorbing pressure but breaking with great incision. Granit Xhaka was a calm, efficient presence in midfield. Nicolas Pépé used his speed advisedly, stretching City on the right flank, where Ainsley Maitland-Niles fought tigerishly and used the ball well. There are signs here of something starting to stir.At kick-off Wembley had been a mournful kind of place, the excitable tones of the stadium PA bouncing around the vast swooping stands. This is a gloomy concrete sepulchre at the best of times and these are not, by any measure, the best of times. For FA Cup semi-final day the wide grey concourses were a ghost town, sweet trolleys and hotdog stands shuttered, a reminder of the havoc the current crisis has wreaked on FA finances.Guardiola picked a starting XI crammed with ball players, with lIkay Gündogan the only real defensive presence in the front six. It was a team that seemed geared towards something similar to the Liverpool game at the Emirates in midweek, where David Luiz – yes, that David Luiz – had led the most stirring deep defensive performance of this late section of the season.Here Arteta began with a back five as City produced an early swarm of possession, forcing the red shirts back towards their own goal, and almost into it at times. But it was Arsenal who had the first clear chance with 15 minutes gone.David Luiz pulled a poor Aymeric Laporte clearance out of the air and played a simple straight pass through the centre of City’s midfield to Aubameyang, unmarked in front of goal. He shot powerfully, but straight at Ederson. It felt like an ominous miss – but not to Aubameyang, who opened the scoring four minutes later at the end of another move that met zero resistance from the sky blue shirts. Héctor Bellerín fed Pépé on the right. His deep cross curved across the City defence unimpeded and was met by a wonderful angled close-range finish from the skipper.Arsenal continued to alternate deep defence with moments of counterattack. City still had the most of the ball, but there were hasty clearances, too, and some muddled passing. Shkodran Mustafi drew a flying save from Ederson, heading a corner back towards goal. And City still hadn’t managed a shot on target as the half-time whistle blew.They were back out early after the break, beginning with a familiar urgency. For a while it was more of the same, just to an even greater degree: more sky blue passing patterns, more deep red-shirted defence. David Silva sparked one little interchange that saw Raheem Sterling shoot wide with a clear sight of goal. It took Arsenal eight minutes to construct a move in the opposition half.He still almost provided the equaliser, dipping a free-kick over the wall and into the side-netting. Moments later Sterling fell under a challenge from Mustafi in the area but Arsenal survived the VAR check. Sterling then produced a horrible miss in front of goal. Surprised by the flight of a corner from the left, he could only deflect the ball weakly off his nose when any kind of header looked a certain goal.It was Arsenal who emerged from behind their guard to score the second, killer goal on 71 minutes. The goal was made by a wonderful diagonal ball by Kieran Tierney, who curled an instant pass behind City’s high defensive line from the left side. Once again the finish was high craft. Aubameyang eased clear of Eric García, shifted his hips to change the angle, and slipped the ball through Ederson’s legs to make it 2-0.City still pressed. Laporte crashed a shot on to the outside of a post. It never really looked like being enough. The final, two weeks from now, will provide a gloss on a strange and traumatic season.The last week has also offered something else, a sense of the strings being tightened and of a make-do-and-mend team responding, for the first time in some time, to a new set of rhythms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7df6c6a0f4b8cdb488a500a55d05b6897e51aac5/0_62_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24fff6487a4d99f3ed39f84d96a977cc","title":"shared screen time can help five unexpected ways to really connect with your kids","story":"From toddlers to teens, here’s how to keep the lockdown closeness thrivingAnnabel Rosenhead, a psychotherapist who’s co-authored Happy Confident Me with parenting coach Nadim Saad, reveals five simple but effective ways to keep connecting:1. Talk franklyFrom teachers wearing masks at school to cancelled holidays, coming out of lockdown can mean tricky conversations and how you approach these topics can make all the difference. Rosenhead explains: “Our children – whatever age they are – are our mirrors. So, before you talk to them, check in with yourself. ‘Am I stressed? Overwhelmed? Anxious?’ and address what you need, even if it’s just five minutes in a room by yourself. Because it’s not what you’re saying but how you’re saying it that’s important.“Then, think about what you’re going to tell your children (don’t just blunder in) and get on the same level as them – difficult conversations are often best had when you’re doing something together, such as going for a walk or playing snap. With a four-year-old, it could be colouring in, while for teenagers it may be gaming together or cooking.”3. Let them take over“The way children have been really affected by the pandemic – from younger ones right the way through to young adults – is a lack of agency. As a child, you don’t have much control anyway but now that’s shrunk right down,” says Rosenhead. “Any sense of independence at school is no longer happening, which can also affect their self-esteem and mental wellbeing. So you need to counter this with connection, communication and giving them their agency back.“For example, I’ve been going on daily bike rides with my 10-year-old daughter and I now let her cycle on the road, which I never would have done before lockdown. I let her choose the route, even when she’s got me riding all over the place it’s giving them the opportunities to decide things.” So from navigating with your map app to picking items for online shopping or Googling holiday destinations for the future, let your kids take over some big decisions.5. Do something brand newSearching out recipes for sourdough starters, asking Alexa how to plant tomatoes, downloading Couch to 5K … hobbies have come into their own in lockdown. “Shared experiences are enormously bonding and learning together is a great leveller,” recommends Rosenhead. “Children and teenagers are so used to being told what to do but if you’re both out and about learning something new, you’re doing it as equals. These things give a sense of togetherness and will build memories.” So, yes, studying “How to pogo” videos in the park creates an important parent-child connection. “Hopefully, this time together will be one of the good things our children will take with them into the future,” says Rosenhead.From helping your kids stay connected with their friends to sharing time together as they acquaint you with the intricacies of TikTok, getting the most from your mobile data has never been more important.Keep connecting with our unlimited data plans.

Then, coronavirus arrived and working from home became vital to keeping many businesses afloat.So, how can you convince your employer to make flexible working the new normal? Here’s the evidence you need …Working from home worksA global pandemic is nobody’s idea of a perfect backdrop for a major change in working practices, but in spite of the obstacles, millions of office workers have transformed into home workers and our jobs are still getting done. Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey has even told his 5,000 employees they can choose to work at home forever. “We want employees to be able to work where they feel most creative and productive,” explained a spokesperson. Bhutta isn’t surprised. “OK, we didn’t choose this situation,” she says. “But flexibility is clearly available in many more jobs than had been advertised on that basis. We need employers to ask themselves, has there really been a significant drop in productivity? I think they’ll find employees have been doing their best in very challenging circumstances.”People are working smarterA huge amount of time during the office working day is wasted on interruptions and unnecessary meetings. “We all know the stress of presenteeism, of having to sit in a meeting room for an hour while someone drones on – it drains activity,” says Tracey Follows, founder of the strategy consultancy Futuremade. “Working from home allows you to take control of how and when you use your energy,” she says. This in turn can lead to increased efficiency.It makes employees happy You want to jump on a video call from the park? Download documents at the beach? Thanks to Vodafone’s unlimited data, you can. Helping employees to achieve a better work-life balance is an obvious way to support them and encourage their loyalty. “Flexible working means the employer gets an engaged, happy employee who is able to concentrate on their job while they’re working because they can also plan for the school pick-up or to visit elderly relatives,” says Bhutta. “When people have autonomy they are loyal and committed, which leads to benefits in terms of productivity.”The traditional office is outdatedOne look at the deserted skyscrapers in our cities shows that it’s time to retire any romantic attachment to Mad Men-style central offices. Especially now that screen partitions between desks, regular deep cleaning and one-way traffic systems will need to be implemented to help prevent future waves of coronavirus. Offices could well transform into occasional spaces where people meet for training days or to collaborate on projects. Even the CEO of Barclays Bank, Jes Staley, has acknowledged that “the notion of putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past”. While, sadly, this might signal the end of the office biscuit tin, it could save employers hundreds of millions pounds in annual office costs.Businesses can access more talentSaying goodbye to the traditional office means an opportunity to welcome in new staff, talent and ideas from all over the world. “Flexibility opens up the workforce to many more people,” says Follows. “It gives opportunities for talented people who live far from big cities, who are from different socioeconomic backgrounds or have disabilities. It’s an opportunity to be grasped.”Employers get to be human tooDuring this crisis, thanks to all the video meetings, we’ve got to know our colleagues and bosses as actual people who have overloaded bookshelves, home schooled kids and cute puppies in their lives. Employers have become relatable, not just an intimidating presence at board meetings. “Seeing people’s kids and dogs popping up on video calls has meant that people’s responsibilities have become visible in the world of work, in a way that they weren’t before,” says Bhutta. “It’s been a real opportunity to see people beyond their role at work. And that’s something we don’t want to turn the clock back on.”From uninterrupted video meetings to deciding when and where you work best, getting the most from your mobile data has never been more important.Keep connecting with our unlimited data plans.

And it’s a trend that’s set to continueIt doesn’t take a statistician to work out that we’ve all been online a lot in the last few months. From home schooling and streaming to ensuring your household has all the essentials (which may or may not have been purchased from Deliveroo), the number of gigabytes we’ve used and the time we’ve spent online has ticked ever upwards.But exactly how much more are we online now? What’s using up most of our data? And what will happen as lockdown ends? Turns out it does take statisticians to work all that out – which is why we’ve looked at their reports to compile this list of five facts about you, the internet and your data usage. You’re welcome.1. In lockdown, we’ve each been online for four hours and two minutes a dayYou always knew you had it in you to be a record breaker, didn’t you? You were right. According to Ofcom’s new Online Nation 2020 report, an annual survey looking at how the UK’s internet usage is changing, the four hours and two minutes we’ve averaged online during lockdown is a new high. And it’s an increase of 37 minutes a day per online adult compared with January 2020.Even without lockdown, we’ve been using the internet more than ever before. In the past year before we were locked down, we were online for 17 minutes a day more than the previous year. The biggest users? 18 to 24 year olds, who logged on for an hour more each day than adults overall.“That’s one of the more interesting stats that we found,” says Jory MacKay, RescueTime’s marketing manager. “This means that essentially each time you look at your phone you’ve got a 5050 chance of setting off a chain reaction of phone check ins.”5. Why unlimited data deals are great for familiesYou know that feeling when your work Zoom call’s audio goes so robotic and stuttery it’s like a Daft Punk remix? And on investigation, it turns out that the rest of your household is variously streaming video, online gaming and generally draining so much of your bandwidth that they might as well have attached a tap and be dispensing pints of it in the street?“As households are doing their learning, communicating, streaming – everything – online, that puts more pressure on the home internet,” says Gilani. “One answer is to have your own separate connection – whether through your phone or a dedicated mobile broadband connection – which means you can do what you need to do without interrupting what the rest of the family does. You can then get on with client calls while another family member is playing Fortnite.” In a pandemic, these are good problems to have.Staying connected has never been more vital – and it often seems that everyone in the family wants to be online at the same time.

Any awkward moments?I ordered my food before the date so had to pop downstairs to pick it up 10 minutes in, which was a bit awkward and possibly poor form.Good table manners? Very good. I stupidly chose pad thai – who eats noodles on a date? I think I spent most of the time with my hand over my mouth. How long did you stay on the call?Almost four hours.Best thing about Alex?He is funny and charming. I laughed a lot, which was great.Did you introduce him to your housemates?I didn’t, but I did meet one of his.

Over to the experts …• Twenty masks for all occasionsNearly six months after the coronavirus overturned our lives, the face mask has finally, unequivocally, arrived. Until now, it’s had an image problem, but that thinking is shifting, fast. Amid growing evidence that the virus is transmitted through the air, refusing to wear one, particularly indoors, is increasingly becoming a social no-no – not to mention risky. The hashtag #wearadamnmask has been trending on both sides of the Atlantic for good reason.But look around, and you will see that people are confused. When do you wear one? Why haven’t some politicians been covering up? Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has a nice line in tartan masks, but Donald Trump and recovered Covid-19 patient Boris Johnson had resisted wearing them until very recently. Just last week, chancellor Rishi Sunak was criticised for serving Wagamama customers mask-less, a good-news photo opp that backfired. Yet, according to the ’s fashion editor Jess Cartner-Morley, face coverings “are the biggest thing to happen to the optics of our lives in a long time”, and for many of us a radical change to the face we present to the world. (Niqab wearers have always covered up, though you need to wear a mask under their highly breathable fabric, too.) Masks will be with us for as long as coronavirus is – and if they’re not ubiquitous this summer, you can bet they will be this autumn.What are the rules? In the UK, masks are currently compulsory on public transport, and in shops in Scotland (England follows suit from 24 July) meanwhile the World Health Organization (WHO) advises people wear one in any situation where social distancing isn’t possible. But beyond this official guidance, there are many unanswered questions. Should I wear one at work? How do I communicate better while wearing one? Do I need to rethink my hair and makeup, and is this the end of the beard? We’ve answered these burning questions, and more.Absolutely, according to Jeremy Howard, research scientist at the University of San Francisco and co-founder of campaigning group Masks 4 All, who has been analysing mask-wearing data since February. Unless you’re outside, and unlikely to spend more than five minutes in the company of someone closer than six feet, you need a mask.“Masks and social distancing are our strongest tools in fighting the virus,” he says. “The virus is transmitted through droplets of saliva, so a mask will always decrease the radius of those droplets. This is why opening pubs while the virus is still circulating is a terrible idea – you are usually talking straight at someone for a good length of time, so there’s a continuous spray of droplets. If you’re not wearing a mask, either indoors or out, you’re taking a huge risk.”“It’s important to fit it snugly over the nose. Use a pipe cleaner, or rolled up piece of foil, or paper clip in the top seam to mould the mask round your nose and make sure it covers your chin completely. Often, masks that tie round the back of your head are better than ear loops as they fit more tightly. Surgical or disposable paper masks are usually a less good fit, and less breathable.”You should always wear one in a shop, says Howard: “It’s as much about protecting the workers from your droplets.” Elsewhere, use your common sense. “If a bus stop isn’t overly sheltered or covered, and you can keep six feet away from others, then you don’t need to wear a mask. Most laws around the world are saying you should wear one indoors in public, or outdoors when you can’t socially distance. I would add – if you can’t socially distance ‘for some time’.” Workplaces, particularly offices, are high-risk environments for transmission, he says. Along with other measures, such as ventilation, distancing and talking quietly, wearing a mask is recommended. “Nothing is perfectly safe, but if everyone wears a mask, people are over six feet apart (including during meetings), loud speech, yawning, coughing and shouting are avoided, and you regularly move around the office, the spread of the virus will be greatly reduced. For all-day use, a breathable mask is important. If it gets wet from sweat or humidity, bring a second one to use as a replacement.”There is an art to wearing a mask. Charlotte Waite, a practising dentist and chair of the England Community Dental Services Committee, has worn a disposable surgical mask for years at work. “Wash your hands or use a hand gel, and pick up a clean mask by its loops,” she advises. “The inside is usually a lighter colour. Make sure it’s the right way up – there is a harder ridge at the top. Mould this over the bridge of your nose, pushing outwards. Tuck the bottom of your mask under your chin – you’re trying to achieve no gaps. If you do touch your mask, just wash your hands after.”Glasses wearers often complain about fogging up, but there is a knack to this. “Take them off first, fit the mask, then put them back on – they should sit on top of the mask. If the mask fits well, your glasses shouldn’t steam up.”According to a 2011 paper published by the Royal College of Surgeons, immediately before wearing a face mask you should wash your glasses with soapy water, and shake off the excess. Let the spectacles air dry or gently dry with a tissue before putting them back on.Surgical masks are designed to be thrown away after every use. “Put it in a bin or, if you’re out and about, in a plastic bag, and throw both the mask and bag away when you get home. If it gets damp, say from your breath, dispose of it immediately and put a new one on. If you’re using a fabric face covering, wash it after every use. If you’re out, either put it in a plastic bag to carry home or, for less waste, in a small canvas bag and put both in the wash.”People can feel hot or claustrophobic in a mask, she says, but once you get used to them you will start to relax. “Try not to unhook them or pull them under your chin or off your nose. Either wear it properly or take it off.” It’s useful to have at least three face coverings if they are reusable. According to the WHO, you should change them when they get dirty or wet, so always carry a spare in a sealable bag. The WHO advises you wash your fabric mask at least once a day – so follow the wash one, dry one, wear one rule.We are all comfortable with different levels of risk with mask-wearing comes a whole new register of social niceties. When is it polite to wear one, even if it’s not the law? “In towns and cities, where it’s difficult to avoid others, get into the habit of masking up, at least for now,” says etiquette expert, Debora Robertson, co-author of Manners: A Modern Field Guide (out next spring). “Not wearing one is like littering – an outward sign that you expect others to be the grownups. It’s a small price to pay for moving around more freely, and if you hate it, oh well – people once moaned about wearing seatbelts.”What’s the etiquette of meeting someone socially when they’re wearing a mask and you’re not? “If you don’t have one, respect their caution by keeping your distance,” Robertson says. “If you’re wearing one and your friend isn’t, don’t feel pressured to remove yours. Never ridicule anyone for wearing a mask and conversely, don’t mask-monitor others. Don’t berate people who aren’t wearing them, just move along, if for no other reason than that confrontation might result in them getting closer than you’d like.“Wear one when you’re in close proximity to others – at markets, the school gates, in shops. Understandably, a lot of people don’t want to wear masks when exercising outside. If you feel you really can’t, make sure you give other people a wide berth. In restaurants and bars, wear your mask when moving about. Keep it on while your order is being taken. Of course take it off to eat and drink, but replace it when you get up to leave or go to the loo.”Wearing masks makes it more difficult to read non-verbal cues, she adds. “Remember to smile with your eyes, and to say please and thank you. The more of us who wear masks, the more normal it becomes. If we think of it as a generous and thoughtful thing to do, it begins to feel like a very small burden.”Think of a face mask like the hat in a Christmas cracker. Embrace the good-hearted spirit behind it, fix your hair and keep your chin up.Shaking off any residual British awkwardness is the key to pulling off a mask in any style. Start by taking a long look at yourself in the mirror. A mask changes your face more radically than a new haircut or hair colour, or new glasses. Try on any different masks you have, and experiment by holding paler and darker scarves around the bottom half of your face, to see which shades suit you and which make you look shadowed and tired. If your masks have ribbons, then tie them firmly in place so you have permanent ear loops and snip off the excess – otherwise the ends will go rogue and stick out from your hair.When I bought my first batch, my instinct was to look for cheery fabrics and colours. We read masks as a danger sign, so I wanted to offset this. But having road tested jazzy colours and prints, I settled on plain white or black for the same reason I always fall back on plain black or white swimwear: when I’m out of my sartorial comfort zone, monochrome makes me feel less in the spotlight. Stretchy black ones work best for everyday (try Mango’s simple black design, £12.99 for a pack of two) I have a few smarter crisp, linen-white ones (try Edeline Lee’s Spunbond masks, £40 for a pack of three). The general rule is to apply your usual aesthetic filters to mask-wearing. If you enjoy wearing colourful scarves near your face (I don’t), then do try a printed mask.Dark glasses with a dark mask is tricky to pull off without looking like a cartoon villain. My sunglasses tip is to copy supermodel Karlie Kloss, who I saw photographed as a guest at a socially-distanced wedding, wearing a white shirt dress and white mask with black sunglasses, her hair pulled neatly back. In dark glasses, contrast with a paler mask is key so is wearing your hair up. When so much of your face is covered, exposing your jaw and neckline can soften and humanise.“We process information best when we can see the whole face, rather than inidual features such as eyes, nose and mouth separately,” says Rebecca Brewer, senior lecturer at Royal Holloway, University of London, whose research includes the recognition of emotion and identity from faces. “If we can’t do this, it can be harder to read someone’s emotions, or even recognise them.” Each horizontal half of the face, one dominated by the eyes and the other by the mouth, affects the other – known as the composite face effect, Brewer explains. In other words, what you’re doing with your mouth will change the way your eyes look. “Anger is especially communicated by the eye region,” says Brewer, “whereas other emotions are communicated better by the mouth – such as happiness and disgust. Still, people should be able to tell when we are smiling, as genuine smiles come with ‘creased’ eyes (known by psychologists as a Duchenne smile). Smiles which are posed tend to be displayed more by the mouth.”Losing these cues will have an effect on our social interactions. “We can usually tell if someone we’re talking to is, say, getting bored,” says Brewer, “so we adapt our behaviour. Wearing a mask makes these simple interactions harder, particularly when we’re with people we don’t know so well, or are meeting for the first time. It becomes harder still to pick up more subtle emotions – such as when someone is mildly amused, rather than laughing hysterically.”Women who already cover their faces with a niqab in public are used to all of these interactions. Dareen, who lives in Saudi Arabia, used to wear one but stopped as it exacerbated her asthma, particularly in summer. “When you’re wearing a niqab, even your eyebrows are covered, so you use your eyes, your hands and your tone of voice to express yourself,” she says. Wearing a niqab offers no protection against Covid-19 as the fabric is highly breathable, and they should be worn with a face mask underneath in public. Dareen worries that not enough women are doing this, particularly in enclosed spaces like shopping malls. “You can usually tell if someone is wearing a mask underneath. If they’re not, I keep away.”Dr Anna Piela, an academic and author of Wearing The Niqab (out next January), has reinterviewed some of her contributors since the start of the pandemic. Many told her they have found greater acceptance now that more people are covering up, she says. Loubna (a pseudonym) from Birmingham, says: “I went to a park the other day, and it felt completely different. Usually people do a double-take when they see me there with my kids, but this time, everyone was wearing a mask. There was an expectation that your face would be covered, and my niqab was just one other way of fulfilling that expectation. I felt inconspicuous, and it was so refreshing.” When paying greater attention to other cues, such as facial expressions and body language, we can learn a lot from performers, says Welsh theatre actor, Caroline Sheen. “Silent movie stars like Mary Pickford and Charlie Chaplin perfected the art of expressing emotion through gestures,” she says. “Exaggerated eyebrow movements, heavy eyeliner, head tilts, putting your hands to your head – these all emphasise what you’re trying to say.”When it comes to wearing a mask, it helps to understand your own face better. “We actors study our faces a lot. Look hard at yours in the mirror, and work out how it reacts. For example, I frown a lot naturally, so I’ve learned to overcompensate for that by smiling more.” Meanwhile Sheen’s own profession may rely on more face coverings, at least in the near future. “We project our voices, we sing – and that’s hazardous when it comes to the spread of the virus.”As for “smizing” or smiling with your eyes, models – specifically Tyra Banks, who coined the term nearly a decade ago – are the real experts. According to Banks, you relax your mouth, think of something or someone you love, and squint with a fierce intensity. If that comes across a bit too Melania Trump, then soften it slightly, creasing your eyes.There’s an old beauty industry cliche about how, in times of crisis, lipstick sales hold steady as women buy little luxuries for cheer and paint on a brave face for fortitude. Coronavirus may just be the first crisis where lipstick may prove more trouble than it’s worth, smudging messily under face coverings, staining masks and sticking to fabric.There’s an argument for ditching it altogether. “This is just not the time for makeup on the bottom third of the face,” says Val Garland, makeup artist and judge on the BBC reality show Glow Up. “It’s better to keep the lower skin clean, fresh and moisturised.” She is forgoing foundation as well, dabbing concealer only where needed. If going base-free is a bridge too far for you, try a facial self-tanner before bed instead. It evens tone, gives skin a healthy glow and doesn’t rub off. When your PPE comes on and off constantly for speaking and eating, makeup will ultimately just wipe away and dirty your mask.Garland advises reaching first for the eyelash curlers to really open up the eyes. She uses a grey or black eyeliner (brown suits me better) to line tightly top and bottom, then takes an angled brush and smudges upwards, softening any hard lines. But don’t be too hasty in banishing the lipstick. What used to be for going out is now for staying in, Garland says: save it for Zoom.Pharmacist Gareth Thomas wears a fluid-resistant mask for work, but was advised to shave his full beard off. “The advice is that facial hair mustn’t cross the edge of the mask. So goatees and moustaches are fine, as long as they are contained within the mask. I opted for a goatee – but it rubs against the mask and pulls it down when I’m talking.” Going clean-shaven might be your best option.Different types of mask offer different levels of protection, with the evidence on any, other than surgical masks, still emerging. Surgical grade N95 respirators offer the highest level of protection, followed by surgical grade masks (also known as “medical” masks, ie those with several layers of protection). However, these masks are costly, in limited supply, contribute to landfill and are uncomfortable to wear for long periods, so they are generally reserved for healthcare workers, or those at particularly high risk. The WHO also advises these be worn by people over 60, or those with underlying health conditions, where social distancing isn’t possible.It’s worth seeking your doctor’s advice if you’re concerned about a health condition such as asthma. Jessica Kirby, Asthma UK’s head of health advice, says most sufferers won’t have a problem wearing a mask: “They won’t do any damage – and if you feel fine wearing one, you are fine. But for some, it may make them feel like they can’t catch a breath – and that anxiety will make their breathing worse. If that happens, take the mask off. My advice is to try out a few different types, and go for a walk around the block wearing them.”• Main photo: Styling: Melanie Wilkinson.

They’ve been together for more than 20 years, through the best of times and the worst of times, and their commitment to each other remains unshakeable.Things were on-again, off-again for some time but when Janet came back from a stint overseas, she moved into Jo’s sharehouse.In 2000, they moved into a small flat overlooking Sydney Harbour. It was a significant year for the pair. As the city celebrated the Olympics, they worked hard and played hard. But there was also a series of family deaths that shook them deeply. Supporting each other through their grief drew them closer together: “When death happens at an early stage of the relationship, you will actually cement the foundation, or you won’t have a foundation and the relationship will drift apart,” Janet says. “You have deep conversations.”Their personalities are different but complementary: Jo is quiet and reserved while Janet is outgoing and talkative. And there’s rarely any conflict between them: “When I get pissed off and I’m sternly talking to Janet, she just laughs. And when she giggles, I start giggling and so it dissipates the issue,” Jo says.Both say honesty is a fundamental part of their relationship: “When you tell someone you’re ashamed of something you’ve done in the past and they let you forgive yourself or they don’t shame you, I think that’s extraordinary,” Janet says. Jo agrees: “There’s no judgment by either of us.”Once the relationship was cemented, Jo shared her battle with mental health with her partner. She suffers from bipolar disorder and suicidal ideation. Janet encouraged her to seek help from a therapist, which she did: “I think that was the turning point, if I didn’t try and heal Jo, I didn’t try and take responsibility, I went, ‘That’s quite a big thing.’”But over time, Jo’s mental health declined. “My mental illness is a big challenge to our relationship,” she says now, “and I am so grateful, appreciative and fortunate that I have Janet as my advocate, as a carer, as a partner.”The next few years were very difficult: “As a partner, I am an advocate, a pain in the arse to some doctors, and a witness to Jo’s personal trauma,” Janet says, adding “some of that I’m not witness to.” Janet tried to help where she could: “When Jo was at her worst, in the early days when neither of us knew what was really going on, I just told her, ‘Blink, it’s going to be over. Blink, this time will pass. Just blink, it’s finished. It’s a moment.’”Janet dealt with the crisis by researching and learning as much as she could about bipolar disorder. Seeking help outside of the relationship was important, she says: “You’ve got to be willing to not just go, ‘well, let’s see how we go together,’ because we would be melted on the floor by now if we relied on our own skills.” Janet and Jo recommend support organisations such as the 24-hour counselling service Suicide Callback Service and the US organisation To Write Love on Her Arms.Eventually, Jo was discharged and Janet became her full-time carer. It’s difficult for both, but they’ve coped with it in the only way they know: “Janet brings a lot of creativity to our relationship in the way she does things, in the way she tells stories, in the way she looks at the world. I think that keeps us together,” Jo says with a smile.Over time, Jo has improved, although it’s an ongoing battle. She recently checked herself into hospital to help her to come off some of her medication. “I was overloaded with medication and I was very numb, very wooden. I’ve stripped away a lot of those drugs now, I’ve just got a few that I’m taking now and I am thinking more, I am talking more, I am more responsive to things. It’s good.” When we speak, she’s out of hospital and continues to receive treatment.A year ago, the couple exchanged rings. Marriage is not for them but they wanted to mark their 20 years together. “We witnessed to each other that we have survived,” Janet says.Love and laughter has kept them strong. “Every now and then I’ll turn and look at Jo while she’s asleep or while she’s playing solitaire and my heart swells with love,” says Janet. They dote on each other when they can: “Jo really cares for me when she’s out of hospital, I get really looked after and I like to luxuriate in it because I’m a sensualist and there’s a lot of care,” Janet says.Showing each other respect and old-fashioned manners helps too: “We thank each other, we say please, we say goodnight. It’s honest, it’s sincere,” Jo says. And there are plenty of hugs too.• Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14 Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467 Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800 MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78• We want to hear your stories about staying together.

His term of office finishes in 2022 but a successor will be chosen a year earlier, according to a report in the Times.It follows an announcement by the Unison leader, Dave Prentis, that he would be stepping down at the end of the year, while Tim Roache stood down as general secretary of the GMB in April citing ill health. The GMB later said it had received an anonymous letter in which “a number of allegations have been made about Tim’s conduct” while he was leader.The race to succeed McCluskey, 69, has already begun. Steve Turner, one of the union’s assistant general secretaries, has submitted his nomination to be the candidate of United Left, a broad-left organisation within the union.The section is holding a hustings on Saturday with Turner and Howard Beckett nominated as candidates. The hustings were announced when it was believed McCluskey’s term would finish in April 2022.At the time the hustings was announced in early July, a Unite spokesman said: “Len McCluskey’s term as Unite general secretary ends in April 2022. There are therefore no present plans for an election for his successor.“Unofficial groups within the union and potential candidates are free to plan for the eventual election as they please, but for the union as a whole the priority, of course, remains protecting members’ jobs, safety and living standards through this dreadful pandemic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a1fb473196234846d83819d1def9916c0ed4faf/0_180_3445_2068/master/3445.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b239c56be27b2b11ce9abed0be412bf","title":"matt hancock in new u turn on coronavirus testing data","story":"Health secretary finally bows to pressure to hand over full facts about positive tests to council health officialsThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, has bowed to pressure from councils, which demanded full access to the names and data of people in their areas who tested positive for Covid-19, and those with whom they have been in contact, in another major government U-turn.Local authorities and public health officials have been complaining for weeks that they are being hampered in efforts to combat and prevent local outbreaks by lack of access to “named patient data” which would allow them to get straight to the sources of local outbreaks.Now the Observer has been told that Hancock, who has insisted repeatedly that local authorities have all the information they need from the track and trace system, is set to give way and allow access to the named data as well other information already provided, such as postcodes, so long as strict data protection rules and conditions are followed.A source close to Hancock said on Saturday night that an announcement was imminent and could come as soon as Monday.“Subject to necessary data safeguards, we will enhance the level of this detail to ensure that local public health teams on the ground have the information they need to fight this virus,” the source said.He added: “High quality use of data is critical to providing good public services. We’re providing more and more detailed data to local directors of public health who sign data protection agreements, to help them tackle local outbreaks and hunt down this virus.”Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester who has been pressing for named patient data to be handed over for weeks, so that local health experts can act to protect people in workplaces and elsewhere who may have been infected, welcomed the about turn but said it should have happened much earlier.He said: “It is good that the Government has finally acknowledged the truth of what we’ve been saying for weeks: that local teams need access to named patient data, ideally on a daily basis, if they are to mount the most effective effort on the ground to contain this virus. Despite claims to the contrary, even from the Despatch Box, this has not been happening.“However, it should not have taken this long, and such a public campaign, to force them to comply with their own law. Going forward, it would be in the Government’s own best interests to involve, consult and listen to local leaders much more. The stark reality is that we are heading into a dangerous winter without a vaccine and councils will need every bit of help they can get if they are to be able to protect their communities.”Under the new arrangements, Public Health England is expected to provide the names and data of those people who tested positive and their contacts to directors of public health working with local authorities.The latest shift on Covid-19 – following recent U-turns on plans for a tracing app and free school meals for the poorest children – comes after an announcement by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday that councils are to be given new powers to close shops, cancel events and shut outdoor spaces to manage local outbreaks.Boris Johnson has described the government’s £10bn track and trace system as “world beating” but council chiefs and local directors of public health have been demanding full data access so they can work in tandem with the national track and trace system, using their local expertise, with full information at their fingertips.Government officials said last night that Hancock had been keen on granting full access to named patient data for some time and was “very keen” on the change – despite having appeared repeatedly to deny that local authorities were been deprived of the information they needed.Louise Jackson, portfolio holder for public health and wellbeing at Bedford Council, said the flow of data had improved but there were still important gaps.“We are now getting full postcode-level data, but it’s still only being sent through weekly to local authorities, so it’s not real time. It’s not patient identifiable either. If Ministers are suggesting otherwise, then that is not true.”Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “Councils and public health officials have been banging on Hancock’s door for weeks. The government says it is a world beating system but it has cost £10bn and yet local experts have not been getting the data they need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3e6e77693a7a831c064bd8deb326e05b091a631/396_0_3208_1925/master/3208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e19deb1505fdb527ecd1b994412704c4","title":"ministers ignore pleas to honour vow and bring innocents back from syria","story":"After last week’s Shamima Begum ruling, Home Office stays silent on rescue of minors from camps in the north-west of the countryThe Home Office has been accused of “alarming inaction” after making no apparent attempt to bring back any British children from Syria for the past eight months despite pledges of help from ministers.The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, announced last October that “unaccompanied minors or orphans” in Syria could be returned to Britain. After three orphans returned in November, he hailed the move as “the right thing to do”. He added: “These innocent, orphaned children should never have been subjected to the horrors of war.”Boris Johnson described the children’s repatriation as “a great success”.But an estimated 60 or so British minors are still trapped in north-east Syria, and the government has repeatedly refused to say when any of them will be allowed to return home.The home secretary, Priti Patel, has so far not responded to a letter from Save the Children, sent last December, in which the charity asked how she intended to start bringing them home. Since then, the charity has repeatedly asked Home Office officials for a progress report on its attempts to repatriate unaccompanied children and orphans stranded in refugee camps but says it has been stonewalled.The latest accusations follow Thursday’s ruling that Shamima Begum, currently in north-east Syria after leaving London at 15 to marry an Islamic State fighter, should be allowed home. The Court of Appeal said the 20-year-old, one of three east London girls who went to Syria in 2015, could only properly appeal against the government’s decision to revoke her citizenship if she came back to the UK. However, there is growing concern that the government will do nothing to assist her return.Yesterday her family said that any attempt by the UK government to keep Begum in Syria would be defeated. Tasnime Akunjee, the family’s lawyer, said: “However determined this particular government is in keeping Shamima Begum out, I can assure them that the family are more determined to bring her to safety”.Akunjee felt that the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces, who control the camp where Begum is being held, would be willing to help assist with her repatriation because of the court’s judgment.“If we have a court ruling saying that the British government must accept her but they are not moving on it, then it’ll be up to us to convince the SDF that that’s good enough,” said Akunjee. Orlaith Minogue, conflict and humanitarian advocacy adviser for Save the Children, said she was “extremely frustrated” over the British government’s refusal to help the plight of the British children.“We’ve repeatedly tried to engage the Home Office and Foreign Office on a progress report about what is happening and the state of the children’s safety, but we have received no further information or what steps have been taken. We are concerned at the alarming inaction,” she said.Other European countries, however, have made recent efforts to repatriate vulnerable citizens.Last month, the French government brought home 10 French children of suspected Isis fighters from north-east Syria.Since Isis was ousted in March 2019, France has repatriated a total of 28 children from Syria. By contrast, the UK has brought back three orphans, and only then under significant political and public pressure.Meanwhile, the legal charity Reprieve reiterated calls for British mothers to be returned along with the children. There are currently more than 20 British families believed to be held in refugee camps in north-east Syria.“Children deserve to be given support to rebuild their lives in the UK and any charges that the adults face should be handled by the British justice system in British courts,” said Reprieve director Maya Foe.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK does more to support unaccompanied children than any EU member state”.They added that coronavirus had suspended all refugee resettlement activity, but would restart “as soon as possible once conditions allow”.Kazakhstan: 600 More than 600 of its citizens have been repatriated from Syria, of which over 400 are children and at least 150 are women.Uzbekistan: 148 At least 148 Uzbek women and children linked to Islamic State have been returned from north-east Syria.Kosovo: 106 At least 74 children and 32 women have been returned from Syria.Russia: 35 The country has repatriated at least 35 orphans from Syria.France: 28 Has so far helped 28 children get home from Syria.United States: 23 The US has returned at least 23 people, including 15 children.UK: 3 To date has repatriated three orphans from Syria."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/629f79cf0cf1a16bd135cd334c5d4f31319da970/0_289_4494_2696/master/4494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeb415f88577aa02921a0ae95aa06dfc","title":"no deal brexit poorly prepared companies coronavirus","story":"Nearly two-thirds of companies have made no plans at all, thinktank warns MPsSee all our coronavirus coverageMany companies are now less prepared for a no-deal Brexit than they were a year ago and have yet to make any preparations for such an outcome, ministers are being warned.As a result of the coronavirus crisis, stockpiles have been wound down, Brexit-related staff redeployed and cashflows seriously depleted. Yet a potential no-deal outcome is now less than six months away.It also warns that last-minute preparations will be extremely difficult for many sectors, as coronavirus-related government support is wound down and potential for stockpiling is diminished as warehouses fill up ahead of Christmas.“The coronavirus crisis has not only held up progress on Brexit preparations but, in some areas, has actually set businesses back,” it warns in a new report.“Firms reeling from the economic consequences of coronavirus are poorly placed to prepare for Brexit: in many cases, they’re in a worse position than in the months leading up to the potential no-deal in October 2019. As the government’s own data shows, the majority of firms have not even begun to prepare.“Many businesses and public bodies have run down stockpiles built up ahead of a potential no-deal Brexit last year, either because it was not economically viable to maintain excess supplies or to mitigate the disruption caused by gaps and delays in supply chains caused by the coronavirus. Many firms have eaten into ‘rainy day’ cash reserves just to stay afloat – money that could otherwise have been used to prepare for Brexit.”Ministers recently conceded that many checks for goods coming into Britain would not be enforced when the transition period comes to an end, despite a previous insistence that controls would be in place. However, ministers have continued to stress that there will be no extension of the transition period.There are now mounting calls for sector-specific help ahead of the end of the transition period. The cost of extra customs declarations could be as much as £7bn a year, according to some estimates.“With such a deal, a strong recovery is possible, safeguarding the industry and our reputation as an attractive destination for foreign investment. In the meantime, we urgently need the government to introduce sector-specific measures to support cashflow, such as business rate holidays, tax cuts and policies to boost consumer confidence.”Industry groups have also been urging members to make preparations where they can, especially among exporting companies. Dominic Goudie, head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation, said: “There are many things that businesses can and should be doing to prepare, and we are helping ensure our industry has the very best chance of being ready as further clarity emerges from the government about what will be required.“Many producers have been seriously affected by the closure of the hospitality sector, while staff have been redeployed from Brexit preparations to focus on the Covid-19 pandemic.“Businesses have seen their cashflow badly impacted, and this risks further reducing their limited capacity to stockpile short shelf-life ingredients and finished products.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/534a66f0ee989dd573422517a84918f010f2653a/0_0_3218_2145/master/3218.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1e0a08f1790f39428cf3326c54c14421 1320w","title":"have you become unemployed due to coronavirus","story":"Following news that almost 650,000 people have left company payrolls since March, we would like to hear from those who have lost their jobs due to coronavirusThe number of people on company payrolls in the UK has dropped by almost 650,000 since March, as unemployment continues to soar due to the coronavirus pandemic.We would like to hear from people who have lost their jobs as a result of coronavirus over the last three months.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

He became a congressman in 1987.“He loved this country so much that he risked his life and his blood so that it might live up to its promise,” Obama wrote in a Medium post. “And through the decades, he not only gave all of himself to the cause of freedom and justice, but inspired generations that followed to try to live up to his example.”Winfrey released footage of Lewis speaking during a recorded conversation between the two last week. Posting the footage, Winfrey wrote: “He sounded weak but was surprisingly more alert than we expected. I had a final chance to tell him what I’ve said every time I’ve been in his presence: ‘Thank you for your courage leading the fight for freedom. My life as it is would not have been possible without you.’“I know for sure he heard me. I felt good about that. He understood and was so gracious.”In the interview, shot to mark a CNN documentary entitled John Lewis: Good Trouble, the congressman said: “I tried to do what was right, fair and just. When I was growing up in rural Alabama, my mother always said, ‘Boy, don’t get in trouble … but I saw those signs that said ‘white’, ‘colored’, and I would say, ‘Why?’“And she would say again, ‘Don’t get in trouble. You will be beaten. You will go to jail. You may not live. But … the words of Dr King and the actions of Rosa Parks inspired me to get in trouble. And I’ve been getting in trouble ever since. Good trouble. Necessary trouble.”Lewis was a prominent figure in many key events of the civil rights era, prominent among them the March on Washington in 1963 and a voting rights march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in 1965 on what would come to be known as Bloody Sunday.State troopers attacked peaceful protesters with clubs and tear gas. A police officer knocked Lewis to the ground and hit him in the head with a nightstick, then struck him again as he tried to get up, he would later testify in court.Images of Lewis being beaten are some of the most enduring of the era. Film of events in Selma was shown on national television, galvanizing support for the Voting Rights Act.Pettus, for whom the bridge is named, was a slaveholding member of the Confederate army, a leader in the Klu Klux Klan and a man “bent on preserving slavery and segregation”, Smithsonian Magazine wrote.Lewis was the son of sharecroppers in Alabama but represented a Georgia district for 33 years in the US House of Representatives. In one of his last public appearances, he walked a street in front of the White House in Washington painted with a Black Lives Matter mural, a tribute to a movement he saw as a continuation of his fight for racial equality.Politicians paid tribute on Saturday, among them former presidents Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter and George W Bush, House speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and, with a tweet and an order for flags to fly at half-staff, Donald Trump.Ava DuVernay, the academy award-nominated director of the historical drama film Selma, a retelling of the 1965 march, wrote that she would “never forget what you taught me and what you challenged me to be”.“Better. Stronger. Bolder. Braver. God bless you, Ancestor John Robert Lewis of Troy, Alabama. Run into His arms.”Viola Davis, the first black actress to win a Tony, an Emmy and an Oscar, thanked Lewis for his “commitment to change” and “courage”. In one of Davis’s most famous roles, in the 2011 film The Help, she portrayed a maid in the Jim Crow south, a role she has since said catered to a white audience not “ready for the truth” about the black experience.Stacey Abrams, who lost a race to become Georgia’s first black female governor after voting rolls were purged by her Republican opponent, called Lewis “a griot of this modern age”. Abrams’ organization Fair Fight continues to work to secure voting rights, a central demand of marchers in Selma.Minister Bernice A King, the youngest daughter of Martin Luther King Jr and Coretta Scott King, said Lewis “did, indeed, fight the good fight and get into a lot of good trouble”, thereby ensuring he “served God and humanity well”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96c61ef59edee3e2ccb51141b3d81021c91aa86d/0_18_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0385be6dc229d9f0fd32e630eaacdaa0","title":"kanye west petition south carolina ballot 2020","story":"Rapper asks supporters to sign petition calling for him to be added to state’s ballot as doubts persist over how seriously to take his bidKanye West has asked fans to sign a petition calling for him to be added to the presidential election ballot in South Carolina.The rap superstar announced he was running for the White House on 4 July, tweeting: “We must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future. I am running for president of the United States.”But doubts persist over how seriously to take his bid.West, who has both expressed support for Donald Trump and said he has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, has said he will model his White House on a fictional land in the Black Panther superhero film, saying: “Let’s get back to Wakanda.”This week it emerged he has qualified to appear on the presidential ballot in Oklahoma after making Wednesday’s deadline to register as an independent candidate. But it appears he missed the cut-off to run in South Carolina. According to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), that state also had a deadline of Wednesday.Apparently hoping public opinion can sway officials, he tweeted: “If you’re a voter in South Carolina, please sign this petition to place me on the ballot Sponsored by Ye 2020.”The online petition is paid for by the Kanye 2020 political committee, which filed paperwork with the FEC this week, indicating West, who is married to the reality TV star Kim Kardashian West, is serious about running.Ben Jacobs, a former  reporter now filing for New York Magazine who has followed West’s moves closely, reported that the rapper started to make moves to get on the ballot in Florida before pulling back. After missing the ballot deadline in the Sunshine state, West did file to be on the ballot in Oklahoma, which simply requires a check.On Saturday, Jacobs reported that petitions were available to be signed in nine locations across South Carolina. One host told the magazine people had been coming in “off and on” to sign the petition for West.The Kanye 2020 committee has filed a statement organisation form, also known as FEC Form 1. The next step would be filing a statement of candidacy, or FEC Form 2.That is filed when an inidual has raised or spent more than $5,000 on campaign activity, triggering candidacy status.

It lifted most of the restrictions a month later to relieve the impact of the closures on its ailing economy.Australia postponed the next sitting of its national parliament as cases continued to surge in and around its second-largest city, Melbourne. A second lockdown has been imposed on the southern state of Victoria, weeks after the initial wave of restrictions was lifted and community transmission briefly appeared to have been eradicated.The national body will be suspended for two weeks to account for the risk of politicians in Victoria spreading the virus to the capital, Canberra, and the surrounding state of New South Wales, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said on Saturday.“The risks posed by a parliamentary sitting are significantly higher and unlikely to be resolved in the next month,” he said.As the global count of cases being tracked by Johns Hopkins University crossed 14m, with nearly 600,000 deaths, France announced that masks would be made mandatory in enclosed public spaces including banks, shops and indoor markets starting on Monday.The reproduction rate of the virus in the Brittany region has risen sharply in the past weeks, raising fears the virus may be regaining momentum in the country.The WHO reported the greatest daily increase in global cases, with the total rising by 237,743 in the 24 hours to Saturday. The biggest increases were reported in the US, Brazil, India and South Africa.Cases in the US grew by more than 76,000, a record for the world’s worst-hit country.In a lecture for the Nelson Mandela Foundation, delivered online, the UN secretary-general António Guterres said the pandemic had revealed, like an x-ray, “fractures in the fragile skeleton of the societies we have built”.“It is exposing fallacies and falsehoods everywhere: the lie that free markets can deliver healthcare for all the fiction that unpaid care work is not work the delusion that we live in a post-racist world the myth that we are all in the same boat,” said Guterres, a former Socialist prime minister of Portugal.He added that the coronavirus outbreak had created a “generational opportunity” to build a more equal, sustainable world. “Because while we are all floating on the same sea, it’s clear that some are in superyachts while others are clinging to the floating debris,” Guterres said.The UN has appealed for $10.3bn (£8.2bn) to help poor states, but has received only $1.7bn.China launched mass health screenings in the western Xinjiang province after a spike in cases raised fears of a fresh outbreak. Flights into the regional capital Ürümqi were suspended along with the city’s subway services after 17 cases were found on Saturday.“The whole city has entered a ‘wartime state’, and will suspend all kinds of group activities,” state media quoted an official giving a briefing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f0f6a2ef5d1d0e4f05f003bc1d600c06f23c6db/0_529_7088_4254/master/7088.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a8081ffe4ac352f4ca97a43b80b87f3","title":"covid 19 cases us icu beds south west","story":"Covid-19 cases are surging across much of the American south and west, as familiar scenes of weary doctors and nurses in packed hospitals replay across a whole new region.In Washington, Congress is gearing up to pass another economic stimulus package. Optimistic economists once thought such a package could be unnecessary, but Covid-19 is now expected to continue to hurt the economy.The US is now logging more than 70,000 new Covid-19 infections a day, according to Johns Hopkins University, up from a low of around 20,000 in early June.Nearly 3.7 million people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 and more than 139,000 have died since January, when the disease was first found in the US.“People continue to regard the virus as a political scheme or conspiracy theory,” Dr Chad Dowell, a doctor in Indianola, Mississippi, said in a Facebook post released by South Sunflower county hospital.“People continue to ignore recommended guidelines on how to help slow the virus’ spread. People continue to complain about wearing a mask. We’ve got to do better as a community.”Experts consider rising hospitalization rates a likely harbinger for a surge in US deaths, which as a lagging indicator, have remained relatively low. In the last week, hospitals from Florida to southern California have filled with patients in need of intensive care.“All of our ICU beds are full,” Dr Risa Moriarity, the University of Mississippi medical center executive vice-chair, emergency medicine, told local news station WAPT. “We have patients in the emergency department who need ICU beds. They’re on ventilators.”At the same hospital, Dr Andy Wilhelm, the head of intensive care, told WAPT: “When you’re on a hamster wheel, and a lot of people die, it’s tiring”.At Tampa general hospital in Florida, Dr Jason Wilson, the associate medical director, told the Washington Post: “We can withstand a disaster. But we can’t withstand a disaster every single day.“How many jumbo jet crashes can you handle before you run out of capacity? That’s what we’re facing.”Florida officials are dealing with what appears to be an uncontrolled rise in infections.“It took us 100 days to reach the first thousand cases,” said Patricia Boswell, a state department of health administrator in Volusia county, which encompasses the Daytona Beach metro area, according to the Daytona News-Journal.“Then, it took 12 days to reach the second thousand cases. Nine days to reach the third thousand cases, and six days later, to exceed 4,000 cases on 13 June. In the past three days, we’ve had more than 600 cases reported in Volusia.”Last spring, Congress approved the largest ever stimulus package, of $2.2tn in aid. That money went to help flagging businesses shut down by the pandemic, and gave people on unemployment an additional $600 a week.Republicans are demanding businesses receive liability protection from Covid-19-related injuries, as a part of the new aid package. The Trump administration has provided mixed signals about what it would approve.Trump himself has repeatedly claimed the US should do fewer tests, so fewer cases will be confirmed.“Senate Republicans have asked for funding to help states purchase test kits in bulk,” he said. “As it currently stands, the main bottleneck to a big ramp-up in testing is less technical than the White House’s own intransigence.”The White House declined to comment.Even amid the pandemic, Republicans are still hoping to hold local and national conventions, in line with the president’s desire for large crowds to cheer him on in the 2020 campaign.Republicans in Texas are locked in a court battle to try to salvage the remainder of their state convention. They had hoped to bring thousands to a convention center in Houston, currently one of the worst Covid-19 hotspots in the nation.City officials cancelled the convention on the grounds it would become a “super-spreader” event. Texas Republicans sued, and were blocked on appeal, to be left with a virtual-only convention although delegates have arrived in the city, according to Bloomberg News.The growing pandemic sets an ominous tone for the Republican National Convention, currently set to take place in Jacksonville, Florida, in late August. It has already moved once.Officials in Charlotte, North Carolina, barred the convention in their city, after Covid-19 cases began to rise. In 2016, 50,000 people flooded into Cleveland, Ohio, for the Republican convention. Local officials will require masks at the Jacksonville convention, which will be scaled back. The Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel announced this week 7,000 people would be allowed to attend the largest event, Trump’s acceptance speech, the Washington Post reported."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aef0e4bb1d22ed8123f3126898decfa1ab9db42/0_126_6586_3950/master/6586.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7e59d77b92f43dfd40d0a6d8ed7aae5","title":"eu leaders reconvene after stormy talks over 750bn recovery package","story":"Claim of miserliness as second day sees negotiations split over size of fund and seven-year budget European Union leaders agreed to reconvene at noon on Sunday after spending Saturday evening locked in intense negotiations in an attempt to save a summit on the terms of a €750bn (£682bn) pandemic recovery fund from an acrimonious end as the debate over the bloc’s financial future became “heated”. A second day of talks in Brussels saw Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, publicly accuse the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark and Sweden of being “misers” while the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, claimed the Dutch were trying to rewrite the EU’s rules.“We are stalled, it is proving very complicated, more complicated than expected, there are many discussions on what we are discussing that we are unable to resolve,” Conte said in a video message on his Facebook page on Saturday evening.The leaders are split over both the size of a recovery fund and the seven-year budget due to start next year. There is also stark ision over the nature of the conditions attached to the emergency funding and the balance between grants and loans on offer to countries hit by the crisis.Latvia’s prime minister, Krišjānis Kariņš, tweeted: “Today there is a heated debate about the multi-annual budget and the reconstruction fund in order to reach an agreement.”Charles Michel, the president of the European council, tabled a new set of proposals on Saturday morning in an attempt to reboot negotiations following a stormy 13 hours of talks on Friday.Under Michel’s proposal for the recovery fund, the level of grants would be reduced from the €500bn initially proposed by €50bn. But the northern member states are seeking to cut that further.The Netherlands, among others, wants tough conditions on the distribution of funds, especially in the context of the Polish and Hungarian governments, which have faced accusations of failing to respect the rule of law.The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, has insisted he cannot be expected to take on extra national debt in order for the EU to make cash payments to member states without his parliament having a say. Boyko Borissov, the Bulgarian prime minister, had accused his fellow leader on the first day of talks of wanting to be “the police of Europe”.Michel’s latest gambit was welcomed by a senior Dutch diplomat. “In the end this is a package and there are many more issues to solve. But the proposals on governance as put forward by Michel are a serious step in the right direction. Many issues remain and whether we get there will depend on the next 24 hours.”On the long-term budget, Michel is also offering an increase of €50m to the annual Austrian rebate and an extra €25m per year for Denmark and Sweden.Morawiecki gave his reading of the situation in a tweet: “There is a group of countries that we call a group of misers, and they call themselves frugal, who want a smaller contribution to the budget, which we call the budget for rebuilding Europe.”The proposed change in the proportion of grants and loans in the recovery fund is facing opposition from Italy.“We are negotiating hard with the Netherlands but also with other so-called frugal countries that do not share the need for such a substantial response, especially with regard to subsidies, but they also question loans,” the country’s prime minister said.The summit is being extended for another day, with a source close to its chairman, Charles Michel, saying the leaders would be handed new proposals before they reconvene at noon on Sunday.If the EU leaders fail to find a compromise this weekend, a second summer summit in the last week of July could be on the cards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdf1655ed2f2f71d591146184c7fef1d826696b0/0_142_3898_2340/master/3898.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eec3af27bdd3dd1b880167571c423b6e","title":"john lewis from civil rights titan to black lives matter","story":"The late congressman’s lifelong fight for equality mirrored the US’s racial strugglesHe was the youngest speaker at the March on Washington in 1963. More than half a century later, he stood outside the White House surveying the words “Black Lives Matter” painted on a street. John Lewis’s story was in many ways America’s story and testament to its unfinished journey.Lewis, a titan of the civil rights movement, died on Friday at the age of 80, severing a vital link with the generation that rose in the 60s to resist the US’s version of racial apartheid. The news was met with a depth of grief normally reserved for former presidents. Lewis transcended party politics and was truly admired and beloved.He grew up on a farm in rural Alabama, a short walk from the cotton fields of the Jim Crow south. Lewis, who had ambitions to be a minister, tried out his oratory by preaching to the family chickens. He went to segregated public schools and was denied a library card because of the colour of his skin, but he was an avid reader of books and newspapers and was inspired by the sound of Martin Luther King’s sermons on the radio.Lewis wrote to King seeking support to become the first black student at his local college, and became a fellow advocate of nonviolent protest, civil disobedience and, as he put it to the end, “good trouble”. But this was never to be mistaken for a lack of radicalism or willingness to put himself on the line: he was arrested 40 times from 1960 to 1966.Lewis organised sit-ins at whites-only lunch counters and volunteered as a Freedom Rider, enduring beatings and arrests while challenging segregated interstate travel. He helped form the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and became its chairman.This made him, aged 23, an organiser of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963. “We do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now,” he told the huge crowd from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, shortly before King delivered his “I have a dream” speech.Two years later, truncheon-wielding state troopers beat Lewis and fractured his skull as he led 600 protesters over the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. TV images of the state-sponsored carnage stunned the nation, paving the way for the landmark Voting Rights Act.Lewis wrote in his memoirs: “The American public had already seen so much of this sort of thing, countless images of beatings and dogs and cursing and hoses. But something about that day in Selma touched a nerve deeper than anything that had come before.” A campaign is under way to rename the bridge after Lewis, who returned there often.He took the battle for equality to the halls of Washington, winning a seat in the House of Representatives in 1986 and becoming known as the conscience of the US Congress, where he represented a Georgia district for 33 years.Visitors to his office, brimming with photographs and memorabilia, were treated to anecdotes, humility and wisdom in his soft, slow southern lilt. He fought many losing policy battles but, even as an old lion in his 70s, he was leading a sit-in protest in the House chamber demanding tougher gun controls.He lived to see the election of the US’s first black president, Barack Obama, then a racial backlash in the form of Donald Trump, and then an eruption of mass protests against racial injustice that both echoed and dwarfed the marches of the 1960s.Lewis refused to attend Trump’s inauguration or State of the Union addresses. In one of his final media appearances after being diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer, he walked a street near the White House painted with a Black Lives Matter mural.He saw the movement as another chapter in the cause that was his life’s work, inspiring countless younger men and women. “Generations from now,” said Obama, presenting the 2010 medal of freedom to Lewis, “when parents teach their children what is meant by courage, the story of John Lewis will come to mind – an American who knew that change could not wait for some other person or some other time whose life is a lesson in the fierce urgency of now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07082b8f1c2d8a6dc322c2794e1e323ebfad404a/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f52df07f6808e7adcd5d1572f383618c","title":"coronavirus live news who reports record global case rise as sydney tightens overseas arrivals","story":"New measure comes into force at 11.59pm on Wednesday as city announces 363 new cases global deaths pass 600,000 Sydney to limit overseas arrivals to 350 per day from Monday Restrictions tightened in Barcelona.

The restaurant was closed last night and is being cleaned and all close contacts are being identified.NSW Health is directing everyone who attended Holy Duck! restaurant in Chippendale on 10 July between 7.15pm and 9.30pm to immediately self-isolate for 14 days. Anyone who develops Covid-19 symptoms should be tested and stay in isolation for a full 14 days even if their test is negative.A case has also been found in someone who visited the Anytime fitness gym in Merrylands.

It had been due to end tonight, 19 July:I just want to begin firstly by explaining that given we have an continuing public health emergency this morning, I have extended the state of emergency forVictoria until 11.59pm on 16 August and that decision has been made acting on the advice of the chief health officer, given that we continue to see rising case numbers, increasing numbers of people being hospitalised and sadly also increasing fatalities. Today we have seen a further 20 Victorians being hospitalised, and sadly a further three lives lost. I want to express my condolences to each of those families as well. ... an extra layer of protection, but it doesn’t mean that any of us can be any less vigilant when it comes to all those common sense things – washing your hands, cough etiquette, keeping your distance, and only going out for the things you need when you need them – and seeing those rules as a guide, not an invitation to go and do things that you really don’t need to do.Andrews reminds people that even if they are wearing masks, other restrictions still apply, and people should only really leave the house for the four permitted reasons – and even then, when they only really need to:I just want to make a point about the fact that whilst a mask or a face covering will be of benefit, it doesn’t mean that we can be shaking hands again. It doesn’t mean that we can be closer than 1.5m apart. It doesn’t mean hand hygiene is any less important. It certainly doesn’t mean that you can head out of your home for a fifth or a sixth or seventh reason.More on mask requirements for teachers: The rule won’t operate for teachers as such because obviously communicating, being able – as the chief health officer has made the point a number of times – being able to see the teacher’s case is very important in terms of that education process where a teacher can wear a mask. More on the face mask order, which will apply in schools, from that press release: There will be some reasons not to wear a face covering. For example, those who have a medical reason, kids under 12 years of age, those who have a professional reason or if it’s just not practical, like when running – however you will still be expected to carry your face covering at all times to wear when you can. In our schools, that’ll mean teachers don’t have to wear a face covering while teaching – but students attending for VCE, VCAL or for onsite supervision will, while everyone will be expected to wear one on the way to and from school. Otherwise, if you’re leaving your home for one of the four reasons, you need to cover your face. The Government will work with Victorian industry and unions to provide advice to workplaces in the coming days.Andrews reminds people that Covid-19 is dangerous even if you don’t have underlying conditions, and that even if it is not fatal, it can have lasting effects on your health:We’ll get to the other side of this second wave quicker and we will prevent more tragedy and, again, I wanted to emphasise that point - the growing international evidence about the fact that this is as much a conic condition as it is a virus that you get and then shed and then return to full health, that is not necessarily the case for many, many people across all age ranges, across all health status prior to becoming infected. This is not a good thing to get even if you are otherwise healthy. It is relevant to all of us whether we have underlying health conditions, regardless of our age and circumstances, our postcode, regardless of any of those factors, this is not something that anybody wants to get because it can present and be particularly nasty, even if you were to - even if you weren’t to finish up in hospital and have that intensive care, it is just not something that we want to see spread any further than it has already been.On how those masks will be distributed, Andrews says:I’ll give you one example - I think GP surgeries will be an obvious place where we can particularly for older people who may have difficulty in finding a mask or being able to go out shopping for one or even make one.The further details on that will be provided a little bit later in the week. The first of those items don’t arrive until about midweek. But we’ll have more to say about that indue course. He also adds, “We’re going to be wearing masks in Victoria and potentially in other parts of the country for a very long time”:This is on the advice of the chief health officer that it’s a relatively simple thing but it’s also about embedding behaviour which I think is just as important on the other side of this second wave as it is in bringing these case numbers down. We’re going to be wearing masks in Victoria and potentially in other parts of the country for a very long time.Speaking at a press conference, in Victoria, Australia, state premier Daniel Andrews says of the mandatory mask order: If you are out of your home for one of the four permitted reasons, then you need to be wearing a mask and I stress - or a face coverings. I need not be a hospital-grade mask, it’d not be one of the handmade masks like I was wearing when I came in today. It can be a scarf, it can be a home-made mask. As you know, we have the best part of 2.5, 3 million of these masks on order. The first really significant - the first significant batch of those will arrive this week around 300,000, perhaps a little more than that, and we will have more to say about how we’re going to distribute those, the different methods we’ll use and who’ll be eligible to receive those as quickly as possible. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has announced that face masks will be mandatory for residents in metropolitan Melbourne and Mitchell Shire.The rule will be enforced with fines of AU$200 and will come into place after 11.59pm on Wednesday this week.People living in metropolitan Melbourne and Mitchell Shire and will now be required to wear a face covering when leaving home for one of the four reasons, following a concerning increase in coronavirus cases in recent days.Based on the latest advice from the Chief Health Officer, we’re urging Victorians: just as you remember to take your keys when you leave the house, you need to remember to take something to cover your face – to help keep you and our community safe.To give people time to purchase or make a face covering, this new rule won’t be enforced until after 11.59pm on Wednesday 22 July – but for those who can, please start wearing yours immediately.The fine for not wearing a face covering will be $200.Those new cases are high, but lower than the record 428 posted on Friday. In Victoria, Australia, three more people have died overnight, two men in their nineties and a woman in her nineties, says Premier Daniel Andrews. That brings the total fatalities in the state to 38. Victoria has reported 363 new coronavirus cases since yesterday. In Australia, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews is giving an update on the coronavirus outbreak now. In Australia, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews will be giving a press conference shortly, where he is expected to announce that face masks will be mandatory for residents of metropolitan Melbourne and Mitchell Shire. Politicians will always try to sugarcoat bad news, but it takes some front to do it on the day that a record number of Australians were found to be unemployed and when Australian workers remain in the deepest recession since the Great Depression.He of course wanted to focus on the increase in jobs. Morrison told Karl Stefanovic on Friday: “We had 210,000 jobs that came back into the economy in June. That’s the biggest increase in jobs we’ve ever seen in a month.”That is true, but when we dig into those numbers we find not a great deal of fighting back.While total employment grew, full-time employment actually fell 38,000 – off the back of the two biggest drops in full-time employment ever recorded. All up there are 375,900 fewer people working full-time now than there were in March.And there are 660,700 fewer people working at all.But yes, a recovery has to start somewhere.In Australia, a large Maronite church in Sydney’s north-west has been closed for cleaning after the discovery of a Covid-19 case there.The church member attended Our Lady of Lebanon cathedral in Harris Park in Sydney’s north-west on Wednesday at 5.30pm, Thursday at 6pm and Friday at 1.30pm and 6pm. The church has been closed until Tuesday.“It is not believed at this stage that the parishioner has contracted Covid-19 at the Parish,” the church said in a post on social media.Among the countries that reported the highest one-day case increases as part of that startling record global rise reported by the WHO is South Africa, which now ranks fifth in the world for confirmed coronavirus cases caseload as the African continent faces the pandemics first wave head-on, AP reports. South Africa on Saturday reported 13,285 new confirmed cases for a total of 350,879. That puts the country ahead of Peru and makes up roughly half the cases in Africa. The only four countries with more confirmed cases the US, Brazil, India, and Russia all have far more people than South Africa’s 57 million.The virus arrived on the continent a little later than elsewhere, giving officials more time to prepare, but Africa has fewer health care resources than any other region and South Africas public hospitals struggle to handle the growing number of patients.Gauteng province, home to Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria, is now Africa’s epicentre for the virus. It has one-quarter of the country’s population and many of the poor are crowded in township areas with inadequate access to clean water and sanitation.South Africa has seen 4,948 reported virus deaths, but the South African Medical Research Council in its most recent report shows the country had 10,944 excess deaths between 6 May and 7 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8a778ba9549fc89da2ce306fabfd381d5fcfa42/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d2b4c30d7bdcd326b792f993bb58874","title":"coronavirus vaccine tracker how close are we to a vaccine","story":"More than 140 teams of researchers are racing to develop a safe and effective coronavirus vaccineResearchers around the world are racing to develop a vaccine against Covid-19, with more than 140 candidate vaccines now tracked by the World Health Organization (WHO).Vaccines normally require years of testing and additional time to produce at scale, but scientists are hoping to develop a coronavirus vaccine within 12 to 18 months.Vaccines mimic the virus – or part of the virus – they protect against, stimulating the immune system to develop antibodies.

In phase 1 of clinical testing, the vaccine is given to a small group of people to determine whether it is safe and to learn more about the immune response it provokes. In phase 2, the vaccine is given to hundreds of people so scientists can learn more about its safety and correct dosage.

Illustration: Michael Viney Of the many surreal images in the iconography of lockdown, for me the most telling was the trotting fox on a shuttered, empty Grafton Street. There was something post-apocalyptic in the glimpse of this foraging, purposeful creature as the only sign of life.For many Dubliners, no doubt, the news video was no great surprise. “Everyone” knows there are foxes in dens in shrubberies near the Dáil. Dozens have had foxes playing on their lawns, chewing the kids’ toys and squatting among the roses. Urban foxes are an old story.Living on a hillside dotted with sheep and lambs, I no longer expect to meet Vulpes vulpes. “On well-run farms”, as Seamus Heaney wrote, “pests have to be kept down.”The last living fox I actually saw was running fast along the strand, closely harassed by a pair of magpies. Otherwise, the continuing local presence of the species lies in the fine tracks stitched along the tideline, pausing at a dead crab or plastic-strangled gannet.The ecological phenomenon of city foxes, however, remains new enough to warrant explanation and much study. As UCC mammalogist Paddy Sleeman put it recently on RTÉ: “Meeting a fox in a city is like meeting a friend in another country. It feels like the iniduals and surroundings don’t match.”How they all moved there and why is simple enough. Canals, railways and riverbanks were corridors to abundant food, from city rats and mice to garbage bags and pigeons. Grey squirrels, too, as Dr Sleeman mentions in their favour.But since foxes are predators, denning in the city’s green lacework of parks, gardens and undeveloped waste ground, their interactions with people, children and pets were bound to bring mixed responses.Dramatised fearOn one hand were fears and the odd incident, with the media ready to dramatise them. On the other were delighted encounters with “nature” and dishes of dog food put out on the lawn. Conflicts are as often between neighbours as from actual fox behaviour.Both the ecology of urban foxes and their relationships with humans have attracted abundant study, notably in the UK. As Stephen Harris has noted, “More papers have been published about foxes living in urban Britain than about those in any other habitat in the world.”Dr Harris, now retired from Bristol University, was a pioneer of research into the urban fox half a century ago, and has served as the animal’s leading scientific defender ever since. In a recent article for British Wildlife magazine, he again worked through the many “widely disseminated myths”.For a start, urban foxes have not grown any bigger or bolder than their rural cousins. With a shortage of the “larger food items” the countryside provides – the odd lamb, rabbit or ground-nesting bird – July finds the urban adults “thin and exhausted” from finding and ferrying food to their cubs.Do they attack pets? Surprisingly few, says Dr Harris. One of his studies in Bristol found they killed 8 per cent a year of pets kept outdoors, everything from poultry and rabbits to gerbils, goldfish and tortoises.Night patrolAs for attacking cats, “Of the thousands of interactions I have seen between foxes and cats, all the aggressive encounters were started by the cats.” On its nightly patrol a fox may encounter hundreds of cats, says Dr Harris. It ignores most of them, avoids the aggressive ones and is known to share a midnight snack with one at the leavings of a dog’s dish.What about human babies? He rejects the idea that foxes ever “attack” them, as sometimes dramatised by Britain’s tabloids. He agrees they can give rare bites, some with serious consequences, but suggests this arises through exploratory mouthing of little hands or legs while “investigating a strange object”. Hunting by sound rather than smell and thus not drawn by milk or dirty nappies, they may be attracted to investigate cots or prams by infant wails of distress.Like other wild mammals, foxes carry diseases and parasites, inviting fears of risk to the health of people or pets. “The latest scare”, as Dr Harris calls it, is the parasite he calls French heartworm, potentially fatal to dogs if left untreated. As I reported here in 2016, the UCD veterinary school was concerned by a sudden trebling in cases of dog “lungworm” (the parasite affects both heart and pulmonary arteries). In a massive sampling of 542 foxes, gathered from every county, it found the nematode in 40 per cent, more than double the rising UK figure.Dogs can pick it up through slugs or snails that have visited both garden fox droppings and dog dishes left outdoors overnight. Dr Harris is duly concerned for them, but points to the pulmonary distress of foxes as well.“Dogs and cats, not foxes,” he asserts, “ dominate the urban ecosystem and we are already seeing the impacts of their diseases on the health and welfare of urban foxes.”Dr Paddy Sleeman finds the public health risk intensifying European study. But he favours new approaches to health that consider “the entire ecosystem – people, domestic animals and wild animals all at the same time”."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"One Change: From plastic bottles to paper bags, our huge reliance on throwaway items needs to changeNational Economic and Social Council sets out actions needed for sustainable recoveryAnalysis confirms Covid-19 lockdown translated to short-term emissions reductions"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to start"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Charles McCarthy AuctioneersCharlie McCarthy, an auctioneer who has sold houses, farms and even islands in west Cork for almost half a century, takes the calls on Coom Hill as he looks out on to the Atlantic.The last time the telephone rang so frequently back in his Skibbereen office was amid Cold War hysteria in mainland Europe during the 1970s, when German newspapers argued that west Cork was the safest place to avoid the impact of nuclear conflict.“The Germans and the Dutch came over in their droves. It was to do with the prevailing southwesterly winds,” he says.In recent weeks, the phone has been ringing off the hook again.“The interest is unbelievable. Covid has made a lot of people think. There is a realisation now you can work remotely, hold meetings on Zoom. People are hankering for a better lifestyle, they want to raise their families as well.”Last week, he put up a property online asking €575,000. A City worker in London made an immediate offer of €550,000.“I said you need to come see it. They said: ‘No, we’ve seen it online. We know the area well. We want to get out of London’.”While the recent high-profile sale of nearby Horse Island, for €5.5 million to a mystery overseas buyer who bought without seeing it in person, has drawn “high-end” attention to the area, McCarthy says interest is “way up” in all price brackets.Online searchesThe claim is borne out by an analysis of online house-hunting.Angela Keegan, managing director of property website MyHome.ie, which is owned by The , says searches for houses in west Cork have gone “through the roof” since the easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions – “Up about 9,000 per cent.”The figure is based on relatively small numbers. However, trends nationally show a definite shift by would-be house-buyers, many of whom have been forced to reflect on their way of life since the pandemic.Online searches for properties in Schull in west Cork during June were up 300 times compared with the same month last year. Rosscarbery saw a 4.5 times jump, while searches for Clonakilty and Kinsale were 3.5 times greater.There has been an almost 150 per cent spike in interest in Kerry properties, mainly in Kenmare, Killarney and Tralee, with similar surges for Waterford, driven mostly by a fourfold jump in queries about Dungarvan.In the west, online viewings of properties in Galway city has more than doubled, while counties Mayo – predominantly Westport – and Sligo are recording 160 per cent increases.Outside of Dublin in Leinster, the focus is moving further away from the traditional commuter belt counties of Wicklow, Kildare and Meath. There has been a 200 per cent rise in searches for Louth – mainly Drogheda and Dundalk – with similar increases for Wexford, Westmeath and Kilkenny.While there has been a twofold jump in searches for holiday homes, Keegan says the data – which shows numbers seeking cottages, farmhouses and country houses are all up significantly – suggests people are re-evaluating the way they live.“My gut instinct is that while everybody has been at home for a number of months, perhaps they have decided they can live a little bit differently,” she said.“We are seeing increases in searches in areas you wouldn’t expect. They’re not all first-time buyers when you see where they are looking.“I think people are seeing opportunities to live elsewhere. Working from home for months in a small house with three or four children, you might be thinking well, actually, I can have a better quality of life and still work from home.“People living on the commuter belt, spending three hours a day getting to work and back – they don’t have to do it and they are still producing really, really good work.”The data also suggests people are looking for a bargain.Searches for properties valued at up to €100,000 have risen fivefold, there has been an eightfold jump in those looking for houses priced under €200,000, while interest in properties under €300,000 has tripled.Keegan says that because of limited supply and pent-up demand, a nosee in prices is unlikely over the coming months, but it will be the end of the year before the full impact of the Covid-19 crisis becomes evident.But is it a temporary shift in attitude, or a permanent one?“Whether it will be radical or not remains to be seen, depending on how employers adapt to the new norm, but I think we have a better chance of a cultural shift than we would have had before.”Lorcan Sirr, senior lecturer in housing at Technical University of Dublin, believes a “serendipitous opportunity” has arrived to regenerate rural Ireland.“The Government could capitalise on this now, to revitalise towns and villages,” he says.“It could be levered quite well to attract people into towns and villages. Now there are people willing to do it. It is probably easier to persuade people to move into towns and villages now than it would have been 24 months ago.”The pandemic, says Sirr, has exposed the unsuitability of cramped city apartments without balconies or outdoor spaces, which are forcing people to think about whether they can live better elsewhere.However, the Government must manage a drift to the country into towns and villages, not unsustainable one-off houses, he suggests, adding that the cost of providing extra GPs and schools could be done at relatively little cost.“I don’t think we are going to see a sudden mass exodus of half a million people down to Carrick-on-Shannon or wherever,” he says.“There will always be people who want to live in a city and people who have to live in and around a city.Overseas buyersMeanwhile, four in every 10 of the premium houses now being sold by Savills are going to overseas buyers. James Butler, head of country sales at Savills, said it registered more buyers in June for “prime country properties” than in any month in the previous three years.All of them – apart from one looking to move closer to family – were seeking more space than they already have.While some of the surge is just the backlog from a three-month lockdown, the coronavirus has “focused minds” on where people want to be, said Butler, who believes there is a “Covid factor” in about half of all his enquiries.“People dealing with some pretty big changes to their lifestyle has resulted in them thinking differently about how they live their lives, where they are based. They realise they can get substantially more for their money outside of Dublin.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4308016.1595069054!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barry cowen suggests future cabinet return says ff has come through bigger events","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer minister for agriculture Barry Cowen: ‘I think there is the potential for me to see rectification of this issue’. Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe Fianna Fail’s Barry Cowen has said his party has “come through bigger events” than his sacking as minister for agriculture this week and suggested he may return to the Cabinet in future.The Laois-Offaly TD said he has not spoken with Taoiseach Micheál Martin since he was dismissed on Tuesday, after refusing to make a further statement in the Dáil on the drink-driving ban he received in 2016.Speaking to his local Midlands 103 radio station, Mr Cowen suggested making such a statement could “undermine” or “prejudice” his legal efforts to seek “rectification of this issue”.“Many people believe the punishment I got initially wasn’t enough, I deserved more retribution, and that may well be the case,” he said.“There was a difference of opinion between myself and the Taoiseach as to how these issues would evolve over the coming weeks.“I think there is the potential for me to see rectification of this issue and there are processes I have engaged in that I can’t comment on a whole lot more, only to say there are processes, there is legislation in place that offers citizens opportunities to pursue such rectification.”Mr Cowen said he had an “aspiration to move in that direction” but the Taoiseach “felt otherwise and that’s where we differed and ultimately we couldn’t stay on the same team if that was the case.”The TD reiterated his assertion that the party was “definitely bigger than Micheál Martin” and suggested he could return to a ministerial portfolio at some stage.“I had a good job before I became a minister, I still have a good job after being a minister, and, who knows, I might be (a minister) again,” he said.Asked if he had spoken to Mr Martin since his sacking, he said: “No I haven’t talked to him, but he’s the Taoiseach of the country, it’s his prerogative and you have to abide by the rules and the institutions of the State.”Mr Cowen added: “There will be opportunities in the future I’m sure.”The former minister, who spent just 17 days in the post, admitted a “stupid mistake” and “lapse of judgment” in relation to the drink-driving offence, for which he served a three-month driving ban, but insisted he was “penalised properly and effectively” at the time.His “humiliation and embarrassment” has been added to in recent weeks “in the manner in which I have to address it”, he said.Mr Cowen said he believes he will be justified in pursuing issues over his personal data being compromised and that ultimately it will “paint me in a different light”.“I’m not a victim. It is the consequences of an unfortunate mistake, that I have paid a dear price for,” he said.“There are some outstanding issues, where I have processes by which I have to seek rectification, and I will do that.“But ultimately it is a hard price to pay for such an event. I’ve apologised on many occasions and I will do so again to my constituents and the general public for that lapse of judgment and lack of judgment.”"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Two other teenagers who ate meat from same infected animal being treated with antibioticsAlmost 4cm-long nematode roundworm is thought to have come from raw fishThousands displaced after heavy rains trigger flash floodingMove after Japan\u0026rsquos capital records highest daily cases \u0026ndash 224 \u0026ndash since pandemic beganInfluential sister of Kim Jong-un says meeting makes no sense without reward for PyongyangMayor was reportedly subject of criminal investigation into sexual assault allegationsBilateral military deal driven by Tehran fury at bombs and arson blamed on US and IsraelBeijing calls on Australia to stop interfering following response to China imposing new security law in territoryGlory to Hong Kong, deemed to contain \u0026lsquostrong political messages\u0026rsquo, can no longer be sung or playedMost deaths have come from hardest-hit Kunamoto prefecturePM\u0026rsquos image undamaged as Bharatiya Janata party proves adept at deflecting blameFor three decades the armies of the two most populous countries have been patrolling a disputed border in the HimalayasDozen people missing on southwestern island of Kyushu as government pledges to boost rescue effortsArmy deployed to patrol the NSW and Victoria borders, closed for first time in 100 yearsFlooding and mudslides on Kyushu force hundreds of thousands to evacuate homesGlobal wrap: Subcontinent overtakes Russia, as border between Australian states to closeNew law leaves pro-democracy protesters unsure of where Beijing has redrawn the lineFourteen presumed dead while dozens remain missing in southern part of countryMore than 75,000 evacuated in southern region after landslides and torrential rainZheng Yanxiong will work with police to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrationsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4307986.1595104318!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus france to enforce mandatory wearing of masks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA medical volunteer takes a temperature reading of a woman at a marriage hall, which is temporarily converted into a Covid-19 testing centre, in Mumbai on Friday. Photograph: Punit ParanjpeAFPGetty Images The World Health Organisation (WHO) reported a record increase in global coronavirus cases for the second day in a row on Saturday, with the total rising by 259,848 in 24 hours. The biggest increases reported on Saturday were from the US, Brazil, India and South Africa, according to a daily report. The previous WHO record for new cases was 237,743 on Friday. Deaths rose by 7,360, the biggest one-day increase since May 10th. Deaths have been averaging 4,800 a day in July, up slightly from an average of 4,600 a day in June. The WHO reported 71,484 new cases in the US, 45,403 in Brazil, 34,884 in India and 13,373 in South Africa.More than 14.1 million cases of Covid-19 have now been recorded worldwide, with more than 602,650 deaths from the novel coronavirus, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University.Finance officials from the G20 group of countries on Saturday called for all official bilateral creditors to implement fully a short-term debt freeze for the world’s poorest countries amid the pandemic, but stopped short of extending the initiative into next year. Sources briefed on the G20 meeting on Saturday said there was strong support for extending the standstill beyond the end of 2020, given the severity of the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, but the group’s final communique said only that the issue would be considered in the second half of 2020. It also said nothing about growing calls for cancelling – not just deferring – the debts of some of the poorest countries.The following is a summary of the latest developments on the virus around the world:USAmericans debated mask mandates and the reopening of schools during the coronavirus pandemic on Friday as state and local officials imposed conflicting orders and confirmed cases rose by more than 70,000 across the nation for the second day in a row.The US recorded a total of at least 70,674 new Covid-19 infections on Friday after new cases climbed by a record 77,499 a day earlier, the largest such increase posted by any country since the pandemic started, according to a Reuters tally. US deaths on Friday rose by at least 912, the fourth day in a row that fatalities have exceeded 900 a day.In the state of Georgia, governor Brian Kemp sued Atlanta’s mayor to prevent her from mandating masks.President Donald Trump said that while he supports the use of masks as protection against coronavirus he does not believe that wearing a face covering should be mandatory for the nation. “I want people to have a certain freedom,” Mr Trump said in an interview with Fox News, an excerpt of which was broadcast by the network ahead of its full airing on Sunday. Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease specialist, urged political leaders to “be as forceful as possible in getting your citizenry to wear masks”. Texas and Arkansas reported a record number of deaths on Friday, while Kansas, Ohio, North Dakota and Puerto Rico reported record numbers of infections.Mr Trump has urged a return to normal, stressing the importance of reigniting the economy. The Trump administration and some health experts have also argued that children are better off in classrooms for their development, and also to allow parents to return to work.Florida governor Ron DeSantis said tests administered in his state on Friday that aimed to detect Covid-19 antibodies showed a 16.1 per cent positive rate. “That is a significant jump from where we were a month and a half ago,” Mr DeSantis said on Saturday during a press conference in St Augustine. “So there’s a bigger pool of people who have the antibody.”The US leads with world in terms of infections, with more than 3.7 million cases.Australia Australian prime minister Scott Morrison on Saturday delayed the opening of parliament for several weeks as the new coronavirus continued spreading through the country’s two most populous states.Mr Morrison asked the speaker of the parliament to cancel a two-week session due to start on August 4th, out of concern about the Covid-19 pandemic. Politicians are to meet at the next planned session on August 24th.Victoria state reported 217 new infections after a record 428 new cases on Friday. Neighbouring New South Wales, the most populous state, which has also been struggling to contain a new wave of infections, saw 15 new cases.Victoria forced nearly 5 million people into a partial lockdown for six weeks on July 9th, as expectations of harsher social-distancing restrictions were growing with the virus continuing to spread. Victoria premier Daniel Andrews left open the possibility of further curbs, urging people not to leave their houses except for work, exercise or essential shopping.India India became the third country in the world to record more than 1 million coronavirus cases on Friday. It has been grappling with an average of almost 30,000 new infections each day for the last week. Local governments continue to reimpose focused lockdowns in several parts of the country, only allowing essential food supplies and health services. Brazil One day after Brazil surpassed 2 million coronavirus cases, the WHO said the outbreak has reached a plateau in the country. “The rise in Brazil is no longer exponential,” WHO executive director Michael Ryan said in a press conference on Friday. “There is a plateau, there is an opportunity here now for Brazil to push the disease down, to suppress the transmission of the virus, to take control,” he said, adding that it will take “sustained, concerted action”. The Latin American nation trails only the US in coronavirus infections and deaths globally, with almost 78,000 fatalities. The country’s response to the pandemic – no national guidelines, two health ministers who departed and a leader that has often belittled the disease – has been criticised by health experts and by the WHO itself. EuropeFrance will enforce mask-wearing in enclosed public spaces including banks, shops and indoor markets from July 20th, French health minister Olivier Véran said on Saturday, as part of efforts to curb a resurgence of Covid-19 across the country. The French government has accelerated plans to make it compulsory to wear masks after a series of indicators have suggested the virus could be gaining momentum, especially in areas in western and southern France that had been relatively spared during the height of the outbreak in the country between March and May.The reproduction rate of coronavirus in France’s Brittany region has risen sharply in less than a week. Meanwhile, Catalonia has urged some 4 million people to stay home in response to surging virus cases in the region. Spain overall reported 628 new cases on Friday, its highest daily increase since the beginning of May, with Catalonia and neighbouring Aragon accounting for the bulk of the new clusters. Belgium may be at the start of a second wave of coronavirus infections after reporting a 32 per cent increase in weekly cases, virologists said. Czech authorities tightened restrictions in the northeast of the Czech Republic after a spike in infections.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 529 to 201,372 on Saturday, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Saturday. The country’s reported death toll rose by one to 9,083, the tally showed.Russia said cases there had risen by 0.8 per cent, the lowest daily increase since recording of data on the outbreak began in March. The 6,234 new confirmed infections in the past day bring the country’s total number of confirmed cases to 765,437, according to data from the Russian government’s virus response centre.IranSome 25 million Iranians are estimated to have contracted coronavirus so far and up to 35 million more are at risk of being infected, Iran’s president Hassan Rouhani said in a televised speech on Saturday, citing a health ministry report. Iran has recorded nearly 13,800 deaths and 270,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 since it detected its first case five months ago. Iran has seen the worst outbreak in the Middle East. China In China, the number of confirmed cases in a new Covid-19 outbreak in the far western region of Xinjiang has risen to 17. The country’s total Covid-19 death toll remains at 4,634. Bangladesh In Bangladesh, confirmed cases surpassed 200,000, but experts say the number is much higher as the country lacks adequate labs for testing. Most people in rural areas have stopped wearing masks and are thronging shopping centres ahead of the Islamic festival Eid al-Adha later this month.South KoreaSouth Korea approved an early stage clinical trial of Celltrion Inc’s experimental Covid-19 treatment drug, making it the country’s first such antibody drug to be tested on humans.Japan Tokyo saw a third straight day of more than 200 new cases. New infections totalled 290 on Saturday, public broadcaster NHK said, citing local government sources. That’s close to the record 293 cases reported a day earlier. Officials in Japan have so far resisted reimposing additional restrictions. – , PA, Reuters, BloombergEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4308020.1595106431!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu summit stalls amid heated debate and recriminations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin arrives for an EU summit at the European Council building in Brussels. Photograph: Olivier MatthysPoolAFP via Getty ImagesEU leaders were locked in intense negotiations on Saturday evening in an attempt to save a summit on the terms of a €750 billion pandemic recovery fund from an acrimonious end as the debate over the bloc’s financial future became “heated”. The leaders are split over both the size of a recovery fund and the seven-year EU budget due to start next year. There is also stark ision over the nature of the conditions attached to the emergency Covid-19 funding and the balance between grants and loans on offer to countries hit by the crisis.Latvia’s prime minister, Krišjanis Karinš, tweeted on Saturday: “Today there is a heated debate about the multi-annual budget and the reconstruction fund in order to reach an agreement.”Mr Martin spoke in Brussels as Belgian national authorities prepared to meet to respond to a jump in detected coronavirus cases.The Taoiseach said the talks with fellow national leaders had revealed “a real caution and nervousness around the reopening that’s going on in various countries, the degree to which the virus is simply not going away, the idea that we are going to have to live with Covid-19 for the foreseeable future”.“What impact would that have on the European economy in 12 months’ time?” he asked. “Hence the necessity to get a deal through now.”Saturday saw a second day of negotiations to find a compromise on the plan, after Dutch demands for a veto on how recovery funds are allocated to member states halted progress late on Friday night.Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte claimed on Saturday that the Dutch were trying to rewrite the EU’s rules. “We are stalled, it is proving very complicated, more complicated than expected, there are many discussions on what we are discussing that we are unable to resolve,” Mr Conte said of the summit in a video message on his Facebook page on Saturday evening.Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said the atmosphere between the leaders had been “grumpy” on Friday, but insisted that any recovery funds needed to be tied to requirements for reforms to ensure that economies are in a stronger position to face future shocks.“One of the points that I have of course made is the importance of reforms, and that they really need to happen now to make sure that next time, if for some reason there is a crisis again economically or otherwise, countries are better able to take care of themselves,” Mr Rutte told reporters.CompromiseThe Netherlands has led a group of so-called frugal states in demanding reductions to the size and generosity of the proposed €1.8 billion package, which includes the seven-year EU budget due to come into place from January as well as a €750 billion recovery fund aimed to funnel stimulus money to the states worst hit by the pandemic and its economic impact.But a range of countries from across the continent have appealed for the holdouts to drop their objections to allow for relief money to start flowing quickly to the worst-hit regions and prevent the economic damage from worsening.“There is a group of countries that we call a group of misers, and they call themselves frugal, who want a smaller contribution to the budget, which we call the budget for rebuilding Europe,” Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki told reporters.The president of the European Council Charles Michel put forward a new draft of compromise proposals in a bid to forge agreement on Saturday, The  understands. These include tweaks to the budget, changes to how recovery grants are allocated, and the possibility for countries to object to the granting of recovery funds to fellow member states through an emergency procedure if they have serious concerns.In a sign that agreement may be possible, a Dutch diplomat told The  the governance proposal was “a serious step in the right direction”.Mr Martin said there was a need to “step back from the minutiae” to focus on how to address a recession economists have forecast could be the worst in a century.“We’re saying Europe has to recover because we’re an exporting nation, we want a European-wide recovery because that will help to underpin an Ireland-wide recovery, that’s the stance we’re taking,” the Taoiseach said.“We do get the big picture that Europe does need to do something dramatic and something impactful through a collective approach to raising substantial funds, and allocating them to where it matters.” Additional reporting: Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Government under pressure as initial lifting of restrictions now seen as having been too rapidEndeavour intended to stoke Arab and Muslim pride over rich heritage of discoveryCases confirmed in doctors and nurse with concern virus will move fast through campsHealth officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4308012.1595067870!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus symptom tracker app analysis finds six distinct types of infection","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA King’s College London team found that the six types  correlated with levels of severity of infection, and with the likelihood of a patient needing help with breathing.

Photograph: Michael TeweldeAFP via Getty ImagesUN secretary general António Guterres on Saturday accused world powers of ignoring inequality in global institutions, but said the coronavirus pandemic has created a “generational opportunity” to build a more equal, sustainable world.Delivering the annual lecture for the Nelson Mandela Foundation via internet, Mr Guterres pushed for a so-called New Global Deal to ensure power, wealth and opportunity are shared more broadly and fairly at international level.“The nations that came out on top more than seven decades ago have refused to contemplate the reforms needed to change power relations in international institutions,” Mr Guterres said. “The composition and voting rights in the United Nations Security Council and the boards of the Bretton Woods system are a case in point.“Inequality starts at the top: in global institutions. Addressing inequality must start by reforming them,” he added.The Bretton Woods system includes the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. He said the pandemic has revealed, like an X-ray, “fractures in the fragile skeleton of the societies we have built”.“It is exposing fallacies and falsehoods everywhere: the lie that free markets can deliver healthcare for all the fiction that unpaid care work is not work the delusion that we live in a post-racist world the myth that we are all in the same boat,” said Mr Guterres during the virtual lecture.“Because while we are all floating on the same sea, it’s clear that some are in superyachts while others are clinging to the floating debris,” added Mr Guterres, a former Socialist prime minister of Portugal.Millions infectedThe new coronavirus has infected more than 14 million people and caused nearly 600,000 known deaths worldwide, according to a Reuters tally. The UN has appealed for $10.3 billion to help poor states amid the pandemic, but has received only $1.7 billion.Mr Guterres said rich countries have “failed to deliver the support needed to help the developing world through these dangerous times” and that the pandemic has “brought home the tragic disconnect between self-interest and the common interest, and the huge gaps in governance structures and ethical frameworks”.He said a changing world needs new social protection policies with safety nets, including universal health coverage and the possibility of a universal basic income.Mr Guterres concluded: “Now is the time for global leaders to decide: will we succumb to chaos, ision and inequality? Or will we right the wrongs of the past and move forward together, for the good of all?” “The choice is clear – to seize a new moment for global solidarity or seek to hide in the thickets of a systemic failure that is failing the vast majority of the world’s people and that has brought our planet to a point of ecological disaster.“Now is the time for all world leaders to come out and respond to the secretary general of the United Nations’s call.” – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"cities like watford cannot simply wallpaper complicated past","story":"Watford Council has announced that four of the town’s street names will be renamed in order to “reflect forward thinking”. A Labour councillor, Asif Khan, has stated that names like Rhodes Way, Clive Way, Imperial Way and Colonial Way must go, as must any places or monuments “named after people who were involved in the slave trade, colonisation and oppression”.Even so much as a glance down the list of streets in Watford shows how busy Mr Khan and his colleagues across Britain are going to be in the weeks and months to come as they force through their cultural revolution.The half-millennium long history of the British Empire, between John Cabot landing in Newfoundland in June 1497 and Chris Patten leaving Hong Kong in June 1997, has thrown up thousands of commemorative place-names relating to our colonial past, all of which must be ripped out of our public consciousness if Black Lives Matter is to achieve its ultimate goals.Just taking Watford alone as an example how long will it be once Rhodes and Clive have been “disappeared” by the Council’s Red Guards before they then turn to Milner Close, named after Alfred Milner who was our high commissioner in South Africa at the outbreak of the Boer War, or other streets connected with that imperialist conflict such as Estcourt Road, Pretoria Road, Roberts (no relation, sadly) Road, or Durban Road East?How long before Watford Council obliterates Cecil Street and Salisbury Road, named after Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, who was Queen Victoria’s prime minister when the Empire reached its height, or George V Close, King George’s Avenue and Alexandra Mews, named after a former King-Emperor of India and his mother, a Queen-Empress, because they were “involved in colonisation” and do not reflect “forward thinking”? Can Albert Road North survive, considering who Prince Albert’s wife was?We need to be told how far the philosophers of Watford Council’s Labour group believe “forward thinking” will take them? Will Lord Street go because it’s classist, Cannon Road because it’s militaristic, Raglan Close and Blenheim Close and Alma Place because they refer to the imperialist Crimean War? Or how about Darwin Gardens because it’s, well, neo-Darwinian?And how far will guilt by association be pushed by the Watford Red Guard will Coningsby Drive have to be renamed because it refers to a book written by Benjamin Disraeli, who as the Tory prime minister presided over the Afghan and Zulu Wars and was thus certainly “involved in colonialisation”?Of course the fact that one or more of these place names might not in fact have referred to an imperialist but to someone or something else is completely immaterial to the Marxist front organisation that is Black Lives Matter.Haringey Council has rubbed out the name Rhodes from a school even though it was named after the philanthropist Thomas Rhodes, the great-uncle of the imperialist, but why should they care about historical accuracy or the person who donated the land for the school which today would cost tens of millions? Ideology is all.Fortunately, one brave person has stood up against all this nonsense, and he was one of the people after whom Watford Council wanted to rename one of the four streets. Luther Blissett, who played football for both Watford Football Club and England, and who happens to be black, has rejected the honour because he says he does not believe in “wallpapering over the past”. In that moment of self-abnegation, with only four words, Mr Blissett has spoken more sheer common sense than all the blathering of Mr Khan and his woke fellow-councillors.For of course the past has its negative as well as its positive aspects. The Afghan, Zulu and Boer Wars were not Britain’s finest hour, Alfred Milner once defended Chinese indentured labour, and so on. Yet equally you cannot and should not wallpaper over it, and there were very many more positive than negative aspects of Britain’s interaction with her colonies over those five centuries.Overall the British Empire is something of which we should be proud rather than ashamed, yet even if it wasn’t, placename-changing is not the right way to go about coming to terms with it. Luther Blissett might not be honoured by the naming of a road stolen from someone else, but hopefully he will be somewhere else, and his words ought to be remembered too.If you hate the fact that you live in a street named after a colonialist, or a military victory like Blenheim Close in Watford, of course you have every right to try to change it. But instead of the mere diktat of the “petty tyrants” of the likes of Mr Khan, it ought to be done democratically, by a local referendum of the people who live there, after an open debate. Persuade your neighbours and do it properly, explain to them why the place names they have got used to all their lives, and sometimes their parents’ and grandparents’ too, need to be changed. That is your democratic right.For the rest of us, anyone living in places beyond Watford like Napier Avenue, Magdala Drive, Kitchener Close or Mafeking Street needs now to worry that part of our lives and identities might change without our having any say in the matter.If you drink at the Duke of Wellington pub (my local – he fought in the Mahratta Wars in India), the Horatio Nelson (who failed to denounce the slave trade), let alone the Imperial Arms, it’s probably only a matter of time before its name is changed to something suitably, painfully woke.In the very unlikely event that you are given a say in what your new street or pub name should be, please do vote for the “Luther Blissett”, which, as your local council tries to wallpaper over the past, would have a delicious irony all of its own.Andrew Roberts’s ‘Churchill: Walking with Destiny’ is published by PenguinMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dominic cummings triggers tenfold rise sales book can predict","story":"Dominic Cummings has triggered a tenfold rise in sales of book that claims to help people predict the future, Waterstones has said, after he told Government special advisors to buy it for an away day.In February Mr Cummings, Boris Johnson’ chief advisor, recommended all ministerial aides read ‘Superforecasting’, a 2015 political science book that promises to help readers “see further into the future”, and ‘High Output Management’, a 1983 tome by the Silicon Valley business guru Andrew Grove.Mr Cummings reportedly told the Government’s roster of spin doctors they should be picking their material from his No10-approved reading list  “instead of political pundits who don\u0027t know what they\u0027re talking about”.He then offered to pay for the books for more than 80 staff working in Whitehall, recommending them again last month in advance of an away day to train special advisors to predict the future.A spokeswoman for Waterstones said their online sales of ‘Superforecasting’ had increased tenfold since February, and data from across the UK shows the book has sold 1,258 copies in the four-week period to July 11, compared to 90 copies in the same period last year.Amazon UK has sold out of its own copies of the book, with some sellers on the platform charging up to £65 for it.‘High Output Management’ has sold 1,337 copies in the last month, a year-on-year increase of 730 per cent, data from Nielsen BookScan shows.In a review of ‘Superforecasting’ written in the summer of 2015, Mr Cummings noted that the “cost:benefit ratio of training forecasting is huge”, adding that “early adopters could use Tetlock’s techniques to improve performance”.And in a footnote on his infamous blog, Mr Cummings then noted that the book inspired him to hire people with “very high quantitative skills” to work for Vote Leave in the 2016 referendum campaign.In January, he announced the Government was hiring “data scientists, project managers, policy experts, assorted weirdos”, rather than a team of generalists.“What SW1 needs is not more drivel about ‘identity’ and ‘ersity’ from Oxbridge humanities graduates but more genuine cognitive ersity,” he wrote on his blog.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"do stack great bookshelf debate","story":"By confining everyone indoors, the government has unwittingly opened up a isive new skirmish in the culture war. No, not the opposed forces of lockdown fanatics vs sceptics, or even the Great Mask Debate. I speak of bookshelves.We know more about other people’s reading habits than ever before – or at least the habits they aspire to – thanks to the Covid-imposed TV interviews with pundits and politicians conducted from their homes, usually with a backdrop of impressively-stocked bookshelves. (A Twitter account called “Bookcase Credibility” compiles screenshots of these appearances, passing hilarious and often merciless judgments).How do you arrange your books? My Dad, a forensic organiser with a hint of OCD in his taste for symmetry and order, sorts his alphabetically. This makes books easy to find and democratic in their proximity: EL James can sit proudly alongside Henry, Flaubert and Dick Francis nestle together at last.Prior to lockdown, I had assumed everyone sorted theirs like this, or by genre, time period, or in steepling piles beside the bed, but I’ve been astounded by the sheer numbers colour-coding, sorting by size, and other forms of lunacy. Like the buyers of unsalted butter or orange juice without the bits in, they are incomprehensible a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.In this decluttered age, we should perhaps be grateful that the books haven’t been Marie Kondo’d into oblivion (Kondo, a tidying expert, recommends owning no more than 30). Yet there is an anarchy to colour-coding. It is one thing to assemble a satisfying block of Penguin Classics or Everyman tomes, quite another to shove a travel guide next to Oliver Twist, a graphic novel and a book on rugby, purely on the basis of colour. And how do they ever find anything? Few of us can remember our book covers, unlike the dim-witted Cyril from Porridge (“I read a book once, green it was.”)The suspicion is that growing numbers are subscribing to the semi-philistine notion that “books do furnish a room”, rendering their presence purely aesthetic. One friend has first-hand experience of this, having worked for a high-end bookseller, supplying London’s plutocrats with “books by the yard”. Elsewhere, self-conscious trends have emerged for assembling books on heavily ‘curated’ shelves and posting snaps of them on Instagram (#shelfie).But perhaps I have been too hasty in my condemnation. The writer Robert Colvile boasts bookshelves in a symphony of shades, and defends his system, instigated by his late and much-loved wife, an avid reader, against my gibes on the basis that “we know our books so well.” Arranging by colour, he adds, creates a sense of soothing calm - perfect for reading. Colour-coding works for true bibliophiles, it seems - and those with photographic memories.By far the most jaw-dropping fetish is placing book spines inwards, like the masochists who prefer to do jigsaws picture-downwards. Perhaps it\u0027s time for the genre-sorters to cut the colour-coders a bit of slack.

Donald Trump, who had long sneered at face coverings, was finally, belatedly, sporting one, and in public. And, with that black mask, embossed with the US Presidential seal, Jeremy Howard’s extraordinary mission had helped claim the most important scalp of all.After a week in which the world - with the exception still of large swathes of the US - at last embraced face masks as a vital tool in the fight against the spread of coronavirus, Mr Howard’s almost accidental role in contributing to a shift in world opinion can be revealed as key. His supporters see him truly as the man behind the mask.What did he do? Looking for a topic for a data lecture for his University of San Francisco students, on a whim, he hit upon masks, and their effectiveness in a pandemic like that of Covid-19. He began to follow the data, collating everything he could find on face masks and their effectiveness in a pandemic like that of Covid-19.The results, he says, were overwhelming.The message, stark: use masks, save lives.And now, six months on from the outbreak in Wuhan, China, after half a million deaths globally, Boris Johnson has joined Mr Trump in backing the virtues of face coverings. After a flurry of will-they-won’t-they among senior Tories at the end of last week, masks will be mandatory in shops from July 24 in England, as elsewhere in the UK. France and Ireland announced they too will be joining the mask-wearing sweep incoming from Asia.One scientist called it a watershed moment in the battle against Covid-19, the inevitable acceptance that all tools in the arsenal must be used to prevent a resurgence. Others remain sceptical. “New Zealand did well, and it never went down the mask route,” said one.Mr Howard was delighted when he saw a mask-clad Mr Trump visit the Walter Reed national military medical centre in Washington last Saturday. An Australian born in the UK, Mr Howard said: It was a relief. He\u0027s a super important role model. I felt like the last major obstruction had fallen in the US.”  It all began prosaically enough. He wanted a good topic for a lecture on how to interpret complex data. He had no particular interest in masks, and assumed the evidence would show nothing conclusive. But it was March, and it was timely.Back then, only Asian countries were wearing masks. The US and UK were warning against masks, saying not only that they did not help but also warning public demand would hit already low supply for frontline health workers.But Mr Howard found something astonishing. Every piece of data he found suggested that wearing face masks could help prevent the virus’s spread, particularly in conjunction with other measures, like track and trace.And he put his lecture to his 1,000 students on YouTube. I am always nagging my students, if the data is telling you something, you have to follow it through, he said. So when I realised what the data was saying about masks, I had to follow through.The video, in which he and his wife  - a leading data ethicist - appear, smiling, in similar blue check shirts, went viral, with hundreds of thousands of views. The Washington Post saw it and asked him to write an article on the topic. It was published on March 28 - five days after the UK and parts of the US went into lockdown - and so became the first post in English advocating universal mask wearing.Experts quickly joined his movement. Scientists contacted him asking him to amplify their research, which had been kept off radar or even suppressed while public health bodies like America\u0027s Centers (correct) for Disease Control (CDC) were not recommending the use of masks. Then senators started getting in touch. Then politicians and news organisations from abroad, including the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the Czech president.While he says he had imposter syndrome, he felt he had to get through. There\u0027s a time in every country when you can get them to listen. That time is when lots of people are dying, he said.This week, Mr Howard presented a research paper rounding up the evidence about the efficacy of masks from 156 world-leading scientists to the World Health Organisation. The pre-print version was the most viewed of all time on the website where it was initially published, and insiders at the CDC say it was an important factor in changing their guidance.Now, 95 per cent of the global population lives in countries where the governments and leading health experts agree that masks are effective, according to Mr Howard.  Dr Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter, said: “It is an extremely important contribution from Jeremy Howard. Some of us have been saying this for months, and it feels as though we have been talking to ourselves. Thousands could have been saved. But at least this does feel like a watershed week.”Dr Richard Stutt, post-doctoral research associate at the epidemiology and modelling group at University of Cambridge, said one of the key aspects was the evidence supporting homemade masks. While they don\u0027t stop a wearer inhaling the virus, he said the evidence has shown they are very effective in capturing droplets from infectious people and thus prevent spread when worn across the population.  He added: “Jeremy Howard’s conclusions align well with the key message we wanted to convey from our paper: my mask protects you, your mask protects me.There remain, though, shades of grey in the academic argument. Jonathan Ball, Professor of Virology at Nottingham University is less convinced. He feels that there’s an element that governments have simply been worn down by the noise on masks.Professor Ball said: “I’m not against masks as such, but I am concerned that if they are not used properly, then other issues like personal hygiene slip.“And many of the studies that Jeremy Howard looks at are from the Far East, where they have had good results, but there have been a range of other measures in place, like track and trace and testing.  And New Zealand, which did well, never advocated masks.”Back in the US, where many states are still standing out against recommended widespread use, shades of grey can be hard to find. Take Carrie Hudson, the owner of 33 \u0026amp Melt, a grilled cheese restaurant in Orlando, Florida.Ms Hudson attracted controversy when she said she wouldn’t allow masks inside her outlet. There were angry protests backing her, imploring the city authorities not to shut her down.She told The Sunday : “If certain people choose to wear a mask, good for them. However, don\u0027t come at me if I\u0027m not wearing one. Doesn\u0027t make sense. I\u0027m mean, their masks work, right? Governments and states that are mandating masks? It\u0027s tyranny!”On the other side of the coin, masks were said to have prevented two hairdressers who had unwittingly contracted Covid-19 from passing it on to their 139 customers at Great Clips in Missouri this week. The feat was hailed in a CDC study this week.Masks, in some ways, have also been the battleground in a culture war. Dr Jesse Olszynko-Gryn, a medical historian at the University of Strathclyde, says this is unique to our time. Back in the 1918-19 Spanish Flu pandemic, for example, San Francisco made mask-wearing mandatory, and the public was broadly in support of the move. Britain even bought 500,000 masks to prevent the spread of flu in tube station shelters during the Blitz.  I think masks have become a blank canvas that everyone projects their own ideologies onto, he said. But maybe that will change now that Donald Trump and Boris Johnson have put on masks.Mr Trump muddied the water somewhat on Friday night by saying he would never order all Americans to wear a mask as people should have “a certain freedom”,But for Mr Howard, seeing the US president wear his was a sign he could  step away from his all-encompassing Masks4All campaign and back to a more normal life - still with his mask on, of course. He explained: Now that the world is wearing masks, I\u0027m retiring from mask advocacy.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/10/14/robots-japan-4.jpg","title":"beetles camera backpack film environment","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.The tiny camera weighs less than a playing cardResearchers from the University of Washington have developed tiny backpacks for beetles so they can film their surroundings.Miniature cameras, which stream to a linked smartphone, gives researchers insights into the lives of the creatures.It has a range of 120 meters, a little longer than a football pitch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“We have created a low-power, low-weight, wireless camera system that can capture a first-person view of what’s happening from an actual live insect or create vision for small robots,” said Shyam Gollakota, UW associate professor of Computer Science \u0026amp Engineering and senior author of the study published based on these results.“Vision is so important for communication and for navigation, but it’s extremely challenging to do it at such a small scale. As a result, prior to our work, wireless vision has not been possible for small robots or insects.”The camera weighs about 250 milligrams, which is about one-tenth the weight of a playing card, and was placed on the back of two beetles: a death-feigning beetle and a Pinacate beetle.It transmits images at one to five frames per second and sits on a mechanical arm that can rotate 60 degrees.Using this mechanism, researchers can get a high-resolution, panoramic shot of the beetle’s environment.The challenging in developing the cameras was not image quality or weight, but battery life.Smartphone cameras, while small, require batteries too big to be carried around by insects. As such, the researchers had to use a tiny, low-power black and white camera which moves when a high voltage is applied to it.During social distancing could these Japanese robots be the answer?They turn their heads to steer where they want to see with extra clarity, such as for chasing prey or a mate. This saves power over having high resolution over their entire visual field.”The benefit of using this method is that the researchers can track an object without having to expend excess energy moving the whole robot.The camera system was also used to design what the University of Washington say is the “world’s smallest terrestrial, power-autonomous robot with wireless vision”.It uses vibrations to move, and uses as much power as a Bluetooth radio. It can move at a rate of two to three centimetres per second – apparently faster than any other tiny robot which uses vibrations to move - and has a battery life of 90 minutes.These cameras could be used to explore previously-unreachable environments and, in the future, could potentially be solar-powered.“This is the first time that we’ve had a first-person view from the back of a beetle while it’s walking around. There are so many questions you could explore, such as how does the beetle respond to different stimuli that it sees in the environment?” Vikram Iyer, a electrical and computer engineering doctoral student who also authored the research, said.“Also, insects can traverse rocky environments, which is really challenging for robots to do at this scale. So this system can also help us out by letting us see or collect samples from hard-to-navigate spaces.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It currently stands at around 5.5-times greater.The disparity between England and Scotland\u0027s infection rates was highlighted in a recent report by the Independent Sage group, which attributed it to the differing containment strategies of each nation.In Scotland we\u0027ve seen such a clear strategy, clearly articulated, elimination is the aim and all objectives are geared towards driving things as low as possible, Professor Stephen Reicher told a briefing last week.In England, the UK government hasn\u0027t been clear about the strategy, we don\u0027t see any particular strategy, some people talk about herd immunity by default, but nothing has been articulated at all.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Take a walk at Virginia WaterSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis spectacular destination is only part of a vast, aristocratic pleasure ground of woodlands, parks and meadows that would take weeks to fully explore on foot.The 4.5-mile circuit of the lake takes you past an eclectic mix of attractions, including an ornamental cascade waterfall, Roman ruins brought from Libya and an authentic 100ft-high totem pole gifted by British Columbia.With so much space, there is plenty of room for a secluded picnic too.See windsorgreatpark for more information.2. Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingChef Tom Kerridge on reopening his Michelin-starred pub safelyAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park. It’s a 10 to 20-minute ride from there to the track. See explore-essex for details.Meet the kayaking instructor...Having been cooped up during lockdown, it’s safe to say that large numbers are wanting to experience the great outdoors like never before now businesses are reopening.“We\u0027ve been ridiculously busy,” says Adrian Fall, below, owner of Brighton-based The Kayak Coach. “People have been so excited about being on the water.”Fall\u0027s passion is teaching people how to kayak, canoe and paddleboard – then leading them on trips up Sussex\u0027s beautiful estuaries and rivers.He set up The Kayak Coach almost 12 years ago and has just taken on two extra staff to add to the three he already employs teaching and guiding on the water: “I love being outside and now\u0027s the time to meet people again and introduce them to the sport I love,” he says.Reopening the business required important changes, as per Government guidelines. Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session. Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Leicester may have been the first, but it was never going to be the last. After a recent spike in Covid-19 infections, Blackburn with Darwen has become the second local authority to have taken preventative action and tighten certain restrictions as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. The Lancashire council has not gone as far as its East Midlands counterpart in imposing a lockdown – residents have instead been told to limit the number of people they accept into their homes, and to wear face coverings in all enclosed public spaces – but the leaders and people of this northwestern region know what is waiting around the corner.“We do not want to end up like Leicester,” councillor Paul Marrow tells The Independent. “It’s all about being proactive, which is the approach we’ve taken.” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFor now, the resurgence of the virus in these parts appears small by comparison. Whereas Leicester recorded roughly 155 cases per 100,000 people prior to its lockdown, Blackburn with Darwen has, to date, reported a peak rate of 47 infections per 100,000. But all fires start from a single spark – and authorities here are doing what they can to put out the growing flames.Focus has turned to the danger of household transmission across Blackburn and its neighbouring towns. Unlike in Leicester – where officials have struggled to pinpoint the source of the city’s outbreak – local health authorities for Blackburn with Darwen have managed to develop a clear picture of the way in which the disease has spread within the region.“It seems to be household clusters where a person who has been infected may not know it, they may be asymptotic they return home and then pass it on to four or five family members,” Denise Park, chief executive of the local council, said.“We do have a higher than average number of large households – five or more people – so we’ve been looking at that. The most recent data testing shows that the majority of cases are from our south Asian heritage communities.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyAround a third of Blackburn with Darwen’s 148,000 population are from ethnic backgrounds, with a large Pakistani and Indian heritage population, and according to Professor Dominic Harrison, the council’s director of public health, 97 of the 114 cases recorded across the past two weeks derive from these minority groups. To help protect these communities, and prevent the situation from escalating across the region, authorities have tailored their measures accordingly, telling people they can now only accept two visitors into their homes beyond their immediate families.“With it being household transmission, we didn’t think a Leicester-styled lockdown was the right answer,” explains Ms Park. “It’s about being targeted with the action we take.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe response of Prof Harrison and his team has so far been met with positivity and optimism, on account of its specified and proactive nature. “Dominic Harrison has been absolutely on the ball with Covid-19 and he’s doing his job very well, keeping a good eye on the local community,” Gabriel Scally, a member of the Independent Sage board and professor of public health at the University of Bristol, said.“I think the council is handling it extremely well. This is the sort of approach that will work well nationally, because it’s generated by the local community, their representatives and the director of public health – trusted figures that the people can be sure they’re acting in the interest of the towns and the population.”It’s rare praise in these troubling and ided times, when the overwhelming narrative of the Covid-19 pandemic has been one of chaos and confusion. And there’s certainly hope to believe that the strategy adopted by Blackburn with Darwen proves effective.Leaning on the side of caution, authorities have announced that the current measures – which also recommend against hugs and handshakes – will be in place for four weeks before the council considers easing them. In the meantime the region’s caseload is expected to rise due to increased testing, says Ms Park, but after that it’s hoped the numbers will drop again.The story of Leicester’s lockdown – and the lessons to be learntAnd thankfully, access to data has not proved an issue, as was the case with Leicester. Ms Park said that the information provided by the local government to Prof Harrison has contained details on ethnicity, postcodes and ages, ensuring authorities have the means to develop a more comprehensive understanding of what’s going on in and around Blackburn.Additional testing units have been deployed in the local community, allowing more people who are carrying the disease but not displaying symptoms to get easily tested. “Let’s not wait till people have got symptoms,” says Ms Park. “Let’s do asymptomatic testing, do some case finding and then say to people they need to isolate.”Equally, the council has said that footways in the centre of Blackburn will be widened, to further promote social distancing, while some parking bays will be removed to help separate people queueing for takeaways and pubs. Council workers have meanwhile been visiting local religious and community centres to spread the message, and providing advice to smaller shops as to how they can protect their customers.Still, for all the encouraging work of the council, and the sense of “stoicism” that it has drawn from the local population, as Mr Marrow put its, the situation in Blackburn and Darwen has not passed by without the dangerous, racist rhetoric which marked many conversations concerning Leicester and its outbreak.“The danger is people see the data and say it’s one section of society to blame, and that is absolutely not what we’re saying,” councillor Saima Afzal said. “There are are a cocktail of factors at play here.“We are aware there are problems in the south Asian wards but I want to make it clear that they are not less or more likely to follow the rules. That’s not what my experience shows. From what I’ve seen and images I’ve been sent, there are groups gathering from a whole range of backgrounds.” She warned against analysing the statistics inaccurately as “they can be twisted any way you want to portray them”.Against this backdrop of tension, Blackburn with Darwen holds its breath as it takes another step into the unknown. Lessons have clearly been learnt from the Leicester episode, with the Lancashire council well poised to fight the virus, but there’s still a long way to go for the region.Blackburn with Darwen\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.For a town already caught in a slow and painful state of decline, the coronavirus pandemic has brought Blackburn to its knees. Decades of de-industrialisation and growing economic deprivation have left the area struggling to find its purpose – while larger, more prosperous neighbours have reinvented themselves – but the economic damage wrought by Covid-19 could prove to be the final straw.“We’ve been here for 32 long years,” said Maria Elder, the owner of Sudell Sandwiches, a small cafe in the town centre. “Lots of loyal customers over the years. We’d serve students from the college too. We even had a contract with the police to feed the officers when the football was on. That’s all gone, for now at least. We’re barely coping.”The worry for Ms Elder and other independent businesses is what a second lockdown would mean for the town. After a recent surge in cases, Blackburn finds itself walking a dangerous line. The region’s seven-day rate currently stands at 47 infections per 100,000 people and is expected to rise in the coming days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAuthorities have already tightened restrictions this week, urging residents to limit the number of visitors to their homes and to wear face coverings in enclosed public settings, but the plunge back into full lockdown would likely drive many companies to the point of no return.“I think it’d shut us down,” said Ms Elder. “People are extremely scared and worried, because there’s a lot of places that only opened on Monday – beauticians, hairdressers. And it’s still very quiet.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“We’ve been here a long time, we’re an established business, but it has seriously impacted us, it really has. I’ve had to lay off one girl as a result.”Asad Jalil, who has run a dry cleaning shop in the town centre since 1989, said a second lockdown would push his business “over the edge”.“If there’s another lockdown for two or three weeks, it’s going to make it worse. People are already scared. There’s not enough money for going out, buying new stuff, people are making do with what they’ve got. “I can’t see my business returning. I doubt I’ll be here next year. Many of my usual customers are at home, working in their pyjamas. They don’t need to go into the office anymore. They don’t need to get their suits cleaned. I only came back yesterday but I don’t think it’s going to pick up again.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSome businesses never made it to the end of lockdown, laid low by the sudden arrest in economic activity across the country. Although trade has been good for Anna Green and Emily Yates since they reopened their salon earlier this month, they are one of the few to have come through this period of turbulence.“In this building alone, there’s one room empty next door and upstairs there’s six empty,” Ms Green said. “They’ve had to fold. It’s not the most affluent of areas. A lot of people have packed up and gone.”The pandemic has only added to Blackburn’s problems. The local council has seen its spending power decline by nearly one-third since 2010, losing out on tens of millions of pounds, while the region has one of the lowest life-expectancy rates in the country.Some buildings in the town centre have stood empty for 10 years or more. Unwilling to take a risk on Blackburn and its struggling economy, business has been turning elsewhere in the northwest.“Blackburn was a booming town,” said Mr Jalil, the dry cleaner owner. “People used to flock here from all around, but now they don’t even bother. They either go into Bolton or Preston. There’s no footfall in Blackburn anymore.”Deprivation is also a serious and growing issue. Last year, the charity End Child Poverty revealed that half of all children in Blackburn lived in poverty, with this rate up to two-thirds in the ward of Bastwell.Nonetheless, stoicism runs deep in these parts. Residents are aware that everyone has a role to play in getting through the pandemic.Blackburn holds its breath after recent spike in Covid-19 cases“Everyone is putting on face masks, all our customers are taking it on board,” said Marcus Gannon, director of Hobkirk Sewing Machines, which can trace its history in the town back to 1903. “No one has got anything against it. They all appreciate it. And in a way, it gives customers who want to come in here the confidence to do so. People are just getting on with it.”Ms Elder, the cafe owner, echoed these sentiments, saying that “the majority of people are now wearing masks” and abiding by the rules – at least in public. “Everyone is taking it seriously,” she said. “I think the new restrictions are a good thing but we’ll have to see how it goes.”The council has also been working hard with small businesses to ensure they can operate under the current system. “I know some of our officers have been out and helped put the new guidance in place,” said Saima Afzal, a councillor. “Everyone has been really proactive. I think we’ve got a really resilient community in Blackburn so they are carrying on.”“My company has been here for 100 odd years,” said Mr Gannon. “I want it to be here another 100 years. We can’t give in.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Couples fared little better, with 18 per cent reporting their relationship with their partner had suffered since March.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRelations between co-workers deteriorated the most as many UK workplaces adjusted to remote working and video conference calls. One-quarter of people surveyed for the non-peer reviewed observational study said they were getting on worse with colleagues since the start of lockdown.“Our study shows that lockdown measures are having a significant toll on people’s relationships, both with people locked down together and those who have been unable to see each other over the lockdown period, said Dr Daisy Fancourt, a professor of psychobiology and epidemiology at UCL.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyShe added: “This is especially true of people with diagnosed mental health issues and younger adults, as well as those with lower household incomes, key workers, those living along and those living with children, all of whom may be facing greater financial or mental pressures which have been exacerbated during the lockdown period.”Worsening relationships were most common among younger adults. Of the 12 per cent of people who reported the breakdown of a relationship, most were aged under 30 and the fewest were over 60.However, researchers found relationships between neighbours had improved since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly among people aged between 30 and 59.  Cheryl Lloyd, head of education at the Nuffield Foundation, which is funding the ongoing study, said the finding “suggests a resurgence in community spirit” during the pandemic.But she added it was “cause for concern that the survey also show that people who are more vulnerable - those on lower household incomes and those with diagnosed mental health issues - are more likely to report worsening friendships and relationships during lockdown”.Launched the week before the UK entered lockdown on 23 March, the UCL study is the largest into the UK public’s attitudes, health and wellbeing during the coronavirus pandemic.Researchers found complete compliance with lockdown measures continued to fall over the past fortnight, particularly among young adults. But 90 per cent of all adults and 80 per cent of under-30s said they were still complying with most rules.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A teenager has donated more than 3,000 face coverings to The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign to protect volunteers delivering food to the most vulnerable people.Business student James Eid, 19, has given thousands of protective coverings to our appeal partner The Felix Project, which is delivering up to 30 tonnes of food every day to those hit hardest by the pandemic.Mr Eid, who lives in Radlett, was inspired to make face coverings because his grandmother, Anna Ross, 68, has Behcet’s disease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe condition, which causes blood vessel inflammation and has various side effects, also lowers the immune system meaning she is more vulnerable to Covid-19.Mr Eid struggled to obtain low-cost face coverings to protect his grandmother and so, spotting a gap in the market, decided to import specialist production machines and make them himself.How to support our campaignFamilies face ‘summer of hardship’, food charities warnWhat it’s like to volunteer on the frontline during a pandemicUsing money donated by his father, who is joint CEO of food company Signature Flatbreads, the Lancaster University student imported a production line of four machines, naming his new company Signature Masks.The entrepreneur has since opened a factory in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, with production beginning in earnest at the end of the month. To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising.

Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The £120m of taxpayers’ money promised by the government for a “Festival of Brexit” in 2022 should be erted to save long-standing and much-loved arts events whose future is threatened by the coronavirus pandemic, the body representing Britain’s festival sector has said.Reallocating the funds away from the Brexit festival is a key plank of a programme to reinvigorate the creative sector launched today by the Liberal Democrats, whose culture spokesperson, Daisy Cooper, warned of a “cultural catastrophe” unless the government provides more help.Originally proposed by Jacob Rees-Mogg as a celebration of leaving the EU, the event was renamed the Festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland by Theresa May in 2018 and Boris Johnson confirmed in December that it would go ahead in 2022 backed by £120m of taxpayers’ money.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut the director of the British Arts Festivals Association (BAFA), Fiona Goh, said the money would be better spent sustaining the existing network of cultural experiences across the country, most of which have been cancelled this year because of the coronavirus lockdown, with many feared never to return. Alongside major events such as Glastonbury and Reading that attract hundreds of thousands of music lovers, hundreds of smaller celebrations of music, literature, theatre and dance were unable to go ahead.Ms Goh said reallocating the cash would “acknowledge the strength and creativity of the existing nationwide festival infrastructure”, which has the proven ability do “truly extraordinary things in all corners of the country” with the money currently earmarked for an untested event.

The UK’s festivals could do truly extraordinary things in all corners of the country with such a cash boost. Arts festivals are a vital fabric in our cultural ecology they support artists at all stages of their careers, the creation of new work, community cohesion and participation, as well as driving local visitor economies.“Festivals are place-makers, bringing moments of extraordinary cultural experience to villages and towns that might otherwise go without. Now is the time to invest in our communities and those who enrich them.”The acting chief executive of UK Music, Tom Kiehl, said it was vital to ensure that Britain remains open to international talent after Brexit, as venues closed by the pandemic open their doors.“The music industry is worth £5.2bn to the economy and to maintain this it’s crucial we ensure copyright is respected and protected after Brexit,” said Mr Kiehl.“The UK must also remain open to international talent. If we erect barriers at home, we are vulnerable to retaliation that will cause damage to the export potential of musicians and songwriters across the UK.”Festival of Britain\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Local authorities will be able to shut shops and cancel events to control coronavirus outbreaks. Boris Johnson said councils in England would have the enhanced powers from Saturday, after he set out new details for “a significant return to normality” by Christmas.

James Jamieson from the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents local authorities, said he hoped the new powers would make stricter measures across communities less likely. “Locally led responses have proven to be the best way to tackle significant outbreaks, which this framework rightly emphasises,” he said.“Councils know their local communities best and know how to address each unique outbreak.”He added: “Greater powers for councils to take swift and effective action to address local outbreaks will hopefully help avoid the need for more stringent measures to be imposed locally.”Mr Jamieson added the use of enforcement powers “should be an option of last resort” and called for more “granular-level data” to be made available to councils to allow them to be “better able to act in real time to increases in infection rates”.Restrictions in some parts of Leicester are set to be lifted to match the rest of the country from this weekend.

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.7 great summer days out for the familyThe team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Boosting businesses that protect nature but also bring benefits to people and governments is the best way to prove the value of conservation in Africa, two of the continent’s leading economic thinkers have said.  The economic value of every acre of land in countries with some of the world’s fastest growing human populations needs to be proven, they say. Quick wins like logging or farming have so far won out over conserving wildlife habitats.  But nature-based businesses can compete against extractive industries if governments and people grasp their economic as well as ecological benefits, according to Fred Swaniker, a Ghanaian entrepreneur and education pioneer, and Clare Akamanzi, the head of the Rwanda Development Board. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThat will help protect wildlife species, conserve habitats that provide clean air and water, and keep human development distant from animal species that carry deadly diseases, they said.The pair took part in the second in a series of webinars hosted by The Independent as part of its Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, in partnership with international conservation organisation Space for Giants. “Poverty in Africa is often so high we can’t do conservation for conservation’s sake,” Mr Swaniker said. “We need to show people how nature benefits them and how it’s the pathway to the prosperity that they need.” Conservationists warn of poaching pandemic due to coronavirus crisisHis African Leadership University’s campus in Kigali, Rwanda, was dedicated to mentoring a new generation of young Africans aiming to transform conservation into a growth sector. “As an economic sector this is one that has tremendous unfulfilled potential,” Mr Swaniker said. “As we look at developing Africa we can’t just copy the rest of the world, we have to look at what we as Africans have that is unique to the continent. One of the things that we have that is a true competitive advantage is nature, some of the unique bioersity in the world that can therefore really be leveraged for growth.” Rwanda has transformed itself into one of Africa’s fastest-growing and modernising economies. That growth has in huge part been driven by wildlife tourism, Ms Akamanzi said. Tourism and conservation contribute 7 per cent of Rwanda’s GDP and bring in more foreign business than any other sector, she said. Tourism investors had opened the way for other enterprises to follow. Key to that success was strong leadership, transparent laws, and making it easy to do business, Ms Akamanzi added.Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He was 80 years old. Congressman Lewis was a towering figure of the civil rights movement, and later became known as the “conscience of congress” for his decades of service in the House of Representatives.  He one of the Big Six civil rights activists led by the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr, and was front and centre for the movement’s most pivotal moments. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Lewis was one of the original Freedom Riders. He spoke to the massed crowds at the 1963 March on Washington, just before King delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech, during which he promised to “splinter the segregated south into a thousand pieces”. In 1965, he led some 600 protesters in the Bloody Sunday march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, where he was brutally assaulted by police and left with a fractured skull. Images of the violent encounter drew national attention and led to more marches across the state. The Voting Rights Act was passed into law later that year.

Throughout his life, he spoke often of his belief in “good trouble, necessary trouble,” to bring about change, but he was dedicated to non-violence.   Mr Lewis was in the midst of his battle with cancer when the police killing of George Floyd sparked the largest protests for racial justice since the civil rights era. Commenting on the historic demonstrations in June, he told CBS: “You cannot stop the call of history.”“You may use troopers. You may use fire hoses and water, but it cannot be stopped. There cannot be any turning back. We have come too far and made too much progress to stop now and go back,” he said. His influence was felt throughout the generations. When Barack Obama was inaugurated in 2009, becoming America’s first black president, he handed Mr Lewis a photograph signed with the words: “Because of you, John.” The two of them marched hand in hand in Selma on the 50th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday attack.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Years later, when I was elected a US senator, I told him that I stood on his shoulders. When I was elected president of the United States, I hugged him on the inauguration stand before I was sworn in and told him I was only there because of the sacrifices he made. And through all those years, he never stopped providing wisdom and encouragement to me and Michelle and our family. We will miss him dearly,” Mr Obama said in a statement. Mr Lewis, who has served in congress since 1987, announced in December last year that he had been diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer. Doctors detected the disease during a routine medical visit. “I have been in some kind of fight – for freedom, equality, basic human rights – for nearly my entire life,” he said at the time. “I have never faced a fight quite like the one I have now.”His family confirmed his death in a statement released late on Friday evening.  “He was honoured and respected as the conscience of the US congress and an icon of American history, but we knew him as a loving father and brother,” the statement said. “He was a stalwart champion in the ongoing struggle to demand respect for the dignity and worth of every human being.”House speaker Nancy Pelosi called him “one of the greatest heroes of American history.”“All of us were humbled to call congressman Lewis a colleague, and are heartbroken by his passing,” Ms Pelosi said. “May his memory be an inspiration that moves us all to, in the face of injustice, make ‘good trouble, necessary trouble.’”The tributes to Mr Lewis came in from both sides of the aisle. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell described him as “a pioneering civil rights leader who put his life on the line to fight racism, promote equal rights and bring our nation into greater alignment with its founding principles”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Mr Rutte wants the money to be tied to welfare, tax and pension reforms, and to ensure that it will go towards improving and creating infrastructure and green investment.“I’m doing this for the whole of Europe, because it is also in the interest of Spain and Italy that they emerge from this crisis with strength,” Mr Rutte told reporters early on Saturday, referring to the two EU countries most affected by the pandemic.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There will still need to be a discussion on volume, and that’s before we get into the rule of law.”Hungary, backed by its eurosceptic, nationalist ally Poland, has threatened to veto the whole package over a new envisaged mechanism to freeze out countries flouting democratic principles.Under Mr Michel\u0027s new proposals, the portion of grants in the €750bn recovery fund would be reduced to €450bn from €500bn.They also call for an emergency brake on disbursement of funds, to appease states who want conditions attached to grants and would prefer to see those countries worst affected by the coronavirus crisis take loans.The proposals would also increase rebates on the multi-year EU budget for Austria, Denmark and Sweden.“We are not at the end of the negotiation, but this at least provides a basis for negotiation,” a second EU diplomat said.Additional reporting by ReutersShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They share a year-old chihuahua called Luna, which Anne-Sophie is believed to have kept in the split.A source close to the DJ said: “Roman loved Soph and things had been going really well for them. But being in lockdown is tough for any couple and they just weren’t able to make things work, which has been upsetting and tough for them both.“His pals have encouraged him to move on and have got him on Raya, which is packed with attractive and creative women. He’s set up a profile with his best photos and has set the music on his page to the song Gold, by his dad’s band. He’s having fun with it.”Roman’s career has gone from strength to strength in the past year, having finished third in the TV jungle, landed an ITV talk show with his pop star dad and become a regular on Celebrity Gogglebox.But in December he was hoping to start a family and thought Anne-Sophie was the girl he would do it with.He said at the time: “Every time I see a child, I get broody.”Plenty more fish in the sea, Roman.DESPITE not ­seeing each other for four months, The Pussycat Dolls are now closer than ever, according to Carmit Bachar.The singer, who posed in a patterned bikini and floral blue shirt for the cover of Lapalme magazine, said of bandmates Nicole Scherzinger, Kimberly Wyatt, Ashley Roberts and Jessica Sutta that absence really has made the heart grow fonder.Carmit explained: “We’ve been going through similar things. It’s more important than ever now to show that women can support each other and hold each other up.”But there is one person for whom Gemma will always open her purse – her mum Joan.The reality star, left, said: “I like to treat her. I am massively independent and I do like to pay my own way.” Thinking out loud on her BBC Radio  podcast, Gemma mused: “Could we ever get rid of money “I don’t think we could. What would we replace it with “I quite like chocolate buttons, so I’d be happy to replace it.”Might get a bit messy in the summer, Gem.THEY say birds of a feather stick together and it seems models do too – as Cara Delevingne and Kaia Gerber look inseparable at a Black Lives Matter rally.Kaia wrapped her arms around Cara, and strolled with her, as they listened to motivational speakers at the event in Calornia, which was attended by thousands.Despite the nine-year age gap, the pair palled up after meeting on the fashion circuit. Cara, who spent lockdown in the US, joined American Kaia, her model mum Cindy Crawford and dad Randy Gerber in a social bubble when restrictions relaxed last month.This included joining the family for dinner at swanky Malibu restaurant Nobu in June, with Cara having split from her long-term girlfriend, Pretty Little Liars actress Ashley Benson, the previous month.With Kaia quickly becoming the model of the moment, I couldn’t think of a better pal than Cara – named the UK’s highest-earning catwalk queen last year – to help her navigate the industry.I can reveal she is dating rapper Jonathan Kabamba, who she posted this photo of on Instagram yesterday.She captioned it: “My Love, my King. Thank you for all the light, strength and joy you have brought into my le. I feel capable of anything with you by my side.”The pair are believed to have been dating since last year.Jonathan, who hails from the Congo, is the first man she has publicly dated after splitting from rapper HYPO in .Before that she was married to scientist Adam Gouraguine but they split after ten years, just a year after tying the knot.Jonathan headed up a community centre with recording studio in Chad-well Heath, North London, to give kids skills to stay out of gangs. It shut in February after two years.Hopefully he and Emeli last far longer than that.BOYZONE split up for good before the release of their  album and the subsequent tour last year . . . or so they said. But they might already be having second thoughts.Keith Duffy has teamed up with ex-Westle star Brian McFadden to release an album as Boyz-Le, and Brian reckons it’s only a matter of time before Boyzone are back too. He said: “It’s  years since I left Westle so, for me, rejoining won’t happen. But for Boyzone . . . the boys have been together for  years.“Though Keith and I are doing this and Ronan Keating is doing his solo thing,the opportunity comes up for the boys to get together – there is going to be a -year anniversary in a few years – you can never say never.”With  No singles between the two bands, Keith and Brian had plenty of options when picking songs for their Strings Attached album, recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, which is out today.Keith said: “It made it very easy, the fact we had so many No singles to choose from. You Needed Mewas always our first choice, the song we were both excited about.” And they are already writing new material.Keith said: “With lockdown, we’re miles ahead where we were hoping to be for the new album.“Boyz-le has gone from strength to strength. We’ve moved mountains.“We’re pinching ourselves to be given this opportunity again in our ­forties to get on stage.”POP fans would have been in for a shockthey had bumped into this trio in the park.THE Saturdays members Frankie Bridge, Una Healy and Mollie King shared the photo on their catch-up, six years on from their split.I guess their absent bandmates Vanessa White and Rochelle Humes were taking their social- distancing really seriously.MEGAN THEE STALLION is “grateful to be alive” after being shot in the foot at a party at the weekend. The rapper, who collaborated with Beyonce on a remix of her song Savage, said she was taken to hospital by police, where she had an op to remove the bullets after the “traumatic” incident.CONGRATS to Radio  DJ Chris Stark, who has become a dad for a second time. Announcing the news on air yesterday, he said: “I am so happy, I’m so proud and I’m so pleased. Our little baby boy was born and it’s just mad. It’s the best.

The model, who is expecting her first child with Zayn Malik, said: “I’m just taking my time with sharing my pregnancy . . . I’m trying to document it well. Right now, I just want to experience it and don’t want to worry about having to look cute or post.”CLEAN BANDIT have racked up a billion Spoty streams of their  Christmas No Rockabye.

He said: Many office workers understandably will continue to work from home even as Covid- restrictions lt, and whilst this may well be the right decision for them as iniduals, for the national economy the sum of these decisions will have a cost.City-centre shops, restaurants, pubs and cafés build their businesses around catering to weekday office workers.So people working from home means job losses in the retail, hospitality and culture sectors.Worrying statistics from Britains rail services also suggest that employees are happier at home.Train services are operating at just  per cent capacity, with Transport secretary Grant Shapps this morning reminding Brits that space was available on public transport and it was perfectly safe to use.He told the BBC: We are quite close to full capacity but the usage of public transport is way down.We have been very careful to ask people not to flood back too quickly and they have not, and so we are seeing many cases of quite empty, for example, trains.Theres more capacity there, you can now . Anyone, not just key workers, can use public transport.But the lack of commuters has been disastrous for Transport for London - who were forced to ask the government for a £. billion bailout following a plunge in revenue after lockdown.It comes as the Prime Minister pledged that the government would aim to have normal le resume by Christmas.But Boris Johnsons call to see workers get back to the office was challenged by the governments Chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance - who insisted working from home remained a perfectly sensible option for employees.And Professor Chris Whitty echoed Vallances reluctance to see leto normal, telling the Lords Science and Technology Committee yesterday that social distancing was likely to continue for a prolonged period of time.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But most accept we have to leave our homes and get back to the workplace to save the economy.About one in five —  per cent — think it is unsafe toto work and want to continue working from home. A similar number,  per cent, argue it is probably safe to go back.But crucially, a massive  per cent accept it is worth the risk of travelling back to their office to protect their jobs and livelihood.The boost for BoJo’s attempt to reawaken our towns and cities comes in our YouGov poll to mark the first anniversary of his Premiership.It also reveals:Last night senior Tories said Mr Johnson should continue hammering home his back-to-work message to ease the nation’s deep-seated virus fears.Tory ex-minister Sir Mike Penning said: “This poll shows that the penny is beginning to drop about the wider impact of coronavirus.“It’s understandable that people are still concerned about becoming infected, but as we come out of lockdown many are starting to contemplate the economic backlash that is about to hit us.“If we want to keep people in work and protect our vibrant towns and cities, we’ve got to go back to work and get the country moving again.”However, most people think a second wave of coronavirus infections is inevitable, with eight out of ten predicting a sharp rise this autumn.And some MPs fear the Government’s success in persuading Brits to stay at home has made the task of getting them to go back to work even tougher.Half of adults say they will not visit a restaurant next month to take advantage of the Chancellor’s half-price meal deal. And one in four admits that even now they still try to avoid going out shopping.The nation is split over the safety of it, with nearly half saying they will try to avoid going to the shops with or without face coverings.Some  per cent say compulsory masks will make it more likely they will visit a shop — but  per cent say it will make it less likely.Elsewhere, there is also huge support for students to get a refund on their university tuition feesthey have missed lectures or been taught mostly online during lockdown.Nearly half of people —  per cent — think they should get some or all of their money back, compared with  per cent who think not.Tory MP Esther McVey has been campaigning on behalf of students who feel let down.She said: “Where universities have not been able to provide a full teaching experience for students then, of course, they should offer partial refunds. I hope this poll will help to ensure students get the refunds they deserve.”Meanwhile, a growing number fear the long-term impact an extended lockdown will have on their family’s future prospects and long-term health.While most still worry about catching the virus,  per cent now say they are more anxious about the financial consequences that may follow.Alarmingly, three in ten people reveal they have missed medical treatment or diagnostic tests during the -week lockdown.Our poll also reveals that the PM’s personal rating has taken a battering as he fights on two fronts to control the spread of the virus and save jobs.Overall, voters say Mr Johnson has done well to steer the economy through dficult times.He is five points ahead of Labour boss Sir Keir when it comes to who is most trusted with the nation’s finances.But the PM is marked down for his handling of the pandemic, his efforts to bring the country together and, surprisingly, Brexit.More than half the population think preparing for a second wave of coronavirus should be the PM’s top priority in the year ahead.Conservative MP Bob Seely said: “The Prime Minister has done pretty well considering these are incredibly trying and dficult times. To lead a nation when you have nearly died yourself is an astonishing achievement in itself.“It’s been tough, but give him credit. He has bounced back and I think Britain will bounce back, too.”Most people think BoJo should lead his party into the next general election, with  per cent of Tories still believing he is the best bet.But Mr Sunak’s star is rising fast, after only five months in the Cabinet. An overwhelming  per cent of people believe he has done a good job of handling the impact of the pandemic with his furlough and business support schemes.And he is leading the race to succeed Boris by a country mile with  per cent of voters saying he would be their first choice —  points ahead of his nearest rival Dominic Raab.Mr Sunak is even more popular among Tory voters, with  per cent saying he would make the best PM out of all potential runners.While Mr Johnson marks his first anniversary on Friday, millionaire Sir Keir has just chalked up his first  days as Labour chief.Most people think he has done well, shown himself to be a strong leader and looks like a potential PM.But they are almost equally split when askedhe is either interesting or boring — orhe has been clear about what he stands for.The YouGov poll of , adults also found widespread support for the Government’s decision to remove Huawei from Britain’s G network, with  per cent in favour.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Maryanne, , and Tommy Pilling, , who are thought to be the longest married couple with Down syndrome, have been inseparable since they tied the knot in . The lovebirds from Southend-on-Sea celebrated the special occasion with their favourite takeaway on July . Lindi Martin, Maryanne’s full-time carer and sister said she hopes their incredible love story shows that ‘anything is possible with love’. She said: “To the best of our knowledge, theyaposre now the longest living married couple with Downaposs syndrome. “Their love story is like a fairy tale - they are so in love and in awe with one another. “They are in their own little bubble of love. “We always hoped they would last this long and had no reason to believe they wouldn’t as there would have never been a separation because of something emotional but possibly something physical.” Tommy proposed to Maryanne after  months of dating with a toy ring from a vending machine, after asking permission from her mum Linda.  They have spent everyday together since,” added Lindi. The couple feared they would be torn apart when Tommy was diagnosed with Alzheimers in . Lindi says Tommy is slowly forgetting basic tasks such as putting his shoes on or how to use the remote control. On some occasions, he has even forgotten who Maryanne is. She added: “Maryanne doesn’t really understand but she knows there is something wrong with his memory - she dotes on him and is always offering a helping hand. “She washes his hair and we cook together daily - she loves making Tommy a curry. “Sometimes it can be frustrating and upsetting for her as he forgets who she is. “But she is able to forgive him once we explain it is his memory. “They are the perfect example of anything being possible with love meaning couples can overcome any obstacles as long as love is there.” The couple celebrated their milestone anniversary with a garden party on Wednesday. Speaking about her other half, Maryanne said: “He is my best friend and I love him so much. “I love watching films, dancing and going out to parties or bowling with Tommy.  The pair have stolen the hearts of Facebook users as they regularly share updates online.Lindi said: Whilst Maryanne and Tommy might not have the concept of what an achievement it is, to them itaposs just their relationship, to us itaposs just absolutely brilliant.

As he approaches his seventh birthday on Wednesday, George shows he’s just like any other kid when it comes to having fun. From blowing bubbles to building dens, he is full of energy. A snap of him rolling around in the grass in his England shirt, taken by his mum Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, to ­celebrate his sixth birthday shows his allegiance to the beautul game. From the moment his first baby pictures ­appeared with his ­parents and their spaniel Lupo, Prince William and Kate’s eldest has enthralled the world. Dubbed Curious George, he is not shy of the camera, from his first balcony ­appearance at  months when he waved at a Red Arrows flypast, to the moment he pressed his nose to a plane window on an official trip. William once dubbed George “a little bit of a rascal” but there was no sign of his boisterous side as he cuddled up to his sister Charlotte after her birth in .  She quickly mastered the royal wave but big brother George refused to play ball when he visited new arrival Prince Louis after his birth in . And it seems George is clearly boss. When the duchess was asked why he wasn’t on the royal tour of India in , she joked: “He’s too naughty. He would be running all over the place.” Just like any other little boy, then.  Prince Georgeaposs godmother recently revealed the heartwarming gt-giving tradition she does for the young royal each birthday. Julia Samuel borrowed the sweet idea from her pal Princess Diana and has a special surprise in store for Georgeaposs seventh birthday on July .  Ms Samuel, , was a long-time friend of Diana and is godmother to both Prince William and George. She described how she buys aposimpossibleapos toys for the family that William then spends days attempting to put together with cautious assembling.  Ms Samuel said: “I do to George what [Diana] did to us, which is give impossible toys that are really noisy and take a lot of making.  “William then has to spend days putting together. And then put all the machinery together, and it makes awful tooting noises and lights flashing and all of that.” Seeing William putting the toys together with dficult is an endless source of amusement for the family - especially for cheeky George.  Watching William struggle to assemble the toys “makes me laugh, and it makes George laugh”, she added. Ms Samuel made the comments as she appeared on the podcast How to Fail with Elizabeth Day.  Ms Samuel added that George is amazing — Heaposs funny and feisty and cheeky and God she [Diana] would have loved him so much, she said.  That is heartbreaking for all of them. The podcast was released on July , on what would have been Princess Dianaaposs th birthday.    Ms Samuel also said her favorite memory of the royal was her laugh.Therapist Ms Samuel was forced to apologise on TV earlier this year as she promoted a new book on ITVaposs Lorraine. She turned the air blue and said a rude word while speaking about how people can cope while having a bad day. Ms Samuel said: You would go to your friend, aposI’m having a s***e week,” I’m not sleeping, Iaposm furious with so and so I did a terrible show, something, something, somethingapos. And then by the time you’ve had a cup of coffee and you’ve had a hug and you’ve roared with laughter maybe you’ve watched something funny on telly, it lessens. Whereasyou keep that in your system it kind go grows and gets bigger.

The epic mansion is in the grounds of Hertingfordbury Park, Hertfordshire, and has some very distinctive interior. Rooms featuring flamingos, zebras and polar bear waiters are just some interior spotted in the pictures.Estate agent Savills, which has listed the house, said the property consists of a main house and then an annexe, which is where three other bedrooms, the games room and the garage is.The home, called The Walled Manor, is surrounded by green fields and Panshanger Park. Visitors entering the mansion will be met with several large taxidermy animals - including zebras, giraffes and a flamingo. There is also a zebra in the childaposs bedroom complete with a Union Jack rug. In the dining room thereaposs another taxidermy animal - a polar bear dressed as a waiter with a waistcoat, bowtie, hat and a serving tray. The sitting room has three large sofas with a gold theme.There is no better place to enjoy a shaken Martini than the cinema room, complete with its own Aston Martin car replica. The master bedroom has entirely mirrored furniture - including a mirrored four-poster bed. There is also a garage big enough for three cars, with classic cars spotted inside protective bubbles. Hertingfordbury Park is also where Henry VIII and his youngest daughter, Elizabeth I, would go hunting.However the mansion is not to everyoneaposs taste, with users on Mumsnet quick to judge. One said: What a cracker. Starts off reasonably, but by photo four has completely gone off the rails. Another wrote: Oh gosh. Where to start....! Was it the zebra rocking horse that put you off  The dog waiter  Or the mirrored cube bed......  One reader added: That is atrocious. The decoration is actually criminal. Who has a stuffed polar bear as a table. Nuts!

We’re one week away from having to wear masks by law and no one has a clue what the rules are or when, or where, we have to put them on. It’s asNASA said to their astronauts as they were getting into the rocket: “Oh, one more thing. When you get to the moon you’ll need a spacesuit. I think you can pick one up at the chemists. Or maybe WH Smith.” We’re told we must wear them indoors but only in shops, not in offices, because the virus doesn’t go to offices as it can’t get past reception. The Prime Minister said we have to wear one in food shops – then Michael Gove said that doesn’t include sandwich shops. Tomorrow they’ll make it even clearer and say: “But you do have to wear onethere’s tomato in the sandwiches, and you must put it on back to frontit’s coronation chicken.” Every couple of hours a minister tells us the opposite of what his colleague said. So Matt Hancock will assure us the masks only need to be worn in the afternoon, because the virus is lazy and never gets up before midday. Then Michael Gove tells us this is nonsense and the mask is most effectivewe eat it with blended carrot juice. Then Priti Patel says: “We will instruct all shops to play music. When it stops, that’s when you must put the mask over your mouth. The last one to have theirs on gets deported.” This follows them telling us there was no need for a lockdown before introducing a lockdown. The Prime Minister told us you couldn’t catch it from shaking hands with someone who had the virus, which makes you wonder how he thought you COULD catch it. Perhaps he thought it was transmitted by email. Every change has been announced as a delightful muddle. Now the rules on masks would be clearerthey were written by the people who compile instructions for setting up a sound system that was made in Japan. When the full guidelines come out they’ll say: “Placing strap B and B important under mask of top chin virus D towards ratchet screw F tiddlywink to prevent cough-sneeze.” Eventually Boris Johnson will deliver one of his clear and inspiring speeches, with bits of Latin chucked in to make it even easier to understand, that will go: “We must all, ipso facto as it were, wear masks at all times in shops, unless you are in the shop for the purpose of shopping.

Ms Samuel said: “I do to George what [Diana] did to us, which is give impossible toys that are really noisy and take a lot of making. “William then has to spend days putting together. And then put all the machinery together, and it makes awful tooting noises and lights flashing and all of that.” Seeing William putting the toys together with dficult is an endless source of amusement for the family - especially for cheeky George. Watching William struggle to assemble the toys “makes me laugh, and it makes George laugh”, she added.Ms Samuel made the comments as she appeared on the podcast How to Fail with Elizabeth Day.

Six weeks stuck on to the other , I’ve just spent with my darling children in lockdown. This pandemic is testing all parents and styles of parenting. It’s why lots of kids are eating crisps for breakfast and going to bed at pm. Not in my house. I’m doing what I do best – old-fashioned parenting. But these days, talking about ­boundaries and discipline does seem uncool, overly strict and controlling to many modern mums and dads. A top professor at Kent ­University, Frank Furedi, argues that not enforcing boundaries and telling kids off has led to a generation of “infantilised millennials”. He’s released a book, pointing the finger at parents who’ve brought up a bunch of big babies left “kicking against open doors”. Giving them a free rein deprives them of that natural process – fighting against parental rules. That’s the stuff that builds your character and shapes your identity. And it is putting back major ­milestones, he says, like our children moving from home and buying their own house. My kids from birth have had very clear boundaries. They must show me – and others – respect. I never let them run around inside restaurants or on the bus or other places. There is no fussy eating at my table. And I am the mother who did not give in to ­technology, just because “everyone  has one”. I know my kids have looked at other more easygoing families and wished we were more like them. That lestyle looks appealing to little eyes – it did to me when I was young. But now I have a family of my own, I appreciate the ­boundaries my own parents set in place. Some that were culturally or ­religiously imposed on me, I did rebel against. As soon as I moved out, I cut my hair, wore the clothes I wanted, travelled and grew so much in confidence.  I can see my kids will rebel against my rules too – -year-old Zac started pushing the boundaries when he was seven, sneaking out of the house and walking in his PJs to his mate’s who lived a mile away. I told him off, but secretly admired his audacity. I know that some of my family and friends look at my parenting style and feel sorry for my children – I could see them rolling their eyes when I’d say I was taking them on a walking holiday, asI were a cruel mother. But I enjoy walking, I am the parent and I needed a break, so they have no choice.

The Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund led by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman wants to buy an  per cent stake. But the deal has been blighted by the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Turkey in . Lib Dem MP Daisy Cooper said: “The Premier League must stand up and stop this takeover.” SNP culture spokesman John Nicolson added: “Khashoggi’s widow is right when she says this takeover would be a stain on the Premier League.”Last month the World Trade Organisation also ruled Saudi broke piracy laws with the broadcast of Premier League matches. On Thursday, we revealed that Saudi Arabia have risked wrecking their £million buy-out of Newcastle United, as the takeover saga took a bizarre twist. The deal was expected to be given the nod by the Premier League imminently. But the Saudi government on Tuesday banned beIN Sports, who pay the Premier League £m to broadcast games in the Middle East, in a move branded “nonsensical and contrary to international law.”  Sources had expected the final pieces of the takeover jigsaw to fall into place in the coming days. That included beIN Sport being allowed on Saudi screens, and the Premier League permitted to proceed with a legal case against piracy in the state. If the Saudiaposs are allowed to buy Newcastle they will hold a share in the Premier League... whose rights holders and valued partners they have just officially banned.

At an Appeal Court ruling earlier this week it was confirmed that Begum will be allowed to come back to the UK as part of a battle to regain her lost British citizenship. Three senior judges said Begum should be allowed toto try to win back her British citizenship. A member of the security forces holding the -year-old at a north eastern Syrian refugee camp said Shamima is happy to be ing to Britain. The guard said: Shamima has been very happy since she got the news that she will be going home to Britain. She is in a good mood because she will see her family and her country again. She is also very nervous about what will happen to her and how people will look at her there.A camp administrator told  MailOnline Shamima does “nothing all day”.They added: She is just sitting in her tent, eating and sleeping and waiting to go home. Ms Begum was one of three east London schoolgirls who left Britain and travelled to Syria via Turkey to join the terror group in February . She lived under Islamic State rule for more than three years before she was found, nine months pregnant, at the al-Hol refugee camp in Syria in February last year. She told reporters she didnapost regret joining ISIS, but begged to be rescued and brought back to the UK.Then home secretary  Sajid Javid  revoked her British citizenship on national security grounds later that month.Ms Begum, whose three children were fathered by her since-captured ISIS fighter husband and all died. There were fears Thursdayaposs ruling could open the door for other ISIS brides and fighters to make similar attempts toto Britain. It means the Government must find a way to allow Ms Begum to travel to the UK to appear in court in London despite insisting it would offer no assistance to rescue her from Syria. Current plans are reportedly for the former ISIS bride to travel into neighbouring Iraq via a river crossing at Faysh Khabur. From there she will be taken to Erbil, where she will be flown back to Britain. A spokeswoman for the Home Office, now led by Priti Patel, said after Thursdayaposs ruling was announced: This is a very disappointing decision by the court.  We will now apply for permission to appeal this judgment, and to stay its effects pending any onward appeal. The governmentaposs top priority remains maintaining our national security and keeping the public safe. Last September, Ms Patel insisted there is “no way” Ms Begum canto the UK. The Government is bitterly disappointed by the courtaposs ruling in the Shamima Begum case, Downing Street said. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: The Governmentaposs priority is maintaining our national security, and decisions to deprive iniduals of their citizenship are not taken lightly.  We will always ensure the safety and security of the UK and will not allow anything to jeopardise this. Mr Javid tweeted he was deeply concerned by the judgment. He said he respected the court and would limit how much he said about the case, but that there were important principles at stake. Any restrictions of rights and freedoms faced by Ms Begum are a direct consequence of the actions she has taken, in violation of both government guidance and common morality, he said.

Criminal defence expert Tasnime Akunjee insisted that the -year-old has faced harsher criticism in the UK purely ­because she is a woman. Speaking out after judges ruled she should be allowed tofrom Syria, he said: “Gender does play a very, very large role in the public reaction to this situation.” The Home Office is fighting a Court of Appeal ruling on Begum, who was  when she fled home in East London to join IS with two pals in . The jihadi bride is currently in a refugee camp and wants toto the UK to contest a decision to strip her of her citizenship. The Government has said it would not help her do so. Mr Akunjee said Begum had faced far more criticism than her husband, a Dutch jihadist named Yago Riedij. Describing her as “more of a housewe”, the lawyer said: “The reaction to her husband, who was an IS fighter, seems to be a lot less than the reaction to her.I think we’ve seen this commonly in the expression of Islamophobia, where a woman’s attire is the most obvious thing to point out. Boris Johnson has focused on women and some of their attire, likening it to letterboxes or bank robbers.” Last year, Begum claimed the Manchester Arena bombing, which killed  and injured around , was “justied” by airstrikes on IS – and that she was unfazed by seeing a severed head. If the Home Office loses its case, the Government must find a way to get Begum back to London to appear in court. Syrian forces could take her to the Iraq border to meet British officials, then she could be driven two hours to an airport.

Data gathered from Kingaposs College Londonaposs Covid- symptom study app gives fresh insight into who is most likely to be hospitalised. Researchers say their work could have “important implications” for caring and monitoring people who are most vulnerable ahead of any second wave of the disease. They found that most people who require support breathing go to hospital around  days after they develop the first symptoms, the Liverpool Echo reports. And knowing who is most likely to suffer a severe infection as early as day five could help save people’s lives. A continuous cough, fever and loss of smell are recognised as the three main symptoms of the disease. However, scientists said the data also showed a wide range of symptoms associated with Covid- such as headaches, muscle pains, fatigue, diarrhoea, confusion, loss of appetite and shortness of breath. Study author Dr Claire Steves, from Kingaposs College London, said: If you can predict who these people are at day five, you have time to give them support and early interventions such as monitoring blood oxygen and sugar levels, and ensuring they are properly hydrated - simple care that could be given at home, preventing hospitalisations and saving lives.  The six distinct types of Covid- Analysis was made based on the data gathered from around , users in the UK and US, between March and April, who had a confirmed Covid- diagnosis. The results showed six specic clusters of symptoms, which according to the researchers, represented six distinct types of Covid-. These clusters include:Flu-like with no fever - Headache, loss of smell, muscle pains, cough, sore throat, chest pain, no fever Flu-like with fever - Headache, loss of smell, cough, sore throat, hoarseness, fever, loss of appetite Gastrointestinal - Headache, loss of smell, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, sore throat, chest pain, no cough Severe level  fatigue - Headache, loss of smell, cough, fever, hoarseness, chest pain, fatigue Severe level , confusion -  Headache, loss of smell, loss of appetite, cough, fever, hoarseness, sore throat, chest pain, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain Severe level , abdominal and respiratory - Headache, loss of smell, loss of appetite, cough, fever, hoarseness, sore throat, chest pain, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, abdominal pain The researchers said they recently identied skin rash as another key symptom of Covid- but it was not recognised as a symptom during the time when the data was gathered for their analysis - so it is currently unknown how skin rashes map on to these six clusters. The team found that those who were older and frailer, overweight and had underlying conditions such as diabetes or lung disease were more likely to get the severe symptoms. The researchers then developed a model to predict which cluster a patient falls into, and their risk of requiring hospitalisation and breathing support, based purely on age, sex, BMI and pre-existing conditions alone.

After Le star Ricky Gervais, Gavin  Stacey’s Alison Steadman and Strictly’s Craig Revel Horwood are among the famous faces backing a campaign to commemorate the lives of those who have died during lockdown. Labour, the Lib Dems and the Tories have thrown their weight behind the bid launched by the charity Marie Curie UK and backed by the Sunday Mirror. Comedian Ricky, who plays a grief-stricken husband in After Le, said: “Everyone needs time to grieve and heal. “The pandemic has meant thousands of people haven’t been able to say goodbye to loved ones in the way they would have wanted. Many haven’t got to hold their nearest and dearest. To have a day that officially honours those people – in whatever form – would be a wonderful celebration of their lives.” More than , people died in the UK during lockdown – equating to one million people bereaved. From March to June, , were recorded as “excess deaths”, including more than , coronavirus victims. Grieving families were unable to comfort each other, with mourners limited to between  and  people at crematoriums and ­graveyards. Most funeral homes were unable to offer viewings. Marie Curie, which gives support to ­families living with terminal illness, wants the Government to mark the UK’s loss on the first anniversary of lockdown, March , . Chief executive Matthew Reed said it would be“an ­important reminder of our responsibility to our communities”. They have launched a petition to get people to support the idea with the hashtag #UniteInMemory, with almost , people adding their signatures so far. The charity is keen to look at ideas for an “inclusive” act of remembrance. This could range from a service such as the one observed for Remembrance Sunday, or a communal act such as the Thursday night clapping that rang out for NHS workers during lockdown. The charity’s ambassador Alison Steadman lost a relative to Covid-. Alison, , said: “The funeral was delayed and there could only be a small number of people. I worry there will be a tide of emotion from people bereaved and they will carry that throughout their lives.  “After going through the scariest period of our letime, a special day could be something nice to come out of the pandemic, just like the Thursday night NHS claps and all the kind deeds.” Actor Greg Wise, ­comedian Paul Chuckle and commentator Chris Kamara echo her call. Strictly judge Craig Revel Horwood suggested Britain could shut for a day to “pause and remember”.  He said: “When this pandemic passes there’s a risk people will forget about it quickly but it should be remembered and those we lost should also be remembered.” Presenter Paul O’Grady said: “Families saw loved ones get into an ambulance and, for many, that was the last time they saw them. There’s been no real closure for people, they’ve just been left dazed. A day like this would help ease the pain.” Loose Women star Coleen Nolan said it was “important we recognise the sense of grief suffered by so many”. She said: “It would give them some comfort to know the rest of Britain stands in solidarity.”  Ex-EastEnder Debbie Arnold and former Corrie star Sherrie Hewson, who present YouTube hit The ­Wonderbirds, also back it. Sherrie’s brother Brett Hutchinson died at the age of  in April from a brain tumour and she could not see him in his final hours. She said: “I’ll always look back at  as the most horrendous year of my le.  “There should be a big street party. The pain is hard but I’d like to remember him on a joyous occasion.” The campaign also had the backing of major political parties. Labour Deputy Leader Angela Rayner said: “Losing a loved one is always devastating, but losing someone without even being able to say goodbye must be unbearable.  “The Government should back a national day to reflect.” Lib Dem leadership hopeful Layla Moran said people had “experienced devastating losses” and urged the Government to introduce the day. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: “We should include all those who have passed and remember close friends and family whose funerals we were not able to attend.” Families are touched by the campaign.

The latest Treasury figures come amid warnings millions of workers face hardship as lockdown support ends. By the beginning of July almost , had lost their jobs and the independent Office for Business Responsibility predicts unemployment could rise to  per cent – more than three million – by the winter. Unions warn that families are already finding it dficult to make ends meet. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told MPs that two income working households, have suffered an  per cent drop in earnings - £ a week – since February. Reduced working hours and moves to lower paid work in the face of lay-offs are the main reasons. Negotiated wage cuts and employers not meeting their part of furlough payments are other factors, according to the GMB union. Laurence Turner, GMB Policy Officer, said: “The Treasury’s figures confirm working households are really struggling.

But now, after a -year career, the lawyer is focused on DEFENCE in a murder case he claims was a miscarriage of justice. And he aims to clear a woman he believes was wrongly convicted. Dentistry student Harmohinder Sanghera – known as Mindy – was jailed for le in  for the killing of -year-old Sana Ali. Mindy, now , had been in a two-year relationship with Sana’s husband Sair, unaware he was married and expecting a child. The trial heard that when she found out she took a kitchen kne from her home in Solihull, Birmingham, and drove  miles to Sana’s house in Bury, Greater Manchester. It was claimed she attacked the teenager in a bedroom and stabbed her  times – with the fatal blow to her abdomen, killing her unborn baby. But Mindy told the court she only visited Sana to tell her what kind of man he was. She claimed Sana was fine when she left. Despite no forensic evidence linking her to the scene, a jury convicted her by - and she got le with a minimum  years. Mr Afzal studied the case shortly before leaving his role in  – and decided something wasn’t right. In his book The ­Prosecutor he wrote: “This was the last case I would explore in detail. This time I wasn’t looking to prosecute, but to seewe had got it wrong.” Three pieces of evidence made him certain:When Sana was found dead in a pool of blood after the visit the front door was locked from the INSIDE, so nobody could have left without being let out. Mindy was seen on CCTV at a petrol station on her way home, looking relaxed and with no signs of being close to someone who had lost so much blood. Mr Azfal debunks the prosecution claim that Mindy climbed on a cupboard and fled through a tiny kitchen window leaving a footprint on the work surface. And that she wore a paper suit, never found, for the attack.Mr Afzal said he would have expected blood to be all over Mindy’s clothes, on the cupboard or the window, adding: “I’ve prosecuted hundreds of murders and never has anyone taken a forensic suit along, it beggars belief.  “They also said she climbed out of the window, but the footprint was facing the other way.” The defence case at the time was that Sana let Mindy out of the house and someone  had murdered her. But Mr Afzal doesn’t believe that either – and claims Sana killed herself. He points to crime scene analysis that showed she was sat on the edge of her bed bleeding from cuts to her arms. A deep cut to her abdomen indicated that she was sitting and bent over – meaning any attacker would have had to kneel in front of her, or it was self-inflicted. Then there was the phone evidence. Between .pm and .pm Sana received  calls and texts from family members. Mr Afzal writes: “Why would there be so many attempts to contact her unless people genuinely thought she might do something to harm herself, or that harm had been brought to her.” He also highlights evidence from Sana’s sister, who called an ambulance saying: “I think I’ve just found out my sister’s… killed herself… I don’t know.” A pathologist’s report stated some injuries “could have been inflicted by the attacker to mimic self-inflicted injuries”. Mr Afzal said: “I’m surprised a pathologist would say this without also suggesting injuries that looked self-inflicted could look that way because they were. Both sides advanced flawed arguments and, to me, it seems very likely the deceased killed herself.” Mindy’s appeal was dismissed and a referral to the Criminal Cases Review Commission also failed – yet a family campaign to prove her innocence continues with Mr Afzal’s backing. “The more I think about this case the more I think ‘Oh my God.’ The focus was on the suspect and everyone jumped on the same bus,” he said. “I’ve promised to do all I can to help the campaign.”  Mindy’s parents Paul, , and Suki, , want the case urgently re-investigated. Postie Paul said: “We have never doubted Mindy’s innocence. She will never get her lost years in prison back but she can be vindicated.” Paul believes police decided to nail Mindy as soon as she contacted them to say she had visited Sana to warn her over Sair. She was arrested and questioned  times in four days before being charged. He said: “As soon as Mindy came forward, the police narrative was she must have been the killer. But all the evidence was circumstantial. There was no blood found on her or in her car. They said she crawled through a small window but there wasn’t a scratch on her.  “We think the police didn’t bother to investigate any other possibilities once they had Mindy in custody. “They never looked at suicide, despite evidence pointing that way. To us, it was a dereliction of duty.” Mindy is in HMP Foston Hall in Derbyshire, due for parole next year. But her family say she will not stop fighting to prove her innocence. Suki said: “She is humble and respectful and wants justice. It’s been a traumatic experience for  years. “We trusted the justice system but it’s failed us.” Ex-detective Mark Williams-Thomas has probed the case in his podcast The Detective. He too says he has “serious concerns” about the conviction.  “I’ve found compelling evidence Sana killed herself,” he said. “The prosecution case was Mindy climbed through a window with a gap of ft, managing to leave no forensic trace. It’s clear the defence totally failed to identy the issues with the police theory.” Solicitors are now reassessing the case for the family. Paul added: “We are so grateful to Nazir and Mark. We need other experts to offer a hand. “We want people to listen to the podcast and make their own minds up. But we know our daughter isn’t a killer.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman finds names seven men","story":"NewsWoman finds names of seven men tattooed on her leg after boozy night in MagalufMegan Gerrard, , from Warrington in Cheshire, travelled to Magaluf with six of her friends for a girls trip when they met a group of lads from NewcastleShareCommentsByMirror:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsMegan Gerrard, , got the tattoo after meeting a group of lads on holiday \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Megan Gerrard, , was on a girls trip to the Spanish island with six friends in July  where they met seven guys from Newcastle. Megan, from Warrington in Cheshire, said they ended up going out partying every night with the boys. On their last night in Magaluf, the new friends headed to the strip for one last night out when they passed a tattoo parlour. Megan jokingly suggested she would get everyone’s initials tattooed on her thigh as a tribute to their chance encounter. The guys dared her to do it and she decided to take up the challenge despite her friends warning her it would be a bad idea. Megan, who works in customer service, said: “I was on holiday with six of my friends and we met a group of seven boys from Newcastle.“We got close with the boys and went out with them every night! It came to their last night and obviously we were all sad that they were leaving. “On our way to the strip we passed a tattoo shop and as a joke, I said I will get everyone’s initials tattooed on me and the boys dared me to.“My friends were begging me not to but I was determined to get it done.” When Megan ed to England, she realised some of the men had given her fake initials after finding out their real names on social media.Megan and her friends stayed in contact with the guys for around four months until their girlfriends found out – and made the men block off all contact with them. However, Megan has no regrets about what happened and found the whole experience rather hysterical.She has since gotten a new tattoo to cover it up. Megan added: “Some of the boys gave me fake names and we didn’t find out until we got home and they added us on Snapchat.

But that is where all the traditional wedding customs stopped. Because her groom, a convicted killer, was wearing prison garb – and the happy couple tied the knot in a maximum security prison, where he has been sentenced to spend at least  years for murder. Nail technician Monique, , had accepted a proposal from Arthur “Art” McCall – a former gang member who blasted a man to death  years ago. Despite vowing to have and to hold each other at their wedding in February, they have never been able to consummate the marriage. But, in an exclusive interview with the Sunday People, mum-of-two Monique insists she has found her Mr Right. She said: “I knew it wasn’t the most typical route to love, but the prison walls don’t stop our relationship from flourishing. Strangers may think I’m crazy, but our bond is unbreakable. The people who know me can see that. “My kids even come and visit him in prison. “Art’s crimes when he was younger don’t reflect the man he is today.” Monique was introduced to her husband-to-be in February . By then he had already served ten years at Kern Valley State Prison, in Delano, Calornia. The killer was talking on the phone to a friend Monique worked with at the Polish House nail salon, in her hometown, Sacramento. The pal, Shaundra McCall, , was the lag’s half-sister.  Monique recalled: “Arthur had asked to speak to me after hearing my voice in the background. “I picked up the mobile out of curiosity. He said hello and I greeted him back. It was very brief as I had no interest in talking to him at first. I knew he was a convict, but I didn’t know too much about his crimes. “I was there when Arthur called his sister again four days later and he asked to speak to me – only this time he was askinghe could call and write. “At first I turned him down. But he didn’t give up. In fact he asked Shaundra for my address. When I agreed, he sent me a dozen red roses. “My partner was still living with me at the time, but we had both emotionally moved on so he was not bothered.” Monique said: “After that we spoke several times a day on the phone. We’re both Christians who take our faith very seriously. And Art loves his family members as much as I do.” She insists she is not phased by McCall’s crimes – and has not even looked them up online.  But he has opened up to her about what happened. McCall murdered unemployed Jonah Simms, , by shooting him twice outside a block of flats in Sacramento in November . At the time he was a member of the Oak Blood Parks gang. His victim was in rival gang Nogales Gangster Crips. A witness identied McCall from a line-up and he was convicted in January . He got two sentences of -years-to-le – one for first-degree-murder, the other for using a firearm. He got another ten years’ jail for committing the crime for gang purposes and for being an active gang member. He finally met Monique face-to-face in June , less than five months after their first phone conversation. She said: “We developed strong feelings for each other through letters and phone calls. He sent me a photo of himself in the fth letter. He looked like this gentle giant. He had the most beautul infectious smile.  “I sent a photo of myself. He said I looked cute. We had a connection and I wanted to see him in person – to embrace that.” It took Monique four hours to travel to the prison. She said: “The security checks were quite intense. I walked through a full body scan and had all of my belongings scanned too. “When I came through I spotted Art in this blue jumpsuit. At first I thought, ‘Wow, he’s massive!’ as I’m ft nothing. “But he was like a lovable bear and had this massive cheesy grin when he saw me approach him. “We were allowed to touch and both of us put our arms for a hug. He grumbled, ‘Hello’ in his deep voice and I instantly melted. We just clicked. “We both had challenging upbringings – his more traumatic than mine – but we could relate.” After that first meeting in jail, Monique wasted no time.  She called him the moment she got home after the four-hour drive back from the jail – and they have been talking ever since. Monique insists her husband is a changed man. She said: “He is no longer the man who committed the crimes. I’ve learned more from him about the shooting, but it doesn’t seem like the man who did that is the man I’ve married. “He’s changed and is only bettering himself by the day. “Our relationship blossomed from strangers, friends, best friends, soul mates to, now, husband and we. Over the months, we opened up to one and other. This was all new to Arthur – having a real woman by his side who really listened, loved and cared about his wellbeing as a man and not a gangster or a felon or a convict.” McCall made his big move a few weeks after their first meeting.  Monique said: “On July  last year he called me in a frantic state and told me to go to his grandmother Grace’s house. She presented me with a beautul gold ring. She had owned it for some time but it wouldn’t fit her anymore. “Art and I had talked about marrying and both felt we wanted that. “Having not been married before, I had his initials tattooed onto my ring finger. I wanted to prove to Art I was serious about marrying him.” After months of waiting, the parole board granted the couple a date for their nuptials – February , . The ceremony was conducted by the jail’s visiting priest. Monique’s son Rodney, , and daughter Malaysia, six, were wedding guests. Monique was determined to wear her gown and veil. She said: “It just felt right, even though it couldn’t be in a church like I had always dreamed of. “We had red heart balloons and I couldn’t have been happier. I walked up a pretend aisle, with my kids on either side of me. Art and I exchanged traditional vows and embraced each other. The kids were happy to see me so excited.” Now the newlyweds hope they will get a chance to live happily ever after. Monique said: “Arthur could be put forward to the parole board in one to four years. “He could be released earlier than initially thought, as he was a youth at  when he was incarcerated.” In the meantime they make the most of their prison marriage. Monique said: “It’s hard not being able to do normal things like going food shopping together, but it’s all we’ve ever known.

The -year-old, who works as a bartender in New Orleans, spends his free time exploring the areas where demolished homes once stood, in the hopes of finding something interesting. And recently, he found just that.In a post on Facebook last month, Mears claimed heaposd dug up a aposwitch bottleapos from the mud at Algiers Point, on the Mississippi River’s West Bank.The bizarre item contained a tooth, strands of human hair, a pincher beetle and possibly some urine. He explained: Located in an area where a home existed in the mid-aposs , such an object may have been used as a protection spell for the property.It also may have been used in voodoo to cast a dferent spell. Anyway, it is a rare, creepy-cool find! He was excited about his discovery - but due to the potentially dark history of the item, people on social media urged him to put it back where he took it from.His post quickly went viral, with more than , people sharing and commenting.One person wrote: Needs to be ed to exact area. I wouldn’t have taken it. Maybe a picture. Another said: All sorts of s**t will come your wayyou intervene with itaposs purpose, best to leave it to continue to do itaposs work and stay out of the way.  A third replied: Dude put it back. I cannot stress to you enough to put it the f**k back. Someone  proclaimed: This year has been bad enough- put it back dude! Put it back!! However not everyone was too worried about the bottle. A dferent user joked: This looks like the bottle Olive Garden Italian dressing comes in.Others thought people were being too superstitious about the whole thing. I have a degree in Theology, posted a sixth person. I can tell you for certain that you need to do whatever the hell you want to with that bottle. What it contains has the same power as a jockstrap. Probably smells the same too. Superstition is the driving force of the ignorant. Another unconcerned user added: Imma say this one time!

We just have one or two that won’t be available for a week or two.“Benji’s been sent for a scan and we believe he’s going to be a few weeks.“We can only guess right now but it’ll be a minimum of a couple of weeks.“As it unfolds we’ll get a better picture.”The -year-old was a key figure as United romped to the Championship title last season, keeping  clean sheets.He will be a huge miss but Mellon is convinced, between Deniz and new kid keeper Jack Newman, the Tangerines can cope without Siegrist for now.Mellon continued: “In an ideal world we’d have them all fit but you have to deal with injuries all the time.“At the minute we just get on with it. If it became a problem for me I’m sure we’d be able to sit down and try to organise something.“I don’t think we’re in that place yet.”As for the rest of the squad, Mellon has been happy with what he has seen from them so far, both in training and against the Steelmen.He added: “We’ve been getting some good work done, getting to know the players better and they’re getting to know me.“Of course you can watch them on video but building that relationship between you is important and we’re getting there now.“The group is really responsive and we’re in a good place.“I think the important thing was everybody got match time and we came out of it with no new injuries.“For me to be able to see them on a football pitch rather than in training was good for building that picture in my head of what we’ve got in terms of how we’re going to play.“That was important and I learned more coming away from the game than I knew before.”What has particularly impressed the -year-old is the attitude of the players and the standards they set for themselves.That is giving Mellon cause for optimism with the new top-flight campaign just over two weeks away.He commented: “From the outside looking in I expected it to be like that because they’d had success and you’d imagine the team spirit would be very strong.“That’s not surprised me. They work really hard every day in training and I don’t have to ask them or stop training to up the tempo, they hit it on their own all the time.“That’s a great credit to them and their professionalism. That’s certainly very pleasing to have.“I’m happy at the minute but we’ve still got a lot of work to do moving forward in achieving our aim of winning games of football.“We’re in a work in progress but we’re moving forward.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

In terms of pure squad size, though, cover is needed.We’ve already seen with Siegrist, Butcher and Shankland struggling with injury how short the Terrors could be in crucial early games.A couple of extra bodies would alleviate any concerns of stling.That all but one of their under-contract first-team players accepted a wage cut is cause for optimism for Dundee.The vast majority of the squad making a salary sacrice is testament not only to the players as iniduals but to the togetherness of the club as well.It should reassure Dark Blues supporters they’ll be just fine on the pitch next season under James McPake.He’s clearly built a solid team spirit and bond – one strong enough to see them through the trials and tribulations on and off the park in the months ahead.However, the fact Kane Hemmings is the exception to the rule and could, potentially, be out the door at Dens Park is the last thing the Dee would’ve wanted.Minus the English striker, Dundee are a dferent animal. He, after all, was their marquee signing last summer.The hitman is more than just a goal-scorer, he’s their talisman. Iniably,the -year-old performs well then so do his team.Finding a replacement of his quality would be some task but Dee fans should be hoping all is not lost on No  sticking around.As a proud Scotsman it pains me to say it but Harry Kane truly is a magnicent goal-scorer.He has done it consistently for seasons now butthere was ever any doubt about his ability he has well and truly quashed that by netting his th club career goal against Newcastle on Wednesday.At just ,he stays fit, you wouldn’t bet against him topping Alan Shearer’s Premier League record and Wayne Rooney’s England total.That the Premiership is due toin two weeks and we still have arguments raging between the SFA, SPFL and its member clubs is, sadly, no surprise.Surely this should have been sorted amicably by now PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – Does Kane Hemmings have a future at Dundee and will Benjamin Siegrist be fit for United’s opener \" title\"#PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – Does Kane Hemmings have a future at Dundee and will Benjamin Siegrist be fit for United’s opener # # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street- embed # secretJqBekuS\" data-secret\"JqBekuS\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

Guidelines remain to avoid touching surfaces or opening gates where possible, to follow signs and avoid coming into contact with farm workers where applicable, and to keep dogs on leads and avoid areas known to be busy. Pubs and restaurants without door space have also been allowed to reopen.

Each oyster can filtrate and clean up to  litres of water a day, and the native oyster reefs enhance bioersity by becoming fish spawning grounds and nurseries.Back in March Seawilding secured a National Lottery Heritage Fund grant to grow young native oysters over a five-year period in floating baskets on the loch. When they are semi-mature, the oysters will be moved to trial seabed sites around Loch Craignish, where it is hoped they will become a self-sustaining population.Project co-ordinator Danny Renton told the Advertiser: #This is a pioneering project, driven by the Craignish community. Loch Craignish was once a rich environment for native oysters and scallops in particular, but bottom trawling since the s has destroyed much of the seabed. Our community wants to reverse that. We hear a lot about rewilding, but there’s little action been taken so far with restoration of marine habitats – so what we are doing at Loch Craignish is an exciting opportunity to show that marine rewilding and reintroduction of priority marine species is possible.#The project is teaming up with Scottish Association of Marine Scienceand the Department of Aquaculture from Stirling University to enable  marine science students to monitor, survey and research the restoration efforts over the next five years.To kick off the project, the charity along with local partner Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and the Ardfern Yacht Centre, has been introducing native oysters in suspended cages under the pontoons of the yacht centre.Each Oyster Hoister houses  mature oysters which will help clean up the marina water as well as releasing spat, adding to the wider restoration effort in the loch. The hoisters are sponsored by members of the community and boat owners, and the plan is to suspend around  cages by the end of the year.When schools open in August, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation will be working with pupils to monitor the oysters in the cages, measuring their growth and recording bioersity.Oly Hemmings and Pete Creech, the organisation’s rangers, initially want pupils from five local primary schools to get involved in this exciting project. This is an opportunity for pupils to actively take part in valuable research that will be added to data already being collected from other oyster reintroductions throughout the UK.Oly said: #We’ve been interacting with oysters in Argyll for around , years and it is fantastic to be able to get future generations involved in ensuring this relationship continues.#Any schools interested can email Oly and Pete at info@heartofargyllwildle.org for further information. A teacher’s resource pack that can be used in conjunction with school visits or as a standalone resource is available. The educational objectives are fully funded by the project’s funders, the National Lottery, and this includes travel to and from the project venue at Ardfern Yacht Centre. Oly and Pete also intend to engage with older schoolchildren and community groups as the project progresses.For further information about the Loch Craignish Native Oyster Restoration Project, please visit www.seawilding.org or email info@seawilding.org"},{"url":null,"title":"support local call as argyll eases out of lockdown","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPubs and restaurants have opened, tourist attractions can now be visited # and those wild and woolly lockdown locks can finally be tamed by a visit to the hairdresser.As the easing out of coronavirus lockdown continues in Scotland, this week has seen the most signicant relaxation of restrictions imposed as the coronavirus pandemic arrived in March.Among other steps, places of worship and childcare providers can now all reopen.There is also a partial relaxation of  restrictions on attendance at funerals and marriage ceremonies, while closer working may now be permitted in the building trade.All of the above, of course, comes with strict safety requirements which must be adhered to # but they are steps in the right direction.And with many Argyll business ready to re-open, residents are being encouraged to support Argyll and Bute by buying local.#Post COVID-, we should support our local businesses as they have supported us during the pandemic,# said Councillor Alastair Redman, Argyll and Bute Council#s policy lead for economic growth.#With lockdown in place,# continued Councillor Redman, #our food and drink producers had to change the way they did business – often in imaginative ways.

We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

herself into three weeks intense training for the role, while also coming up with her characters dialect.The Australian star, known for another big Netflix series,  Reasons Why, also worked with a trainer on the weekends when they had finished filming, they called it \"prehab\", to make sure she didnt get injured.Its all part of telling the story of a \"true heroine\", which was something Langford felt was very \"timely\" and was partly what drew her to the script of Cursed, created by Tom Wheeler and Frank Miller.Based on the book of the same name , the -part series is a reimagining of the tale of King Arthur, and explores themes such as the obliteration of the natural world, religious zeal and oppression, senseless war and finding the courage to lead in the face of the impossible.The coming-of-age story is told through the eyes of Nimue, a powerful warrior witch who has a mysterious gt and is the young woman who would become the Lady of the Lake.Following the death of her mother, she finds an unexpected partner in Arthur, a humble mercenary, in a quest to find Merlin and deliver an ancient sword, and also save her people.\"Its interesting, because when you think of the Arthurian legend, you think of Arthur and Merlin and the Knights of the Roundtable but we very seldom e into the female characters,\" notes Perth-born Langford, who has also starred in films Love, Simon and Knives Out.\"Particularly with the Lady of the Lake, whos such an iconic figure within that legend, we know very little to nothing about her.\"So, when I was taking on this role, the first thing I did was to try and research little bits about her.\"American-Australian actor Devon Terrelltakes on the role of Arthur, and agrees playing such a legendary character comes with a lot of pressure.\"I love that kind of pressure because it just means I have to do my research, and I work physically and mentally and emotionally with this character and I can find the truth of who they are,\" says the -year-old star, best known for playing a young Barack Obama in the  biographical film Barry.\"Being a person of colour playing the role is extremely exciting because, growing up, I didnt see myself a lot in fantasy.\"I wanted to be a part of it so much I love Lord Of The Rings, I love Game Of Thrones, I love Harry Potter, and I didnt see a lot of myself represented, especially as a lead character.\"He adds with a smile: \"If you can believe in a magical sword, you should be able to believe that a person of colour should be able to play this character.\"I think its so exciting because this show is going to inspire so many young people, of dferent genders and dferent colour, that are going to say, I am not the other this is what the world looks like.\"What was his first reaction when he read the script \"Actually, I was helping a friend out with an audition and they happened to be auditioning for this, and I told my agent and they got in touch and they said, Oh my God, wed love him to audition,\" he recalls.\"It was an amazingly quick process.\"My first reaction was, I know I can do this, I know I can play this,they take the chance.\"And it just so happened that in their heads they were like, this is the right person for the role.\"Its not, Were making a erse choice.\"The thing I always worry about ersity is, is it a question of, Oh, do we wanna make this a erse show \"I just think, in the times we are living now, it shouldnt be that we pat ourselves on the back for being erse.\"As for the challenges of the role, amiable Terrell confides: \"It was a physical, mental and emotional journey the whole way.\"I think the fear is, Am I predicting for the audience too much  Am I showing too much of a leadership role \"Am I being too weak in this moment  And I think that was always a challenge, balancing him.\"Because in moments, its like, When do I give charge to Nimue, and when is she allowing me to be the leader \"Because this is very much the story of the Lady of the Lake.\"Langford points out how sometimes, \"girls or women are told that its masculine to be strong, which isnt true at all\".Which is why she felt Nimue was an important character to represent on-screen the story recognises \"all the obstacles which are specic to women\" that she has to overcome on her journey, but also shows how she is a \"strong and capable hero\".\"I think the most important thing with this is showing that she is capable, and not undermining her by her falling over for no reason, which sounds kinda crazy when you just say it like that, but sometimes scripts you read,theres a girl and a boy, the girl stumbles and the boy has to help her up,\" chatty Langford elaborates candidly.\"I dont rememberthere were any moments like that within this script, butthere were, I felt really comfortable to go to Tom and just say, Hey, I dont quite understand why she does this  And he would go, Oh yeah, that makes no sense at all, just do what makes sense, which is for her to run, and not fall over anything, do you know what I mean \"Cursed is available on Netflix."},{"url":null,"title":"books-five-new-books-read-lockdown-week","story":".

Despite that countryrsquos reputation for fine Arabicas, the coffee in our hotel was dreadful. Irsquod drink water instead. For three days I experienced strange aches in my lower back and legs. I put it down to the physical confinement on the plane, but in retrospect I think I was experiencing caffeine withdrawal symptoms.Home again, I was back on coffee, although not enjoying it. A few sips seemed to make my heart beat faster it made me feel slightly nauseous.So for around eight years, I stopped drinking coffee totally, and felt all the better for it. I became a tea enthusiast, and underwent a tea education. But only drinking tea was a pain really, because good black tea is hard to find. Despite Britainrsquos reputation as a nation of tea drinkers, most of the stuff we drink is rubbish.And then I was in Rome, visiting the wondrous Pantheon, a stonersquos throw away from Caffegrave SantrsquoEustachio, renowned since  for its espresso. Its aroma hangs in the air around this historic locale. To ask for a camomile tea here would be idiotic. Irsquod be served, politely, a tepid brew made from some fusty box of tea bags, but this is place where anyone cultivating lsquola bella figurarsquo knows not to ask for a latte, or any other wimpy touristrsquos coffee, let alone tea. So I drank the potent espresso. Three sips, it was gone. My pulse didnrsquot race. I slept well that night on a hard hotel mattress. So, my coffee exclusion regime stopped there and then.Reading up on my strange lack of adverse reaction I reviewed ious theories as to why espresso, though stronger tasting than filter or cafegravetiere coffee, wasnrsquot having that lsquowiredrsquo effect on me. One idea is that the steaming process removes more of the caffeine another is that the steam is irrelevant, you just drink less caffeine overall with a small espresso. All I know is that a single shot of well-made espresso causes me no problems.Stealthily, I resumed occasional espresso drinking, always in indie coffee shops, perhaps two or three times weekly. Here was another revelation. Many places in the UK make great espresso, which for me means unapologetically strong, smooth and nutty. In others, itrsquos unpleasant, usually thin and acidic. The worst espresso Irsquove encountered was in a major coffee chain. There was a downpour, I dashed in to be dry. It was undrinkable. Never again. Pick your coffee shop carefully.And then came lockdown. No coffee shops  My lingering taste for espresso, call it addictionyou like, kicked in big time. How would I manage  I have no interest in coffee pod machines. They take up too much of the limited space in my kitchen, the plastic detritus appals me, and many are branded with the N word, the initial for a company I boycott. So prior to house arrest, I dashed to a nearby ironmongers that stocks those stovetop espressopots Italians use at home: one, three, six and nine cup-size, priced pound., pound., pound., pound. respectively.An espresso in a cafe costs between pound and pound. a shot.

This famous watering hole, in the depths of the borders, used to be the haunt of writers like James Hogg and Sir Walter Scott. One broiling summerrsquos day my husband, having trekked what felt like the entire Southern Upland Way, finally reached its doors. Sun-baked and sweaty, he entered the bar like a bedouin falling upon an oasis, and with the last of his strength ordered a pint of beer. The publican ndash dressed like a dentist of old, in a white lab coat ndash wordlessly poured his drink and shoved it towards him. When he began babbling his gratitude, and describing the arduousness of his passage over the hills, she cut him short. ldquoNobody told you to do it, she said.The British tradition of outrageously hostile hospitality stretches back long before Basil Fawlty. It seems some of us donrsquot merely tolerate curmudgeons behind the taps but actively enjoy being insulted. The title of Norman Balonrsquos memoir of his years as a Soho publican ndash Yoursquore Barred, You Bastards ndash sums it up. Balon was celebrated as Londonrsquos grumpiest landlord, treasured for his unaccommodating persona. The Coach and Horses, over which he presided irascibly for -plus years, was the haunt of the writer Jeffrey Barnard. His Low Le column in The Spectator was a droll but tragic depiction of a man whose every waking thought led to the next tipple. When Keith Waterhouse turned the column into the play Jeffrey Barnard is Unwell, he immortalised Balon as well as Barnard. These days, I see that The Coach and Horses claims to be the first London pub to offer vegan meals. For a brief spell it even enjoyed a nudist licence. What Balon would have thought about this development would likely be unprintable.Over the years Irsquove spent more hours in pubs than I care to remember, but while the occasional off-taking quip is amusing, serious rudeness makes me head where. Willie Ross, of the Oxford Bar in Edinburgh, was in a class of his own when it came to abrasiveness. Photos show him presiding over his fiefdom, with a face like a hanging judge and a fag in his mouth. Described as instilling ldquosomething close to a sense of terror in customers, he apparently wouldnrsquot serve the English or women. Food was also verboten. Legend has it that when one hapless customer, a QC, askedhe could see the menu, Ross took him by the arm and led him out into the street. Pointing up at the pubrsquos signboard, he said, ldquoWhere does it say f***ing restaurant .No fan of the Edinburgh Festival and its luvvies, he once put up a sign saying, ldquoClosed due to Festival. When I first visited, however, the Oxford Bar was under new management, and far more inviting. By this time Ian Rankin had placed it on the tourist map as Inspector Rebusrsquos local. The countless sightseers who troop into this literary landmark would have got a taste of an altogether grimmer Scotland had Ross still been in charge.The real-ale pub where I used to live was the ideal establishment. The owner had a wicked sense of humour, and tolerated peculiarities on both sides of the bar. On St Patrickrsquos Day hersquod offer a two-for-three deal on all drinks. Other than crisps and peanuts, food was not available, no matter how hard we pleaded. He did, however, allow taxi drivers to bring in their slow cooker after a morning sht, and ladle out chilli con carne while they played cards. In the early evenings, one bloke would bring in a cheese board, and invite everyone to pile in. A mountaineering bicyclist often arrived smelling of woodsmoke and handed out tinfoil parcels of delicious trout, cured in his garden shed. Another old-timer used to produce leeks from his allotment, which he passed beneath the bar in paper bags, like smugglersrsquo contraband. When one night I was cornered by a man who could bore for an hour without drawing breath, the landlord paraded around the crowded room, waving a white flag to summon a rescue party.In an era where the customer comes first, the days of martinets like Ross or the lady of the loch are numbered. I canrsquot say Irsquom altogether sorry. Yet although a good bartenderrsquos manner is part of what draws people back, they canrsquot be bland or dull. Itrsquos a demanding job, and a touch of authority and steel is essential. People capable of handling humanity at its most outspoken, vocal and occasionally insufferable, are rarely naturersquos sweet sherry. I like to think of those with the saltiest personalities as an acquired flavour, like a peaty Islay malt. Ideally, a publican sits midway between the two: a New Zealand sauvignon, perhaps, or dry GT.Itrsquos a job I certainly couldnrsquot handle, especially in a busy city centre. My husband recalls that our wedding ceremony in a Glasgow registrarrsquos office took less time than ordering a drink in the Horseshoe bar. I remember joining him there one evening, when two women arrived and asked for two white wines. ldquoSmall, medium or large  asked the impeccably polite bartender. ldquoBottles, they replied.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The UK Government will publish legislation on the rules that will govern the UK single market to replace the EU single market, which we leave in six months. This will replicate, in theory, the economic level playing field that used to be overseen by the trade regulators in the European Commission.:Opinion: Ian McConnell: Whether European Research Group chairman Mark Francois sees value of EU is neither here nor there amid this Brexit shamblesNow, in his time as a Brussels correspondent, Boris Johnson made his name by traducing these regulations. He pilloried Brussels bureaucrats trying to ban British prawn cocktail crisps, adjudicating on condom dimensions or the degree of curvature on cucumbers. This was mostly journalistic invention. However, there was an element of truth in his Bonkers Brussels stories.To create a single market you have to have common trading and hygiene standards,only to prevent countries using them as ldquonon-tarf barriers to free trade. So there is poetic justice in Mr Johnson now finding himself in the position of the maligned eurocrats and trying to dictate the self-same rules for Scotland through the ldquopower grab.Perhaps Nicola Sturgeon should dust down some of his riper columns. For Mr Johnson also railed against state aid laws that prevented countries supporting their key industries. Mr Johnson suggested that was just in the interest of German exporters. Now the PM is dictating state aid rules to Scotland ndash essentially that we shouldnrsquot have them.Ms Sturgeon calls this a ldquofull-scale assault on devolution. Nor is she willing to accept ldquomutual recognition of trading and health and safety standards regulations which might expose Scotland to American chlorinated chickens and hormone-fed beef.Rather like the unbent bananas, the chlorinated chickens are a bit of a myth, and unlikely to appear on British shelves. The UK Government negotiators have made that clear to their US counterparts.But the Cabinet Office Secretary, Michael Gove, has also made it clear that a new UK internal market regulatory body will call the shots on state aid. It will also alter regulations on food standards and the like without consent from the Scottish Government. So the chemical fowl do perform the politicalof reminding people that the Scottish Parliament does at present have, at least in theory, a veto power over things like health, environment, animal welfare. This is because these matters were not included in the powers reserved to Westminster under the  Scotland Act.Of course, Holyrood only exercised these powers on behalf of Brussels it did not actually set the trading standards or state aid rules itself. However, it did and does exercise a degree of latitude in applying the standards and allocating state aid.For example, the Scottish Government was able to funnel more than poundmillion to Amazon under Selective Regional Assistance and other grants. These are EU-compliant forms of state aid permitted in order to attract companies to unemployment black spots ndash in this case Dunfermline. Ms Sturgeon might be a little shy of referring to that particular exercise in state aid since it emerged that Amazon was paying less in tax per year than it was receiving in ious forms of UK Government subsidies. It was also paying workers rather less than the Scottish Governmentrsquos Living Wage.But the principle is clear: Scotland has a strong case to retain powers over state aid, and not just because of a narrow interpretation of the devolution legislation.In America, supposedly land of the free market, devolved jurisdictions have state aid policies that would delight Jeremy Corbyn. San Francisco gave tax breaks and subsidies to attract Twitterrsquos HQ that could never have been allowed in Europe. In Delaware you can set up a business and pay no tax at all.No one is suggesting that Scotland should become an international tax haven, of course. But it can make a strong case for continuing to have a role in state aid policy, in areas like ferry services to island communities or a public sector bid for rail franchises.Holyrood is also on firm ground insisting that it retains powers over food standards. Scottish beef producers are understandably worried about imports of cheap meat from non-EU countries. Salmon farmers have been getting stick from environmentalists over standards in their ponds, but things could become immeasurably worse were existing animal welfare and food safety standards to be relaxed.Of course, this is what ldquomutual recognition should mean in practice: flexibility on both sides. It would be very stupid for the UK Government to refuse to recognise ersity in trading standards across the UK. And not just in order to avoid y court actions over the Sewel Convention.The convention that the Scottish Parliament should pass a consent motion on any UK legislation cutting across its powers was effectively revoked by the UK Supreme Court in . The ldquospider lady Lady Hale and fellow judges ruled that the Sewel Convention had no statutory basis and didnrsquot limit Westminster sovereignty.

At the very least, Mr Gove should make sure that the nations and regions are properly represented on the new regulatory body.Further, on the new points-based immigration scheme outlined this week, there is a strong case for Scotland to be allowed to award extra points for certain occupations ndash like care work ndash where there is an unavoidable shortage. Mr Gove himself proposed this before the Brexit referendum.Mind you, Nicola Sturgeon might be wise to tone down criticism of the ldquoracist policy of Priti Patel.

And importantly, they kept sales of art simmering away.Becky Walker, owner of The Green Gallery, conveniently next door to her home in Buchlyvie, conducted Live at Five Facebook gallery tours on a Saturday night over lockdown. Aided and abetted by husband, Ads, behind the smartphone, this lo-fi approach to guiding viewers around work in the gallery gave fascinating insight into the practice of inidual artists. Occasionally the Walkersrsquo teenagers were berated for hoovering up broadband while they attempted to broadcast live.According to Walker, she has sold ldquomasses of work, and in doing so, has managed to help support her artists. ldquoI have built up really close working relationships with artists over the years, says Walker. ldquoYou feel a real responsibility to them. Most are, of course self-employed so I felt I had to use every means within my power to highlight their work.One night, about a month ago, I joined a ten-minute long private view via Zoom, hosted by The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh. Among the artists being ldquolaunched was Davy Brown, who was my art teacher at Kilmarnock Academy in the s. What a thrill to wave at him across a Zoom room.There was also the additional buzz of eariwigging around some intriguing living room walls including that of Scottish Gallery managing director, Christina Jansen and her husband, Guy Peploe.These small private galleries are an integral part of the ldquoart economy in Scotland, supporting artists by highlighting and marketing their work which for many artists is a real stumbling block.Ken and Susan Lemond have been running their home gallery in Bearsden for the last  years, opening for  weeks of every year with a big summer exhibition and a big Christmas show, interspersed by solo and joint shows every other month.With a down-to-earth, yet knowledgeable approach to art, their customers have grown used to Kenrsquos enthusiastic introduction to dferent styles and approaches to mark-making.As lockdown fell, a joint exhibition of work by Ryan Mutter and Rosanne Barr had been hung and was due to open on March . Both artists are gallery favourites. Mutterrsquos distinctive monochrome oil paintings are inspired by Glasgowrsquos industrial and maritime past, while Barrrsquos loose and expressive landscapes of Scotland have an international fan-base.As well as the Mutter and Barr two-person show, two additional exhibitions were scheduled to run during lockdown and Lemond continued to support the shows using Facebook and Instagram and traditional advertising in the likes of The Herald.ldquoYou feel for the artists, he says. ldquoThey have been painting for months, setting aside work which they would otherwise sell.

At the door, you are welcomed with a smile and an invitation to use the hand-sanitiser provided on tap. There are also face-masks available should you require one.For the new Summer Show, the Lemonds have clearly relished the opportunity to showcase their artistsrsquo work and every available inch is filled by over  paintings and a handful of ceramic artworks.I visited last Monday morning after a busy opening weekend. Sales were brusque even before the doors opened. At the end of June, a Facebook post intimated that  paintings had been sold before all the paintings were listed on its website.Several artists are new to the gallery Ian McWhinnie, Rowan Rosie, John Smyth, Michael Forbes, John-Martin Fulton, Pam Scott and Meg Miller. They are joined by established gallery favourites like Scott Naismith, whose vivid colour-soaked land and skyscapes are being snapped up by collectors, including Paisley-born actor Gerard Butler, who bought one of Naismithrsquos paintings from the Lemonds as a th birthday present to himself last November.Prominent wall space is also given over to the likes of Simon Laurie, Stephanie Rew, Gerry Brander, Marion Drummond, Gordon Mitchell, Marie Louise Wrightson and Gordon Wilson, all of whom sell well with the Lemond Gallery.The result is a joyousto le for art, artists and the small private galleries which support this complex web. ldquoDistance lends enchantment to the view, said Mark Twain and this was definitely the case for my art-starved eyes. Somehow, looking around the walls, the colour seemed more vivid and the textures more stroke-able.There really is something to suit all tastes in this Big Summer Show. From Alison McWhirterrsquos juicy sculptural still les to Polish-born Hanna Kacinielrsquos giant Creme Egg in all its gaudy glory. I was also drawn to Pam Scottrsquos tender paintings in paper especially And Curiouser, which depicts a sorry-looking Alice in Wonderland, adrt and homeless.

Liz Knoxs perfectly composed paintings be they zingy still les or more muted landscapes, are a distillation of hours of looking and thinking before a paint brush is even lted with intent.Knox graduated from Edinburgh College of Art in , having studied under the likes of Robin Philipson and David Michie. Since then, she has consistently painted, even as le got in the way.Until just before the start of lockdown, following on from intensive and gruelling treatment for oesophageal cancer, , she was hard at work on a new, highly-personal, body of work for the Kilmorack Gallery near Beauly. There seems to be a deeper force at wok in her new paintings, especially in paintings such as the eponymous Minds Eye and Monadh .Gallery owner, Tony Davidson, explains: \"This is Kilmorack Galleryrsquos first solo exhibition since lockdown ended and Liz Knox has produced an incredible body of work that has been waiting patiently here since March. I have been holding it back so it can be seen by as many as possible. They deserve it. I love the international flavour in all of the paintings and the mature artistic voice. Such things cannot be faked.\"Few paintings contain the power that is in Liz Knoxs most recent works. Colour and composition take us to a new place: somewhere that exists just beyond the visible world.

The plot sees her learning a final dance to perform with him, without her disapproving parentsrsquo knowledge.Itrsquos a classic Dirty Dancing was the first movie to sell more than one million copies on home video back in the day when that was a thing. It also sold more than  million copies of the soundtrack.There were some iconic songs on that album To accompany the movie - which was set in s America - tracks included In the Still of the Night by The Five Satins, Eric Carmens Hungry Eyes,The Time of My Le by Bill Medley and Jenner Warnes - which won an Oscar for best song - and Shes Like the Wind, by the movies late star, Swayze, who co-wrote and performed the song.ldquoNobody puts baby in the cornerhellipThe moviersquos iconic line is uttered by Swayzersquos character as he pulls Baby, who is sitting with her parents at a table in the corner, up to perform the final dance. It has now become a part of pop culture expression a way of articulating the importance of not allowing anyone to stop you from expressing your true talents.It wasnrsquot smooth sailing In an interview with the American Film Institute, Swayze said Grey was \"gted\" but admitted his \"frustration at trying to keep this girl serious, trying to keep her from crying, trying to keep her focused to get past her fear and her ego\", adding that \"it really was a teaching situation.And the secret to the little moviersquos big success Swayze said, ldquoItrsquos got so much heart, to me.

Weve been together for  years and, oh, the things we have seen, the places we have been.Shes due an MOT soon, I mention to my mum. \"That might be her last,\" she replies. I pat at Stellas air vent, as though it were an ear, so she doesnt hear. Ma Stewart softens and suggests I could keep Stella parked in her driveway, I wouldnt have to trade her in, nothing so brutal.But the thing about Stella is, she may be an old girl of  but she only has about , miles on the clock because, while I love her like a sister , I do practice what I preach. I do go on public transport as much as possible. I do ride my bike everywhere I can.We take a trip to Doncaster once a year to visit our friend Stephanie and we drive to Coatbridge from Glasgow every second week. Other than that, she largely sits in the carpark patiently waiting a next outing.I used to take the train to Doncaster every year, incidentally, until the fares went up wildly. For several years you could get aticket for about pound but then it became cheaper to fly to Europe than to rail southwards, so it was Stella to the rescue.Wed get lost every year, usually going awry somewhere around Scotch corner. One year I was delighted to find a practical application for my English Lit degree. Entirely lost, I stopped at a service station and clocked a red rose above the entrance. A rose  War of the Roses! Red  Bloody hell, Im in Lancaster. Wrong side of the country entirely and thank you Shakespeare.During the coronavirus, however, Stella has never been busier. When le started to slow down but we were still commuting in to the office, I started to drive to work every day due to, at first, a fear of coming in to close contact with people on the bus, and then due to reduced services.The bike was parked because I was having to carry a load of equipment back and forth, for boring reasons, and it was too heavy and didnt fit in my panniers. Friends who were still commuting did likewise, dropping public transport for the private car.While very much staying at home for the vast majority of the time, very rare trips that would normally be done on public transport have been done by car. Again, reduced services and reluctance to be close to strangers.As lockdown has eased, the car has become a focal point for allowing a slightto some normality. First it was drive thru food and drink outlets. Whereas you might previously have sat in, now driving through was the only option.Edinburgh and Glasgow city councils have now reintroduced parking charges, in an attempt to ease congestion and get back on track with carbon emission reduction aims while encouraging greener travel.This is the right thing to do, though it makes it tricky for workers while public transport is still reduced. It also reintroduces the conumdrum of how to encourage people to use our city centres and local high streets now that out-of-town shopping malls with their ample and free parking have reopened.Its not only commuting, shopping and dining that have become car-centric.Ato social and leisure activities is focusing on private vehicles too. There are drive-in comedy shows planned, drive-in movies and a drive-in gig - though this was cancelled due to concerns about localised lockdown restrictions.Its straightforward enough - being in a private vehicle is the most socially distanced place you can be while still enjoying pre-pandemic pursuits.Glasgows plans for a low emission zone in the city centre had made me start to think about what to do with my car. Is it more environmentally friendly to keep a relatively low emissions vehicle or to buy, say, an electric car but have that offset with the emissions generated producing it I hadnt started to look into that yet but had planned to, as well as trying to work outI could manage without the car and join a car club instead.Yet being in an emergency situation has turned all that on its head and made owning a vehicle, once again, the most attractive option, especially with the added boon of the tourism sector opening this week and the five mile travel limit lted.The oft repeated sticking point when pushing for increased levels of active travel has been the suboptimal public transport were faced with.Now, theres really no defence for public transport because its unarguably reduced. It wasnt good enough or joined up enough before, and now there is less of it.Our environmental concerns havent diminished during the Covid- pandemic, they are very much still there and very much in need of relentless, persistent addressing.Its now a bigger ask than ever before to urge people to embrace greener travel, an ask the transport minister made earlier this week. Reflecting on phase three of lockdown being the most dficult transition phase yet, Michael Matheson said, \"The obvious temptation for households with access to a car will be to take that option. However, we know many journeys are less than a few miles and could be covered via active travel, especially over the summer and autumn months.\"Using a car, though, isnt merely a temptation now. Its a common sense, understandable option for many. With a reduction in public transport and so many new car-based activities on offer, there are real additional issues of inequality for those households without a vehicle.The surge of people cycling in lockdown for leisure will, hopefully, be sustained and see those who are biking for exercise start commuting too.Id count myself as an active travel advocate but Im certainly going to have to wean myself back off driving as we move through the pandemic response. Car use is now predicted to rise to % of pre-covid levels. We dont want it any higher. Before lockdown there was so much will towards active travel - we need to be taking great strides towards that again.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

On top of this, I felt it important to show the good side of the farming industry, as it has at times received a lot of bad press.The UK prides itself on one of,not the highest animal welfare standard on the globe. There is as yet no chlorinated chicken or hormone-infused beef here, thankfully. With that comes an obligation on our farmers to care not only for their animals but also the environment around them. That includes limiting pollution of nearby watercourses, the atmosphere and the sequestration of carbon.The power of local is unparalleled and for the most part unknown. This is the case with food consumption as well of course. The food that sits on your plate may well have travelled further in the last day than you have in a letime. The energy expenditure of transport and handling is higher than that gained in food consumption. Let that sink in. The main problem in that system is the reliance on foreign goods. The UK is around - per cent self-sufficient and all of the food we produce is subsidised to keep prices down for you and me, the consumer. The production in the UK comes with the strictest animal welfare regulations, one of the highest-rated required environmental compliance systems on earth as well as creating jobs for four million people.Take pride in what we as a nation have in Scotland. Population-wise we are small, in a world where  countries have more than  million people and  cities have a higher population than us, we are somewhat dwarfed to the point of insignicance. However, we have one undeniable trait, community spirit with an interest in looking out for those around us. We can translate that to looking after our own country, and furthermore our planet by the use of local and reducing the carbon footprint on our most fundamental requirement, food.So, from now on, I implore you all to check what you buy, for the good of the planet, the animals involved in food production as well as yourself.

Have a look online to see what labels are important to you.Remember, food sourced two cities away is worlds closer than half a globe away.Wallace Currie is the founder of RuralKitchen"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11598051.jpg?type=article-full","title":"five-instagram-worthy-views-scotland","story":"After months of uncertainty during the coronavirus lockdown, our countrys hotels, pubs, restaurants and other sectors reopen - with the virus suppressed to low levels acoss Scotland.To mark the news, weve pulled together five of the best on a range of topics.Here arefive of the best views in Scotland:Scottrsquos View, The BordersTake the B road from St Boswells to Kelso, following the signs for Dryburgh Abbey, and then turn onto the B to reach what is said to be Sir Walter Scottrsquos favourite view.A panorama of the River Tweed and the Eildon Hills, the latter a volcanic remnant that was once both home to ancient Romans and Iron Age people, itrsquos a vision that offers an impressive welcome to Scotland.However, Pete Irvine, of Scotland the Best fame, maintains that there is a better view across the road and up the hill, one that takes in the ldquofull panorama from the Cheviots to the Lammermuirs.You could always take in both, of course.Queenrsquos View, PerthshireHead along the B westwards from Pitlochry to get to the Queenrsquos View, which offers an impressive vista of Loch Tummel and beyond to Schiehallion.Queen Victoria was a fan, although, despite what she believed, informed sources suggest the viewpoint is, in fact, named not after her, but for Isabella, the first we of Robert the Bruce.\" alt\"HeraldScotland: Queens View \" class\"editor-image\"Queens View In any case, you donrsquot have to be a royal to enjoy the panorama, and, as it is located on the eastern edge of the Tay Forest park, there are plenty of woodland walks to enjoy once yoursquove had enough of the visual splendour.Dunnet Head, CaithnessJohn OrsquoGroats might get all the attention, but Dunnet Head, at the end of the B, is the most northernmost point of mainland Scotland.As an added bonus, it has its own lighthouse and plenty of opportunities for birdwatchers as its part of a RSPB reserve.Weather permitting, you can look out to Stroma, Hoy and the Orkney mainland on a good day.And the sea clfs arenrsquot bad either.

There must be a determined effort by government to turn, with the same co-operation with those in the best position to advise, to wider health issues, including the needs of those with long-standing conditions, or in care homes.There is an urgent need for focus, too, on the restoration of the economy to health, something that will require attention to the advice of business leaders, and support in those areas that they identy as priorities, rather than the things bureaucrats or politicians think easy or desirable.:Nicola Sturgeon opens up about grieving process at Alex Salmond relationship breakdownJust as matters began to improve only when the government concentrated its efforts on the points that scientic experts thought the most important, the process of economic recovery will depend on the expertise of those who actually create jobs and know best the recipes for stimulating productivity and growth.

Since the NHS is devolved in Scotland our First Minister had the political power to stop, test and trace people entering Scotland via sea and airports from the time the virus first revealed itself to be on its way.Scotland likes to compare itself with similar-sized countries such as Finland, yet it has had  deaths similar-sized Denmark has had  deaths. I suggest that it is an invalid argument to say that we all are wise in hindsight. We do not vote into office governments who learn on the job. The horrendous risk of a pandemic was well known, yet it appears the UK nations were unprepared for the robust action which was needed months ago.However, the creation of the Alliance for Independence is good news for unionists as it reveals a growing sense of disorder, frustration and confusion in the ranks of separatists.Bill Brown, Milngavie.IT is perhaps unsurprising that a number of commentators on the performance of the Scottish Government in managing the coronavirus pandemic have appeared \"underwhelmed\" in spite of plaudits from across the UK for the First Ministerrsquos personal performance. The fact that the BBC produced a misleading documentary related to the Nike conference and even ITV has based morbidity figures for the UK on tested outcomes while figures persistently presented for Scotlandinclude ldquopresumed or suspected deaths related to Covid-, has only helped to engender confusion. Further adding to this confusion is the additional fact that Covid--related deaths registered for England have been consistently \"under-reported\", as noted by the London School of Economics and the Financial Times . Belgium by comparison attributes all lsquoexcess deathsrsquo to Covid- so has a disproportionately high morbidity rate.What we can be certain of is that England, with a relatively younger population, has suffered a Covid- morbidity rate, confirmed from actual tests, nearly  per centhigher than that of Scotland. We also know, from genome sequencing, that the infamous Nike conference did not lead to the spread of the coronavirus across Scotland and that as the UK Coronavirus Act was only introduced on March , the Scottish Government could not have effectively moved into lockdown relatively even earlier than England, irrespective of subsequent postulations.In other words while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have suffered many more deaths in comparison with countries of similar populations across Europe and around the world, with limited powers the devolved governments, including the Scottish Government, have apparently managed the pandemic considerably better than their much larger neighbour which dictated most of the major actions leading to the UKrsquos invidious position atop of confirmed international Covid- death rates.

But the SNP isnrsquot budging, accusing the AFI to trying to split the Yes vote and ldquogaming the system.In an uncharacteristically hysterical column in the Times, my fellow scribbler Kenny Farquharson went further and called the AFI ldquocheats.:Sillars urges Sturgeon to put Yes movement ahead of SNP at Holyrood electionIn which case, the Scottish Greens, Scottish Socialists and others down the years must have been cheating too when they won seats on the list and largely blanked the constituencies.No. As Mr Sillars says, and as I agree, the AFI would simply be using the system thatrsquos there. It canrsquot use any other system, after all, and itrsquos free to act it as it chooses within the law.If MSPs donrsquot like the system, they can - by a two-thirds majority- vote to change it.However that is not to say that opposition charges of electoral manipulation wouldnrsquot stick.As Andy Maciver argued in these pages yesterday, even the perception of shenanigans would give the UK Government a heaven-sent excuse to quibble with the numbers.The hardest result to resist would be a straightforward SNP majority won on a straightforward manesto commitment to a second referendum.But before we race ahead to , consider some practical matters.Mr Sillars insists the logic behind the AFI is ldquoimpeccable. Which only shows the logical and the sensible can y wildly. The AFI misjudges the public mood on multiple levels.We are still in foothills of the coronavirus pandemic - still in the foothills of the infectious stage, far less the economic aftermath.When voters go to the polls next spring, they will be looking for a grown-up, five-year government that can knuckle down on a recovery.The public has so far been impressed by Nicola Sturgeonrsquos air of steady professionalism, and is likely to want more of the same.Voters are categorically not looking for a tone-deaf, single-issue funhouse that wants to subordinate everything to a second referendum and a draining constitutional feud.Who would stand for the AFI As Mr Sillars understatedly admits, this would be a ldquodficulty. Normally, party members rank list candidates in order, with the most popular the most likely to be elected.But as an umbrella alliance, itrsquos not clear what the AFI would do.:Letters: Sturgeon must take off the SNP hat and put on the independence oneA series of local stitch-ups would stink and offer hostages to fortune.But in a vote of supporters, the winners would be those who could out-Indy the rest, the hairy Yes ultras most likely to put off casual voters, especially hesitant No switchers.Or perhaps the AFI could resurrect some well-kent carpet baggers Mr Thompson is open to Alex Salmond or former jailbird Mr Sheridan joining his merry band.Mr Salmondrsquos friends are dismissive, but some of Mr Sheridanrsquos old pals are already involved.The AFI could be the party that puts the Yes into Yesterdayrsquos Men.And I think it would be mostly men, too. Donrsquot hold your breath for reserved top places for women or gender zipping when the has-beens and the hairies are trying to grab a taxpayer-funded ego trip at Holyrood.Candidate vetting is hard enough for even established parties.With the AFI needing at least  candidates, and no threshold other than a Yes badge, you can bet there would be some absolute rockets in there, tarnishing the SNP by association. The opposition would have a field day, the voters qualms.But perhaps the biggest problem for the AFI is that it reeks of conceit.It assumes the election is in the bag for its side, and the only question is how big the Yes majority will be.With this arrogant sense of entitlement, it believes it can come from nowhere to piggyback on the SNPrsquos success that the SNP should step aside for it and voters should trot to the polls to elect whatever ragbag of candidates it manages to assemble.It then believes its sole aim should take precedent for the next five years, whatever is happening with Covid, the economy, or anything .The AFI is lucky to have logic on its side.

It was, he declared ldquobrazen contempt for democracy and ldquoa scandal in the making.The right-wing lobbyist Andy McIver, writing in The Herald, suggested it could backfire by handing the Cummings Johnson axis at Westminster a pretext for questioning a mandate built on such a political obscenity.

I suspect though, that his main reason is a loss of confidence in the SNPrsquos route and rate of travel towards independence.

If this party hadnrsquot been so incompetent and arrogant over such a prolonged period there could be no prospect of a second Yes party becoming the official opposition at Holyrood. If they hadnrsquot fallen into the curious habit of electing leaders who were not remotely equal to the job this could have been avoided.

Up to  per cent of the global population is expected to live in urban areas by , presenting sustainability strategists with a huge challenge.Mathis Wackernagel, the networkrsquos Founder and PresidentThe solution is likely to revolve around smart cities featuring energy-efficient buildings, integrated zoning, compact planning and effective options for people-powered and public transportation. The last of these is particularly important as cars account for  per cent of the worldrsquos carbon footprint.The concept of Earth Overshoot Day comes from the San Francisco-based Global Footprint Network, a sustainability research organisation whose executives were responsible for the development of the Ecological Footprint sustainability metric in the s.This not-for-profit body has partnered with the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyto promote this yearrsquos event. ldquoItrsquos an alignment of interests and a way of pushing forward SEPArsquos own agenda, says Mathis Wackernagel, the networkrsquos Founder and President.ldquoSEPA also takes a unique approach to environmental regulation. Its attitude is thatit needs to punish people then it can do that to the worst offenders who donrsquot follow regulations, but also that itrsquos not just about punishing, but also encouraging the right behaviour.ldquoIt has agreements with companies and cities, asking how it can help them in areas such as red tape and being easier on themthey show responsibility.ldquoI think thatrsquos a wonderful approach as it looks at things from a one planet perspective. If you just regulate here and there then yoursquore actually missing the big challenge we are facing ndash that we are not fitting within naturersquos budget.The aim is to hold a launch event for Earth Overshoot Day in Glasgow ndash which will place itself firmly on the global sustainability map by hosting the prestigious COP international environmental summit next year ndash on August .ldquoBecause of Covid-, wersquore still working out the details, but it will probably involve local people attending, with video conferencing for others. We will interview people with dferent perspectives from around the world, perhaps editing these into a more compact format for viewing by the public.ldquoBy doing that, we will help people to understand the story and thatgovernments look after their futures, then thatrsquos good for the population. It will also help decision makers to determine their strategies.Wackernagel is effusive in his praise for Scotland and the enthusiasm with which it has adopted sustainability objectives. Born in Switzerland, his love affair with the country is near-lelong.ldquoIt was only the second foreign country I travelled to as a child and I really developed a warm affection for it. Its cultural symbols are really out there.He praises the fact that, despite a historic dependence on fossil fuel exploitation, Scotland has been a leader in recognising the need to decarbonise, with huge reductions in carbon emissions and an explosive growth in the generation of renewable energy.ldquoThis recognises that our future depends on some level of resource security, and that in turn shows an insight that Irsquom sorry to report is still quite rare. I was astonished at how proactive Scotland has become around these issues.ldquoItrsquos also interesting that the economic advisers to the Scottish Government view resource as a signicant ingredient. They see that they have skin in the game. They are asking lsquo we donrsquot do these things, how will we be able to live rsquo That is healthy ndash itrsquos tackling the question of whether Scotland is destroying Scotland or building Scotland.Earth Overshoot Day is still a relatively new concept here, but it is establishing itself around the world and particularly in France and Germany, where media interest has been intense. ldquoThe Pope talked about it in an interview and showed that he actually understood it better than many others.Ecological overshoot has been a reality since at least the s, though carbon levels have been building up for more than  years. By using more renewable natural resources than the planet can regenerate, we are effectively drawing down the biospherersquos capital rather than living off its annual interest.The consequences of this are sadly predictable. We are already seeing problems such as soil erosion, overgrazing, desertication, species extinction and reduced crop yields. If humanity continues to exploit the planetrsquos natural resources in this way, the result will be the further degradation and possibly collapse of ecosystems.The message of Earth Overshoot day is a simple one, but it still faces challenges from sceptics who question its veracity. ldquoSome people say itrsquos crazy because theyrsquoll open their fridge on August  and there is still beer in it, so all this must be wrong, Wackernagel says. ldquoOf course there will be beer in the fridge. In the same way, you can spend money and you will still have money. Butyou spend more than you earn, itrsquos not something you can do forever. You just keep depleting your asset base, and that canrsquot go on.------------------------------The world was ill-prepared for Covid. Will we allow ourselves to be so ill-prepared for the looming climate risk By Bob Downes,Chair of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency January , a few short months ago, now seems a world away. Then, as every year, the World Economic Forum was meeting at DAVOS in Switzerland. Their focus was unequivocally on our environmental futures: lsquoThe top five risks facing the world are now all linked to the Climate Crisisrsquo.You can be sure that the agenda for next yearrsquos probable lsquovirtualrsquo WEF forum will look very dferent. But should it be dferent  It is clear that COVID- is not a new risk. The world just missed treating it with the importance it deserved. We must not make the same mistake with climate change.In the Financial Times, Tim Harford has queried why we fail to plan for these major risks. He quotes Bazerman and Watkins from their  work ldquoPredictable Surprises: The disasters you should have seen coming. Harford concludes our problem is that faced with clear risks we still fail to act.Nearly  years ago I attended an enthralling seminar in Philadelphia on futures scenarios which included environmental catastrophe, religious conflict, inequalities, mass migration, diseases and terrorism.The seminar kicked off around am that morning. Some way through the presentation the Chairman took the floor. The date was th September . Warning signs were there beforehand of what was about to happen, graphically depicted in Lawrence Wrightrsquos book The Looming Tower.Perhaps more hidden in plain sight were the seeds of COVID- in SARS, MERS and Ebola. It appears that we donrsquot like making investments in what might happen, because that would mean forgoing more immediate priorities.The risk this time is that we will become pre-occupied with the need for stability, normality and most of all with personal economic security.Climate change may not easily find space in the minds of citizens anywhere. If we are to win the hearts and minds for the battle against climate change, benefits must be clear to people and communities. The threat of what lsquomightrsquo happen may not work.According to a group of experts: lsquoEventhe world agreed to maintain all the pandemic enforced restrictions on travel and consumption, the emissions saved would amount to almost nothing compared with what is needed to achieve the Paris Agreement climate target.rsquoThe investment case must be an economic renewal plan which mitigates climate change while providing for the personal economic security and wellbeing we all desire. This will take systemic changes utilising our technological and innovative capacity in a reframed set of tools which assess public investment s quite dferently. It will need an accompanying fiscal and regulatory framework appropriately geared to longer term sustainability. Reshaping all these things can provide economic security through clever design.Many businesses including investment institutions were onto this before COVID- hit. That momentum for change can be accommodated as we plan the future out of the current emergency. Nineteen years ago in Philadelphia the threats were clear. Each has come true ndash most dramatically the tragic attack on the Twin Towers.The world was ill-prepared for COVID-. Will we allow ourselves to be so ill-prepared for the looming climate risk www.sepa.org.uk-----------------------------------We must choose our future by design ... not disasterMathis Wackernagel of Global Footprint Network on why we should take no comfort from the reduction in our global footprint caused by the onset of the COVID- pandemicLast year, our planetrsquos ecological budget only lasted till July th. For the rest of the year, humanity lived off depleting our planet, growing our ecological debt and with it, the fragility of our economies. This debt shows up as excessive greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, bioersity loss, air pollution, groundwater depletion, and deforestation ndash among other impacts.This year has been dferent. The economic slowdown imposed by the COVID- pandemic has reduced the global Ecological Footprint, pushing this yearrsquos Earth Overshoot Day to August . Thatrsquos the latest wersquove seen since .This phenomenon demonstrates that shting resource consumption patterns in a short timeframe is possible.However, true sustainability that allows all to thrive within Earthrsquos ecological budget can only be achieved by design, not by disaster.This yearrsquos reduction in Footprint does not come from intentional changes that decarbonised energy, made cities more resource efficient, or yielded a healthier and more resilient food system.It was paid for by imposed restraint, in some cases with signicant human suffering. The sudden year-over-year Ecological Footprint contraction is a far cry from the systemic change which is required to achieve both ecological balance and peoplersquos well-being, two inextricable components of a workable future.By choosing design over disaster, we can address this imbalance. In fact, it is the only sensible path forward, one that the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency calls ldquoone-planet prosperity. Because Earthrsquos ecological budget is not up for negotiation, the only choice before us is whether we build one-planet prosperity or one-planet misery.Scotlandrsquos COVID- recovery is an opportunity to choose. No society can sht overnight to a thriving economy in a world characterized by climate change, biological resource constraints, and phased-out fossil fuels.No country, city, or company can rebuild, retrofit or repurpose its infrastructure instantaneously. Clearly, those who plan ahead stand a far better chance to thrive than those who keep investing in the obsolete resource-intensive economy.This foresight is emerging overwhelmingly from women, starting with the youth inspiring the FridaysFuture movement. Angela Merkel has pushed Germanyrsquos energy transition for years.Ursula von der Leyen and Christine Lagarde advocate for Europersquos ldquoGreen New Deal.Carolina Schmidt, the Chilean minister of environment presiding COP, and Patricia Espinosa, who heads the UNrsquos climate convention, fight for the implementation of the Paris Agreement.Last but not least, Nicola Sturgeon has been championing and implementing one of the most rigorous and thoughtful decarbonisation strategies of any region in the world.We have learned from COVID- that protecting ourselves is the only effective way to protect others. The recovery is the opportunity to do just that: preparing ourselves so we can thrive in a predictably challenging future.While this is necessary for each communityrsquos and companyrsquos own benefit, it is also a most generous act because everyone investing in their own long-term success makes it more possible for others to succeed. Unlike a soccer championship, this is a positive sum game.To bridge the gap between the UNrsquos COP meetings ndash with the COP now postponed to November  in Glasgow ndash and act on the urgent need to accelerate the transformation, Global Footprint Network will launch this yearrsquos Earth Overshoot Day in Scotland.With its newly launched recovery plan, Scotlandrsquos statement to the world is clear: foresight and innovation are critical for onersquos own future.Most importantly, as it thinks pro-actively about what its future needs to look like, Scotland is seizing the perfect opportunity to avoid going back to what was broken and to build a future worthy of its great past.www.footprintnetwork.org"},{"url":null,"title":"tales-scots-women-100-years","story":"The National Library of Scotlandtoured the hugely successful feature, \"Her Century: Scottish Women on Film\", in  cinemas, arts centres and festivals across the country in the lead up to lockdown.The curated collection of archive footage, showing \"ordinary women and girls\", spanning the th century, was scheduled to be the main attraction at the NLS George IV Bridge building in Edinburgh over the summer.Instead, from Monday, the Library, in partnership with Film Hub Scotland, part of the British Film InstitutesFilm Audience Network, will make the film available to view online for two months.The \"at home\" premiere will be introduced by Dr Emily Munro, from the NLS Moving Image Archive, who curated the film.

Please follow the instructions we’re providing in order to minimise any risks to yourself and our cleaning staff.“Work is carrying on to re-open more public toilets over the next few weeks # keep an eye on social media and the OIC website for further updates.”OIC have also provided the answers to some frequently asked questions about the re-opening of the public toilets.We need to introduce quite a lot of physical changes to our public toilets in order to meet Scottish Government guidance. We are also having to arrange to clean them more often, and so we are discussing with our staff and contractors about how this will be done. This is why we can’t open all the toilets on the th, but we are aiming to have all public toilets open during August. There will be physical changes both outside and inside the toilets. You will be asked to follow physical distancing markers outside the toilet, and not all the facilities inside the toilet will be available. Because of this, please allow a little longer for your visit as you may need to wait for the toilets to be free. The toilets will need to be cleaned more frequently, and we will provide liquid soap for you to use to wash your hands, as well as a supply of cleaning products as required. We would ask everyone to please leave the soap and the cleaning products in the toilets for the next person to use # please do not take them away with you. There is still some element of risk around using public toilets, and that is why we are having to make the changes described above. We are following Scottish Government guidance, which can be found here: https:www.gov.scot publications coronavirus-covid--public-and-customer-toilets-guidance pages hygiene-measures We have carried out risk assessments for each site and also a general risk assessment for the process of cleaning the toilets during the pandemic. All of our staff are being briefed on any changes to their working practices and equipment, including PPE where needed, will be provided. Trade Unions have been provided with the risk assessments and given the chance to make any comments. We are currently working with our cleaners, including those who do relief cleaning for the council, as well as our contractors to assess their availability.

There are plenty of places to go and things to do to suit every budget. Here is our guide to the numerous great days out in across our region.WITH BEER gardens entering their second week of opening in Scotland and the five-mile restriction on non-essential travel lted, the country has begun to look forward to a summer of fun.While social distancing measures are still in place and it is important not to take undue risks, there are plenty of things to do safely.Zoos and animal parks around Scotland re-opened on June , and now that the five-mile restriction has eased they canwelcome visitors from near and far. Edinburgh Zoo, Five Sisters Zoo in West Lothian, Blair Drummond Safari Park in Stirling and the Highland Wildle Park in the Cairngorms National Park have all reopened, with customers asked to book in advance. Fe Zoo suffered a devastating fire just days after reopening after the Covid- lockdown, but no animals were harmed and owners have said they hope toto normality as soon as possible thanks to support and fundraising from the local community.Stately homes and gardens have also reopened, with several National Trust for Scotland properties now open to visitors.These include Culzean Castle and Country Park in Ayrshire, Threave Garden in Dumfries and Galloway, Brodie Castle’s garden and grounds, Arduaine Garden in Argyll and Crathes Castle’s garden and estate in Aberdeenshire. Historic Environment Scotland has said that it will monitor the situation and reopen properties in due course.Unstaffed outdoor sites are already open, so visitors can enjoy walks around Edinburgh’s Holyrood Park and West Lothian’s Linlithgow Peel among others.Walkers and climbers are now welcome to visit the country’s national parks to enjoy some outdoor exercise. Guidelines remain to avoid touching surfaces or opening gates where possible, to follow signs and avoid coming into contact with farm workers where applicable, and to keep dogs on leads and avoid areas known to be busy. Pubs and restaurants without door space have also been allowed to reopen. Glasgow’s The Cranside Kitchen, near the Rotunda, has claimed to be the country’s largest beer garden, with a free-to-enter area seating more than  guests with social distancing measures in place.The beer garden offers a range of drinks alongside food from five popular Glasgow restaurants, Rioja, Halloumi, Pickled Ginger, Kilmurry  Co and La Rotunda. In Edinburgh the Corn Exchange has billed itself as the largest beer garden in the city, having transformed the car park into a space where people can enjoy drinks as well as play darts, ping-pong, swing ball and watch sport, all while observing the necessary hygiene routines. With hundreds of smaller beer gardens open around the country – including Dundee’s The Kilted Kangaroo and Aberdeen’s Siberia Bar and Hotel – there is no shortage of options for enjoying this summer safely and enjoying good times in Scotland.Five Sisters Zoo in West Lothian opened up to the public on June , with a number of new measures in place to help prevent the spread of the virus. These include mandatory advance booking to avoid crowding and queues, a oneway system around the zoo, hand-washing stations and the cancellation of any activities which involve the public touching or feeding the animals. The soft play area and restaurant are also closed, but food kiosks are still open.Keeper talks have been cancelled, but several videos of the talks have been made available online.The zoo is currently opening at about one third of capacity to ensure space for social distancing, and owners say they will monitor the situation and review measures in place after the first couple of weeks. “It’s been good so far, the feedback we’ve had has been really positive,” said assistant manager Gary Curran. “The past few months have been quite dficult financially, so it was a relief to be able to open safely.” He added: “We’re looking forward to the rest of the summer and hopefully some more good weather! “People really enjoy it here and they’re having a good time so far.”Summer is here and our colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens beckon. Many attractions are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and prebooked time slots, so the UK Government recommends looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations you plan to visit before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. To make your days out as enjoyable as possible, we encourage you to plan your trip in advance and to check all of the important facilities and attractions, while looking after our great outdoors.To ensure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, here are a few simple steps to help make planning easy. When planning your trip, check that important facilities – like toilets and car parks – are open before you travel so you’re not caught short. If you have an attraction in mind, please check online to seeyou need to pre-book a time slot.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem that you can brag to friends about. Keep two metres apart from anyone outside your household where you can. This applies to walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing too. Wear a face covering at all times when on public transport like buses, trains, taxis and minicabs.Make sure you have a bank card because many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments and you don’t want to miss out on that ice cream.And take hand sanitiser with you – you don’t know where will be open for you to wash your hands.Leave the car behind where possible and visit attractions by walking or cycling.Please remember that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for re opening tourism.To help you enjoy summer safely, please check the respective official sources for information prior to travelling by using the website visitbritain gb en knowbefore-you-goWith many of our favourite attractions now beginning to reopen their doors, Scottish tourism bosses have teamed up with Tourism Northern Ireland, VisitEngland and VisitWales to come up with a way for people to check whether they are “good to go”. The We’re Good To Go initiative was developed jointly by the four UK Visitor agencies. The UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark will provide a “ring of confidence” for visitors as the tourism sector works towards reopening.The We’re Good To Go mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective Government and public health guidance, have carried out a COVID- risk assessment and checked that they have the required processes in place, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. The scheme is free to join.UK Government tourism minister Nigel Huddleston said: “I want to encourage the public to experience a great holiday this summer and be confident that they can do so safely.“This new industry standard will show people that tourism businesses, destinations and attractions are adhering to the guidance. “It puts safety first and is an important move in getting this industry back up and running.”VisitScotland chief executive Malcolm Roughead, said: “We are pleased that after a very dficult few months Scotland’s tourism industry are starting to welcome visitors.“However, it’s important to remember that things may be a little dferent now, there may be reduced facilities available orbusy, a greater need to follow physical distancing restrictions to protect yourself and others. “Planning and researching will also become an important part of the holiday experience and we really want visitors to ‘know before they go’ when it comes to travel checking what is open and pre-bookingrequired.”To obtain the mark businesses must complete a self-assessment through the online  https:goodtogo.visitbritain your-business-good-to-go-scotland including a check-list confirming they have put the necessary processes in place, before receiving certication and the We’re Good To Go mark for display in their premises and online. Businesses across the UK are assessed according to their respective national guidance including the social distancing and cleanliness protocols that must be in place. vw, px\"  For more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The next census had been due to take place in .Scottish secretary for economy, fair Work and culture, Fiona Hyslop, said: #COVID- is the biggest single public health challenge facing us in more than  years and as in many other areas of le, the ongoing disruption is impacting on the vital preparations for the census.“Following careful consideration and on recommendation of National Records of Scotland , ministers have informed the Scottish Parliament of their intention to move Scotland’s Census date to March . This reflects the unprecedented impact which COVID- is having across a wide range of sectors.“We recognise Scotland’s Census remains more relevant than ever in the current climate, as it allows important planning decisions to be made informed by the make-up of Scotland’s population.“This decision was not taken lightly. However the quality of the census data must remain robust, and by moving to  National Records of Scotland can continue to deliver a census which ensures the highest possible response rate from people across Scotland, to allow government, local authorities and key services plan for every element of public le, from building homes to NHS support.“NRS will continue to work closely with stakeholders and partners to ensure that appropriate data is available to support work that was expecting to make use of Census  data, particularly for key funding allocations and policy decisions.”Paul Lowe, registrar general and chief executive of NRS, added: “The priority and responsibility of NRS is to put in place a census that enables everyone across Scotland to participate, so that information collected can be used to produce the analyses and deliver the benefits required by the people of Scotland.“The census is a unique count of every household in Scotland and in the next census, for the first time, the majority of people will be encouraged to complete their questionnaire online. This will require a signicant field force and face-to-face engagement in an effort to support digital participation, engage with the public and raise awareness of census across the population.“The census is a major logistical operation and the twelve months running up to a census are vital in planning and testing the effectiveness and security of systems and processes. COVID- restrictions have delayed or prevented many of these key activities, including engagement with key organisations, from taking place over recent months.“This is the right decision for Scotland which will allow us to undertake a high quality and safe census in  that will produce the rich data we need for many years to come.

If they do not apply for a registration or stop activities, SEPA will take enforcement action which could see them subjected to fines or criminal prosecution.There is also an important role for the public, with a warning that the use of unlicensed waste collectors could result in waste contributing to fly-tipping and other illegal activity.“Don’t engage the services of people who are not authorised,” Ms Shearer explained.“Remember, services that sound too good to be true often are, and could lead to your waste being illegally fly-tipped or disposed of by other illegitimate means.“Anyone offering to take your waste away should be able to provide a waste carrier registration number and tell you the named facility they will take the waste to –they can’t provide this information, don’t allow them to take your waste.“Now more than ever, Scots are recognising the importance of local services like recycling and the part we all play in correctly managing our waste. You have the responsibility to take care of your waste andwe trace it back to you we can take enforcement action against you too. We don’t want people to be put in that situation so make sure that anyone who takes your waste for disposal is properly accredited.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

This, along with other key public health measures, such as social distancing and ensuring good hand and respiratory hygiene, will help us to reduce community transmission of Covid-.“For Test, Trace and Protect to work, everyone in Northern Ireland must prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and be tested to help protect ourselves, our families and our communities.”The Minister added: “This is likely to become part of everyday le for the foreseeable future until an effective vaccine for Covid- is developed and a vaccination programme delivered.”Olive MacLeod, Interim Chief Executive of the Public Health Agency, said: “The initial pilot phase of Covid- contact tracing began in Northern Ireland on  April and as of  May we have been tracing all positive cases. Northern Ireland was the first part of the UK to have this service established and operational. “Our contact tracing team is made up of trained staff who contact the person who has tested positive identy those people with whom they have had close contact and could be at risk of developing Covid- and in turn contact them to advise them on the appropriate next steps.”Mrs MacLeod concluded: “By this stage most people will be aware of Covid- symptoms which are a high temperature a new, continuous cough or a new loss of or change in sense of smell or taste.

This is precisely why hymns have been banned at church services.And so, the number of diagnosed cases is now beginning to rise again - as of Friday, there were  more confirmed cases in Northern Ireland, with  people testing positive for the virus in the Causeway Coast and Glens area over the past seven days.It is clear that Limavady and the surrounding areas are now at the centre of Covid- spike, the full effects of which cannot yet be predicted.It#s certainly a matter of consternation for people living in the area who are regarded as extremely vulnerable to the virus, coming just weeks before shielding is paused.Experts have conceded that it isn#t always possible to track everyone down and so we must be prepared for the possibility that the number of positive cases may continue to rise in the coming days - even beyond Limavady itselfIt is also fair to surmise that the virus may have travelled over the mountain towards Coleraine, Portrush and potentially beyond. This will, of course, have implications given the fact the North Coast is a popular day trip destination for people from all over.Health officials are currently undertaking a trace, test and isolate programme to try and halt the spread of Covid-, but the system itself has limitations.Experts have conceded that it isn#t always possible to track everyone down and so we must be prepared for the possibility that the number of positive cases may continue to rise in the coming days - even beyond Limavady itself.And with an increase in cases, there is a growing likelihood that more people will require hospital treatment.Of course, we don#t know the ages and medical history of all of those who have been infected, but it isn#t too far a leap to say that someone may even lose their le.It is a sobering thought, but it is the tragic reality now that Covid- is endemic in the community.Looking back, the Health Minister and Chief Medical Officer have warned that complacency cannot be allowed to set in and commenting on the Limavady cluster on Thursday, Robin Swann said he was not surprised by the outbreak.Health officials have said repeatedly that this would happen as social distancing measures were relaxed and on Friday, Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Association#s NI Council, said we will continue to see similar outbreaks in the coming months.However, the future is very much in our hands it is our responsibility to keep each other safe.There are so many measures we can adopt to stop the spread of the virus.Frequent handwashing, maintaining an appropriate distance from others, and wearing a face covering in an enclosed space - they will all go some way to slow the spread of Covid-.No one wants toto the full lockdown that was put in place in March butwe can#t bring clusters like these under control, then that is what we are heading forThe cluster in Limavady is a warning shot and it is welcome that some local organisations are taking it seriously, with  Derry GAA clubs suspending activity as a precautionary measure.There has even been talk of a local lockdown, and it is a very real possibilitythe number of cases diagnosed in the area continues on the same trajectory.No one wants toto the full lockdown that was put in place in March butwe can#t bring clusters like these under control, then that is what we are heading for.Doctors and scientists have warned that this is a potentially more dangerous period than during the original outbreak.There is no doubt that complacency has set in, there is a certain fatigue with social distancing.The fact that we haven#t experienced the predicted thousands of fatalities has to some extent contributed to this.However, the cluster in Limavady should act as a reminder that Covid- is as dangerous and as insidious as ever.

The offences each carry a maximum penalty of up to  years imprisonment.The respondent had booked  international flights into or out of the UK between May ,  and May , . On  occasions, the outward andflights were within a matter of hours. The European Arrest Warrantstated that Mr Adams was stopped at Belfast International by Border Force officers on May ,  travelling with only hand luggage. The warrant said Mr Adams confirmed to Border Force officers that he had packed the bag himself.When asked whether anyone had given him anything to take out of the country, he replied: Yes, €,.The warrant stated that Mr Adams was interviewed under caution on May ,  and made no comment to questions asked in relation to the cash, his personal background, his employment status and financial position. Counsel for the State, Aoe Carroll BL, previously made an application to the court for Mr Adams# surrender and asked the court to let the chips fall where they may. She submitted that the respondent#s objections to surrender were speculative, vague, unsupported by evidence and were subject to innumerable iables so that the court could not refuse surrender on foot of same. Ms Carroll said she was satisfied surrender to the UK would not give rise to an unfair trial. She said nothing in the warrant was defective, nothing arose in relation to Brexit as the status quo remains in place, so surrender was not prohibited.Furthermore, Ms Carroll said thatan order for surrender was made against Mr Adams, she would be asking the court to postpone handing him over to the authorities in Northern Ireland until domestic proceedings had been determined.The court has heard that the respondent#s position was complicated by the fact that he has been ed for trial before the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on separate money laundering charges, and his trial is due to take place in Dublin in June . Mr Adams had contested his surrender at the High Court, with his lawyers saying that he should not be extradited to Northern Ireland due to Brexit. Counsel for Mr Adams, Paul Comiskey O#Keeffe BL, had argued thathis client was convicted and sentenced in the Republic first, there would be an infringement of his rights to a fair trial in Northern Ireland in the future.He claimed this is because the UK would no longer be in the transitional period provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement between the UK and the European Union. He further submitted that there was a real risk that the fundamental rights of the respondent would not be respected. Ordering his surrender to the UK yesterday, Mr Justice Paul Burns said he was satisfied that the extradition of Mr Adams was not prohibited by part three of the European Arrest Warrant Act . In light of the domestic offences brought against Mr Adams, the judge postponed his surrender to the UK until a later date.He remanded him in custody until July , .

A spokesperson from SONI denied the payments in Northern Ireland were excessive, and said a long-term strategy including progressing the North-South interconnector in Ireland would steadily reduce costs for customers.Mr Wells, a DUP MLA who has had the party whip withdrawn, said: This is basically wind farm owners being paidto do nothing. In the initial surge to get people signed up to wind farms and green energy, the incentives were extremely attractive.He said operators should no longer be compensated for quieter periods, given the relatively low costs after start-up. Each farmer gets a payment of £, per turbine a year for  years for the land they rent the turbines on.He added: I do think it#s time to review these contracts to make sure they meet the needs of the real world.REF director Dr John Constable pointed to a weakness in Scotland#s grid system that has already caused an excessive expansion in wind farms, resulting in large constraint payouts. Mr Constable added: I agree these constraint payments should never have been paid at all, it#s just a mistake. One thing you could say is that constraint payments are just getting going in Northern Ireland.Wind farms are still being built so it#s only going to get worse and the scale of the problem is very large.The constraints so far in the GB system in  has already cost £.m. You really don#t want to head that way in Northern Ireland.SONI spokesperson Natasha Sayee said it was necessary to limit wind energy on occasions for safety and security reasons, with windfarms owners compensated for the electricity they planned to sell.She explained that a signicant amount of work has taken place to improve Northern Ireland#s grid system and minimise constraints.At present, the grid carries up to % renewable energy at any one time, with a target to increase this to % by .There has also been investment in the Curraghmulkin project in Tyrone and the Brockaghboy kV line near Garvagh which connects clusters of windfarms to the transmission grid. During the first three months of this year, she added there was % more wind generation in Northern Ireland and % more available wind energy than in the same period last year.She said the North South Interconnector would also be a game-changer in maximising efficiency.In doing so it will also reduce costs to consumers across the island of approximately £m annually, rising to £m in savings by .She added that investing in technologies such as battery storage to hold excess wind energy would allow more upgrades for future generations.Steven Agnew, head of the NI Renewable Industries Group , said renewable energies had saved NI consumers £m since .With % of its electricity coming from renewables, Northern Ireland is a leader in the type of low-carbon energy generation that will play a key role in our green economic recovery, he said.He called constraints an unfortunate consequence of a small island system that was paid to all forms of generation.In renewables, he said this was more than compensated for due to reduced wholesale prices.

My kids love coconut and white chocolate and my wee girl has Rice Krispies every day for breakfast. And I just thought Cadbury#s don#t really have a bar that has coconut in it, she explained.It was also a case of second time lucky for the BT telecoms employee. She previously entered her recipe idea, but was not selected.The first time I had entered the same bar and never heard anything, until I got an email to say I hadn#t been chosen. But I thought I#m going to enter that again. So probably last August I picked the three same flavours, she recalled.Then last September or October I got an email from Cadbury#s to say that I was down to the final . I just thought: #Is this a joke #The -year-old said she was shocked and delighted to then learn she had been selected as one of the three finalists who would travel to England to pay a visit to Cadbury#s headquarters in Bournville and witness their recipes being made into chocolate bars.I just couldn#t believe it. The smell of chocolate when you get in there... it just hits you. It#s amazing! I met the team and the other finalists. I had a brilliant wee day, she said.Going up against Gillian#s Coconutty is #Out of the Blueberry#, which has blueberry flavoured nuggets and white chocolate-coated cereal balls, and #Crunchy Honeycomb#, a mix of milk chocolate and caramel flavoured fudge cubes, chopped hazelnuts and honeycomb pieces.Gillian said she loved popping into the supermarket to see the bar on sale for the first time. It#s very exciting. Already I#ve had loads of people tagging me on Facebook, saying that they can#t wait to try the bar, or they#ve already tried and loved it, she added.Having tried it, I recommend taking a couple of bites, that way you get the full impact of the coconut.The chocolate bars are exclusive to buy in Tesco until July , when they go on sale at other retailers. At that stage, added Gillian, three mystery celebrities will champion each of the flavours online. I did get a buzz seeing it on the display, she said. The kids are over the Moon, saying: #Are you famous now, mummy  And I say: #I wouldn#t go that far, but everyone knows my signature now#.The overall winner will be decided by a public vote at www.cadburyinventor, which accounts for % of the vote, with the remaining % split between other online polls and sales. The winning bar will be on shelves as a permanent product at the start of .

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much.

Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Unfortunately, those musicians have been unable to entertain audiences since March, except via Zoom, which is no substitute for the interactive and much more personal live experience. For musicians, performing is their leblood, it is not only what they love to do but live shows are the most dependable source of income. Leading artists in the country recently wrote a letter to the Department for Communitiesin a plea to provide urgent financial support to save the local music industry. googletag.cmd.push It is not only the musicians but the likes of producers, sound engineers, stage crew, management, live venue staff, photographers and freelance workers in the industry who are struggling. ‘STALLED’ Speaking to the Derry News, PORTS bass player and vocalist, Steven McCool, shared the dficulties experienced during lockdown but also about the welcome prospect of festivals and gigs on the horizon as restrictions have eased. He said: “At the start of the year we had begun working on a release schedule for our first new release in four years. “This includes, making music videos, touring etc. We had been finishing the last few songs of our next album. Then came the pandemic. “All our plans were stalled. We couldnt releasewe couldnt tour. We couldnt get together to finish the album or music videos. “We play live to build up the finances to release new music so that was another wall for us. “As things have started to open up, we have been able to roll out a bit of a schedule again and with Stendhal Festival going ahead, we can use that to coincide with a release. “Hopefully now as things start to open up we can get back on-board and out playing again.”  Hannah Richardson vocalist and guitarist in CHERYMechoed Steven’s view saying it’s ‘definitely been a dficult’ time for musicians. “With no furlough, no other source of income and a lot of uncertainty surrounding when it’s safe for us to get back to work,” she explained. A grant from Help Musicians NI at the start of lockdown her going for a while, Hannah said. “Spoty and the Arts Council have also been trying to issue grants to musicians which is extremely helpful but nothing compared to what we would be bringing inwe were allowed to work, especially now around festival season. “I just hope the live music scene is able to sustain itself once we see the other side of this and hope people continue to support local musicians and music venues so we can get back as quickly and safely to doing the thing we love most,” she added. Aoe Boyle, known by her stage name Reevah , had been planning to embark on her first headline tour to accompany the release of her EP A Dferent Light in April  May, followed by a busy summer of gigs and festivals. All of these plans have now been put on the back burner. As things stand the future for the arts is very uncertain, she explained. As anindependentartist the financial impact has been quitedevastatingand has affected not only our plans for the immediate future but for the next year. However, were so aware of the vast number of artists who are in a similar or even worse positions so are trying to remain as positive as possible about the future.  SOCIAL DISTANCING Stendhal Festival captured the attention of a worldwide audience after announcing the first socially distanced festival in Northern Ireland on August - aptly named ‘UNLOCKED’. It will take place at Ballymully Cottage Farm in Limavady where numbers will be limited but the audience will be treated to the very best talent on the island as well as beer gardens, delicious food and ‘perhaps best of all, over  acres of socially distant outdoor scenic countryside to enjoy’. Most festivals have however cancelled and are already trying to regroup for next year. Bars have also begun to reopen but in an effort to maintain social distancing live music has been actively discouraged. Theatres will open their doors at the end of the month but with large gatherings prohibited and social distancing mandatory for the foreseeable future there are uncertain times ahead. Strength N.I.A and Red Organ Serpent Sound frontman, Rory Moore, said it came as a ‘hefty blow’ to find out that all of their shows were cancelled for . “Live shows go hand in hand with releasing new music and sustaining oneself as a musician both financially, spiritually and emotionally. “It has been a pretty hefty blow. But working alone and self-isolation is something I have been used to for many years, the abnormality of the situation is something that comes with the turf of being a songwriter and performer,” he reflected. “Radio and social media are very important at this time for sustaining a career in music. “We hope that our fan base will pre order our album that is set for early release in  and fingers crossed we will be out playing again towards the middle of next year.” GOVERNMENT RESPONSE The Department for Communities said it is aware of the ‘immensely challenging’ situation currently facing the local music industry. The department has been in consultation with local industry representatives and further discussions are planned in the near future. In advance of the reopening of theatres and seated venues, the DfC is working in partnership with the Arts Council NI and key stakeholders, with officials having established a Consultative Arts and Culture Recovery Forum to help them in assessing the priorities for funding the sector in its entirety. A spokesperson said: “We are currently working at pace to develop our plans to ensure the future viability and resilience of the sector. These will be published as soon as possible. “The Arts Council NI currently have open funding programmes for both inidual artists and organisations. “Theatres have been provided with an indicative date for opening of  July. It is, however, recognised that it will be some time before venues such as theatres can operate as normal.” “There are a number of reasons for this. A number of venues have indicated that it will not be economically viable to open while social distancing remains in place. “We also need to consider the additional requirements for live performances including social distancing back stage and on stage, singing and wind instruments etc. “The Arts Council also are working with the sector to develop specic guidance for reopening theatres. This should be released shortly.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dara McNicholl, from Moneyneena, wowed the judges with a stirring rendition of Whitney Houston’s ‘I Have Nothing’. The Moneyneena native made his singing bow in a school play, but his modesty meant his teacher had to ring and let his parents know. “I’ve only really been singing properly for about three years,” he told viewers in the run-up to his performance. ”I just used to hum, but secretly I’d go out into the car and sing along to the radio. Getting on the stage and looking at the amount of people staring at you is much dferent to being in the car. googletag.cmd.push ”Hopefully I have what it takes to make one of the coaches turn around.”  Dara’s parents, Donna and Chris watch on proudly from the wings. In the end, proud parents Donna and Chris watched from the wings with host Emma Willis as all four judges stood up and took notice. Will. I. Am and Danny Jones spun in their seats immediately and it didn’t take long for Paloma Faith and Pixie Lott to follow suit. “You didn’t miss a note, it was crystal-clear. I was blown away by your voice and it gave me goosebumps,” said Paloma Faith afterwards. “I’m actually lost for words, because I feel like I’m in the presence of something really special. I don’t think you realise how good you are,” added Danny Jones. googletag.cmd.push Producer Will.I.Am told Dara he hoped to bring out the best in his abilities, while Pixie Lott said she like the idea of instilling confidence in him as the show progressed. In the end, the St Colm’s Ballinascreen U hurler opted for Team Paloma to take him forward in the competition.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Greyhound tells the story of aUS NavyCommander on his first war-time assignment in command of a group of vessels defending a merchant ship convoy crossing the Atlantic. The convoys destination is Liverpool, a city which also played a key role in the war. The film was released this week on Apple TV and Derry gets a number of mentions in it. This is being seen as recognition of the importance of Derry to the allied forces during the war. Its importance increased massively after the US entered the conflict. googletag.cmd.push As Derry was the first major port in Europe for ships travelling from America, it was seen as a vital location. Thousands of US soldiers were based in Derry during the war, living in several camps built in the city. During World War , Germany deployed a large number of submarines into the Atlantic to disrupt convoys of supply ships travelling between the US and Britain. Although the US convoys were protected by shore-based military aircraft when sailing near the shore, most of the voyage was in theMid-Atlantic area, known as the Black Pit beyond the range of Allied air support, where the only protection for the convoy were the assigned naval escorts. googletag.cmd.push In Greyhound, Tom Hankss character, CommanderErnest Krause, is in charge of the operation to escort a convoy of  Allied ships headed toLiverpool. The films focus alternates between the combat between the escorts and U-boats. Greyhoundwas initially scheduled to be released in cinemas in June but was delayed due to theCOVID- pandemic. The distribution rights were then sold toApple TV which released the film digitally last weekend.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In a statement, they said: Testing and contact tracing is being conducted to identy people who may be potentially affected to help prevent any further spread. With lockdown restrictions being eased this type of occurrence is to be expected, which is why the Test, Trace and Protect programme is in place. At present anyone who tests positive for COVID- in Northern Ireland will be contacted by the contact tracing team to be given advice on what to do about managing symptoms and of the need to self-isolate to prevent any wider spread of the virus. googletag.cmd.push They will also be asked who they have been in contact with so that we can follow up with those iniduals to give them advice to help prevent the further spread of infection. Contact tracing is an established method to help prevent the further spread of infections such as COVID-, and we are using this approach to target potential clusters which could spark new outbreaks. Limavady councillor, James McCorkell, appealed for people not to panic, and to co-operate with the contact tracing teamthey are contacted. This highlights the fact that we are by no means over this troubling time and people must take this serious when out and about, he said. googletag.cmd.push I would ask that people dont panic - the Test Trace  Protect system is there to help identy these pockets that will inevitably flare up whilst we continue to go through this pandemic. I would appeal for people to cooperate with the Contact Tracing Team, should they be contacted, as this will help get any clusters under control on the area. Please also ensure you know the symptoms of covid- and take every precaution when out and about to social distance and follow at the guidance the Government has asked us to follow. If the team identies a potential cluster or outbreak this will be reported through the PHA’s normal outbreak management channels and the appropriate infection control advice actions carried out. PHA will continue to monitor all cases of COVID-, look for trends and linked cases and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. We will not comment on inidual cases as this could lead to people being identied and deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested. We would ask everyone to be mindful of this risk. This virus has the potential to make its presence felt in any district. Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in their neighbourhood right now. That’s why following the public health advice on regular hand washing and maintaining a social distance of two metres remains vitally important.

One of the most familiar faces in youth football in Derry, McLaughlin has seen it all and done it all since taking the reins at the club in the early s, and in his time there has, with the help of others, elevated Celtics standing in the town to considerable heights. Yet with his partner Aisling, children Niamh , Cara , Caolan , Aaronand Rionato look out for, a degree in Community Youth Work and a job with Hillcrest Trust, Eamons plate is more than full. googletag.cmd.push The recent th anniversary celebrations of the club, plus the Covid- lockdown, gave the -year old plenty of time to reflect on both his past, and his future. So it was that McLaughlin took to Facebook earlier this week to announce his retirement, prompting hundreds of messages of support and congratulations. “It was a really dficult decision,” he admitted. “The timing however has been right for me and my family and the club. “I have been involved for  years and we have never been in a healthier position. We have more coaches than we have ever had, I think around  or  and in the last months, we have put a new committee in place, so we are in a really strong position. With that I felt the time was right for me.” googletag.cmd.push Its all a far cry from the day when he was thrust into the top position at the club, just  years of age and with little experience of coaching. “We were in the middle of a season and we had three or four matches in the league and we still had a cup run,” he recalled. “I was  years of age and I was helping Mousey Gallagher out and when he stepped away I was thrown into the deep end because there was no-one  there. “We kept it going and the likes of Oxy and Damien Doherty gave me a hand to fulfil the fixtures. We actually reached a cup final that season, but we were beaten - by Ashfield in the Brandywell. It was a brilliant season – I was hanging around with the boys as well as managing them – boys like Ryan Coyle, Eamon Morrow and Colm Fleming and a lot of those boys are now back coaching at the club, so its gone full circle for a lot of those boys as well as myself. There are so many sides to running a successful football club – but at its heart is the development of youngsters, on and off the pitch, and it is here especially where Top of the Hill has excelled according to McLaughlin. “The talent in Derry is unbelievable and thats one of the reasons I have always stuck by it,” he continued. “Its been great to see. Top of the Hill came in  years ago, but clubs like Oxford, Trojans and Don Boscos were already established. The talent is out there. For me, hand on heart, I got as much enjoyment from seeing a young fella who never got a kick as I do as someone lting a cup. Its about development. “Were slightly dferent to most clubs - because were living on the Interface, its more than about football. Im a youth worker as well so Ive always tried to tie the two in together. At this time of year we would have had trips and interventions to keep young people off the streets and away from rioting. “I got a text the other day from a young fella in Claudy saying that, more than football, he missed the trips we would do through The Whistle and Hillcrest. Its brilliant to hear that its not just about football because there are only so many young fellas who will make it as footballers. Its the community spirit and its the family atmosphere and I hope that continues on. Thats a big thing for me.” Celtic have had their share of big names come through their ranks in McLaughlins time – Rory Holden , Josh Daniels, Michael McCrudden and Darren McCauley some of those to build careers in the game.  Current Derry City midfielder Jack Malone also has his roots in Top of the Hill and McLaughlin admits that seeing a player reach his potential is the best kind of reward. It was in fact, McCruddens transfer to Newcastle United  years ago, coinciding with the tragic death of friend and fellow coach Keith Roddy, which lit a fire in McLaughlin. “Michael, at  or , was the first ever Top of the Hill Celtic player to go across the water,” he explained. “At the same time, in , Mickeys mentor, Keith Oxy Roddyhad died, and at that point I made the conscious decision that Im grabbing this by the horns and take the club where it needs to be, with the help of the likes of Paddy Logue, Higgs, Gerard Dunlop and boys like that.  “There were a very small amount of coaches but we had teams at every age group. You were out five or six nights a week. In the last two or three years, that has changed because now we have two or three coaches at every age group. I dont know for the le of me how Jon Clford and boys like that did it on their own. They deserve every credit that they get. “When I was starting out, boys like Jon Clford and Noel Crampsey, thats the boys you spoke to and asked advice of. Even though they were your competitors on the pitch, they wrere all in it for the same reasons, and they guided me, but no-one more so than Mickey Hutton in the DD. Any problems that I had ever with football, he was at the end of the phone, and the support that the DD have given us as a club hasnt gone unnoticed over here.”  is the first year that the Foyle Cup has not run in the city since its inception in , and while it is a loss for every club throughout the city, McLaughlin cannot wait for its– with the tournament holding a special place in the Top of the Hill calendar. “We try to get at least one team in every age grouppossible,” he said. “Some teams arent great, some are better than others, but they still get the opportunity to play in the Foyle Cup, and that, for me, is amazing. If youre winning - or getting beat -, your family are there supporting you during the Foiyle Cup, savouring the atmosphere and meeting new people. The buzz about the whole city throughout the week is phenomenal.” His time with Top of the Hill, for now, has reached an end, but the green and white will remain in his blood, and when football s, he will likely be the first on the sidelines cheering on his team. “Top of the Hill has been my le for  years, without a shadow of a doubt,” he stated.  “Its meant absolutely everything and will continue to mean everything to me. “It has given me some amazing memories and it will always be one of the proudest things that Ive done in my le. “Without the help and support of so many people – even the likes of my mother and sister, it all runs in their veins. Seeing the club celebrate its th anniversary last year probably sparked off my thinking that maybe it was time to move this on. The Covid thing gave me time to reflect and think – we are in a healthy spot at the minute and we need to have every faith in the boys who are going to take up the baton and run with it. “The amount of coaches we have now is credit to where people see us. You mightnt be as big a club as Tristar or Oxford, but were well up there. The respect that Top of the Hill Celtic has throughout the city is phenomenal.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In the cargo hold, mess halls and exercise areas were also added.Entering service near the end of the war, the Georgetown Victory and  other Victory troopships were given the task of transporting the troops home as part of Operation Magic Carpet. The vessel was operated by the American Export Lines.The ship departed Sydney with , troops steaming to Glasgow, stopping for water and fuel at Fremantle in Australia, Colombo in Sri Lanka and Aden in Yemen via the Suez Canal.On April , , just before midnight, the ship ran aground hard, at near top speed,  yards south of Killard Point.All of the servicemen aboard were rescued by leboats and breeches buoy to a tug started at about am.William said local people can remember some men wading ashore through heavy fuel oil from the stricken vessel to be cared for in nearby homes.

They bind communities together, mitigate against isolation and provide something close to an essential service. It is unthinkable that they would be allowed to collapse.Mr OrsquoToole, who is a former Downing Street press officer, says he also favours a tax on the internet giants.ldquoA number of months ago, I wrote to the Executive to ask them to initiate work on my action plan, which includes a rates holiday for local newspapers, prioritising local media in advertising spend, committing to a poundm journalism fund and to press the British Government to institute a digital information levy on social media giants such as Facebook and Google, he said.The MLA added: ldquoI welcomed the opportunity to engage with the finance minister where I pressed upon him the importance of committing to act to save this vital industry.

We had the most beautul Art Deco Vaudeville theatre for celebrities, actors and directors to view their work. So I always loved it and knew I wanted to create something like that when it came todesigning the cinema, explained Jacqueline.Jacqueline reeled in her professional interior design skills, repurposing household items and getting inspiration from the dance showrsquos judgesrsquo table for her home cinema.She said: ldquoTony and I moved back home from London and built our home where we had a basement constructed. But it became a storage area and the kids were sitting more or less in the middle of it.ldquoWe drove up to Belfast and got wadding to line the walls. When we ran out of wadding, we just used old duvets. We covered the wadding with red velvet. That made the room soundproof.ldquoWe are cocooned watching a movie and a massive thunder storm would pass without us even hearing it. Tony did the building work by and the kids helped. We called them the film crew.ldquoI also got gold paint and mixed that with glitter to give the old-style feel of the movie room. We made a bar thatrsquos inspired by the judgesrsquo  table on Strictly Come Dancing. I was watching the show one night and thought Irsquod like to make something like that.The Art Deco-style columns were Billy bookcases from Ikea that we painted. I had a mirror bought for me that needed a place to hang it and we put that in the bar where it really suits. A relative bought us a popcorn machine for added authenticity.She said that from creating the mood board for the project to when it was completed took four weeks, but it really was not used until lockdown.ldquoBefore the Covid- restrictions, the cinema was something we had started and used a bit. When lockdown came and the cinemas closed, the kids were never out of our cinema, she said.ldquoThe kids can go in there and watch their Netflix and Disney Plus mdash we have Sky, Netflix and every other movie and plus channel going now during lockdown so we can get the newly released movies as they are streamed.ldquoNow therersquos so much satisfaction with it.

He was a principled man who helped everyone, regardless of their politics and always stood up for what he believed to be right.A passionate defender of the Ballynahinch electoral area, he lobbied hard to secure investment and was a key player in the drive to secure a new bypass around the market town.Mr Toman made a signicant contribution to the district and a number of organisations, including Loughinisland GAC. He was the clubrsquos former cultural officer and treasurer.Leading the tributes to her friend and former council colleague, Lady Ritchie said the community of Loughinisland and further afield had lost a man of ldquoimmeasurable integrity and the epitome of hard work and resilience.

I can recall Patsy working in that shop and sometimes he delivered our groceries, she recalled.ldquoIn our many conversations, he recalled those visits and how I was only ever interested in the lemonade bottles that were in the grocery box. At that early stage of his le, Patsy was in a hurry and, above all, he was super efficient to get the job done. His attention to detail was legendary.Lady Ritchie said that she next met Mr Toman at a meeting of the SDLPrsquos Down District Executive in Dundrum in June .ldquoPatsy obviously knew who I was because he asked meI was still in Belfast.

He was a member of Ballynahinch Credit Union, Magherlegan Pipe Band, the Monday Club in Drumaness and Loughinisland GAC, as well as numerous organisations associated with the former Down Council. Patsy was a true Gael and was involved in the cultural and Scor activities of his home club.ldquoWhen I worked with the late Eddie McGrady MP, Patsy used to call into the Downpatrick constituency office every Monday and would have met up with the late Cllr Peter Craig.ldquoThere was fierce rivalry between the Saul and Loughinisland GAA teams and those matches were fought out again in the Scotch Street office and latterly in Saul Street, with Patsy and Peter also glorying in the fortunes of the Down GAA team in the early s.Lady Ritchie said Mr Toman always put the needs of people first, with this clearly reflected in the background work he did on behalf of the Loughinisland families following the  massacre at The Heights Bar in the village.ldquoPatsy was shaken with emotion and grief about the killing of six innocent men and the images of that night on June  lasted with him until he was overtaken by his illness and his untimely death. He always stood solidly with the families in their fight for justice and truth, she continued.Lady Ritchie said Mr Toman was involved in the politics of the SDLP for a long time and was a founder member and chairman of the partyrsquos Drumaness branch.He was elected to Down Council in  and subsequently re-elected in , , ,  and  and while he retired from elected politics in , he remained active in the community.ldquoPatsy was a stalwart on the East Border Region Committee and the Ards Down Rural Partnership, continued Lady Ritchie.ldquoI fought many elections with him and he kept driving everyone to go the extra mile to achieve better representation. AndPatsy had an issue that required a resolution, he pursued you until he got an answer, applying that same approach for all of his constituents.Lady Ritchie said Mr Toman had been a ldquotrue, loyal friend for many years and was delighted and honoured to attend his th birthday celebrations in April of last year.ldquoPatsy always confronted you with his political problems which were not major at all. Such was the loyalty and bond between Patsy and myself that whenever I was ill with breast cancer, both he and his we Anne arranged a special Mass for me the day before my surgery. I will never forget that and I am eternally grateful to Patsy and Anne for their personal support to me during my political and personal le, she added.She added: ldquoPatsy was an extremely loyal inidual a family man who cherished his we, children and grandchildren.

In Wales they are not compulsory in shops instead, the government there says its medical advice is to support “the public’s right to choose” .If people do decide to wear face coverings, it says these “should be made up of three layers, as set out by the World Health Organisation”.In the Republic of Ireland, on Wednesday the new taoiseach announced that face coverings must now be worn in all shops, retail settings and shopping centres.There are already legal regulations requiring the mandatory wearing of masks on public transport in the Republic , and the taoiseach Micheal Martin said that now “regulations with details on enforcement and penalties will be formulated” in relation to masks in shops.Speaking yesterday, when she met Mr Martin while he visited Belfast, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The chief medical officerhas made it very clear that while perhaps at one stage of this pandemic he was not convinced of the merits of face coverings, we are now in a space where he thinks that is the case.“We will look at all of that evidence and then make a decision on that. But I think that as more and more people are moving around as we come to the end of the shielding period, there is probably a logical reason as to why face coverings should be a thing that we are all .”Briefing the media separately from Arlene Foster,she added that Northern Ireland’s policies needed to be aligned with the Republic’s, and that the jurisdictions’ chief medical officers were working closely together.According to the Department of Health, the total number of Covid- deaths recorded as of yesterday in Northern Ireland was .The frequency has slowed markedly from a peak on April to now, when it has become increasingly routine to have no deaths reported each day, ever since the first death-free day on June .A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...What is going on at the top of the DUP is particularly intriguing because one of the architects of St Andrews – Mrs Foster’s former senior special adviser Richard Bullick – has now said that this bill represents “the most signicant rolling back of the St Andrews Agreement and will signicantly undermine the ability of the Executive to prevent ministers acting without collective agreement”.After months in which the Executive has been almost wholly focussed on dealing with the pandemic, there has been little legislation brought to the legislature.But on July , Mrs Foster and Ms O’Neill appeared before the Assembly committee which scrutinises their department to reveal aspects of the bill and to ask that it be fast-tracked by accelerated passage, thus limiting scrutiny.However, the previous day had seen Ms O’Neill and myriad Sinn Féin colleagues openly breach her own public health advice, meaning that discussion of the legislation essentially became an appetiser to the main course of Ms O’Neill having to publicly account for her actions.With Mrs Foster describing it as “a very short bill” which was “literally a one-clause bill when you look at the substantive nature of the piece of legislation”, neither the First Minister’s words nor her body language suggested this was highly signicant.She said it was necessary because of the Court of Appeal ruling in  – the Buick case – in which judges ruled against civil servants giving planning permission for a huge incinerator in the absence of a minister.One of the court’s reasons for ruling as it did was that it said the issue involved more than one minister’s responsibilities – a so-called ‘cross-cutting issue’ which has to be referred to the Executive as a whole.Mrs Foster told MLAs that the bill would clary that issue because otherwise the Executive could find itself having to take planning decisions, despite not being best placed to do so.But for some reason the bill goes far further and redefines the meaning of cross-cutting for all ministerial decisions.The First Minister indicated that she understood the bill’s sweeping nature, saying that “we wanted to deal with it right across government, and not just in terms of the Department for Infrastructure”.The First Minister’s argument was somewhat curious because the DUP leader was taking issue with the fact that the court had placed an expansive interpretation on the term ‘cross-cutting’. That means that there are a large number of areas in which a minister’s power to act alone is curtailed because another minister can argue that they would be impacted by their decision.What she did not say was that the court’s interpretation was essentially the DUP’s long-standing interpretation of the term – the party had for years argued for a wide definition, something which gave it more scope to have a role in other ministers’ decisions.In fact Mrs Foster had personally gone to court – on a question of planning policy – when she was Enterprise Minister in  to challenge a decision by fellow minister Mark H Durkan. Mrs Foster’s grounds of challenge were centred on precisely this area – the argument that he had exceeded his powers because it was a cross-cutting issue.For her part, Ms O’Neill said it was “really, really important that we get this bill enacted before the end of July to allow the planning minister to be able to take a number of planning decisions”.But Ms O’Neill, whose opening statement to the committee lasted less than a minute, gave even less sense that she comprehended the signicance of what she was jointly proposing.After less than  minutes of evidence and consideration, the committee acquiesced easily in the ministers’ request for accelerated passage of the bill.The committee’s SDLP chairman, Colin McGrath, said: “I think it’s fairly straightforward it’s not an overly complex bill.”In fact, theof the bill is deceptive it deals with an exceptionally complicated juncture between messy Stormont politics, statute and case law, balancing the ability of ministers to take decisions for which they are accountable against the Executive’s desire to maintain some sort of coherence rather than an administration of ministers constantly acting to thwart each other.Five days later, the issue came to the whole Assembly. Only four MLAs opposed reducing scrutiny of the bill. But just one MLA – People Before Profit’s Gerry Carroll – voted against the bill itself at second reading.Sinn Fein’s Pat Sheehan supported it as “a sensible and effective approach”, Alliance’s Andrew Muir said that the bill was “necessary” and even DUP MLAs who had enthusiastically endorsed St Andrews now queued up to say that a bill which a key DUP architect of that agreement says unravels that deal is crucial.DUP veteran Mervyn Storey said that “obviously, this is a necessary requirement”. Party colleague William Humphrey said it was “vital that we have legislation that allows Northern Ireland to go forward”. Fellow DUP MLA Christopher Stalford said “anything that makes government quicker and more reactive to the needs that confront it is only to be welcomed”.Even the Executive’s arch-critic, Jim Allister, accepted that the bill was “necessary”.But last week Mr Bullick, Mrs Foster’s former adviser and a lawyer by training, began tweeting his unhappiness at what was unfolding.He said that one provision in the bill “puts [ministers] in a much stronger position in the event of a legal challenge” and was “based on a misreading of the case law”.Central to the DUP’s thinking at St Andrews was an attempt to stop Sinn Fein ministers from going on solo runs, such as Martin McGuinness’s unilateral abolishment of the Eleven Plus in .Critics of St Andrews argued that it led to sluggish government where decisions languished untaken for months or years and Stormont’s two dominant parties carved up power in backroom deals.But the DUP was willing to accept that because it saw Sinn Féin as a party with far more radical goals than its own essentially the DUP accepted that the price of thwarting a swashbuckling republican agenda was to have lethargic centralised decision-making because it could stall or halt what it didn’t like.This bill does not wholly undo the St Andrews changes, but the very fact that Mr Bullick – the strategic brain of the DUP for years who has not spoken out publicly against the party since leaving his role three years ago – is forthrightly warning the DUP in public about this issue shows that it has caused alarm among some of those most intimately involved in constructing St Andrews.It is no surprise that Sinn Féin is endorsing something which weakens provisions designed by the DUP to curb its power.But is the DUP consciously making a major policy sht, or is a momentous decision being taken in ignorance It is possible that Mrs Foster has calculated that the inertia of the post-St Andrews decade of devolution was a mistake and that it is now better to give ministers more freedom to take speedy decisions – eventhat means Sinn Féin decisions which unionists will dislike.But Mrs Foster has nowhere made that argument or even indicated that she grasps the import of what she is doing.It is equally possible that Mrs Foster, the minister who didn’t even bother to read the legislation which she asked MLAs to vote for in  to set up the RHI scheme, is not across the detail of what is a complex area.If that is the case here, that flaw could prove enormously damaging to her own interests, even– as with RHI – this legislation sails through with scant opposition when MLAs debate it on Tuesday.——— —————— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is

while the council takes steps to mitigate further issues.A meeting with residents and the local community council was held on Tuesday, June  to explain the steps the council would be taking, in the

The specic timings for reopening may y from place to place as owners take assessments and make any necessary changes.ldquoAs we take these cautious steps, no one should make the mistake of thinking the virus has gone away. We could find our hard work quickly undone unless we all go on playing our part, every day, and in every way we can, to keep Wales safe.The Welsh Government has previously asked a number of businesses to begin preparing to reopen from July ,the conditions allow.These are as follows:bull Close contact services, including nail and beauty salons and businesses providing tanning services, massages, body piercings, tattooing, electrolysis or acupuncture.bull Indoor cinemas, museums, galleries and archive services.bull Tourist accommodation with shared facilities, such as camping sites. Opening would be from July .bull Reopening the housing market fully.Provided the reopening of these sectors goes well and conditions allow, indoor opening for pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants will resume from August , following the outcome of the next review of the coronavirus regulations. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

,  and a mammoth  litre version for higher footfall areas.They can be used outside and we are also producing bespoke ‘all ability’ models and models which include provision to store contact tracing details, order to meet the specic needs of our clients. “Working to provide solutions for our clients across the local area, from small shops to the Bouled Outlet and from churches to sports clubs we have been delighted with the feedback we have been receiving not only for our Gel-Gem’s but also for our new hand-friendly sanitising gel which we can supply wholesale. “We are also delighted that every sale of a Gel-Gem unit supports the work of charity Kidney Care UK as they support local kidney patients which highlights the need to sanitise not only for ourselves but for those who are clinically vulnerable and at higher risk of infection.”Concluding Brian Jardine said: “At The Pot Belly we are very proud of our historic roots and excited about once again welcoming our customers back to enjoy our locally sourced menu’s while at the same time taking the steps to keep everyone safe.”If you want to find out more about the Gel-Gem units visit www.d-ps gel-gem or contact Raymond at gel-gem@d-ps\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"these are  most desirable dogs breeds do you have one them ","story":"These are the  most desirable dogs breeds -
