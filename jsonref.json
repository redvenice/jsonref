We await a further indication as to whether Omicron has any ability to evade vaccine induced immunity.\u0027Infectious diseases expert at the University of East Anglia Professor Paul Hunter said: \u0027The implications of this paper are that Omicron will be able to overcome natural and probably vaccine induced immunity to a significant degree. \u0027But, the degree is still unclear though it is doubtful that this will represent complete escape.\u0027He added: \u0027It remains the case that the extra value of the booster vaccination dose remains the most important step that we can take to reduce the probability of severe disease. \u0027I suspect new targeted vaccinations will be developed against omicron but it the infection spreads globally as rapidly as it seems to be taking off in South Africa then most of us may already have had the infection by the time a new vaccine is available.\u0027Some 51,402 people in the country took a Covid test and 22.4 per cent of them tested positive for the virus. For comparison, 38,075 per cent of tests taken on the same day last week and 6.5 per cent were positive.Meanwhile, Covid hospital admissions nearly tripled in a week, but deaths have fallen 64 per cent.But despite fears about Omicron, South Africa is still recording far fewer overall Covid cases compared to its population size than both the UK and US.Figures from the Oxford University research platform Our World in Data show South Africa has 63 cases per million people compared to 638 in the UK and 257 in the US. Cases are rising sharply in South Africa but are starting at a low base.Professor Anne von Gottberg, a clinical microbiologist at the NICD, revealed at a World Health Organization conference yesterday the variant was behind 75 per cent of cases nationally and it \u0027does look like there is a predominance of Omicron throughout the country\u0027.Five of the country\u0027s nine provinces have confirmed Omicron cases and officials expect its prevalence to be high in the remaining four areas where positive samples have not yet been sequenced. There have only been 183 confirmed cases of the strain because only a handful of positive samples are analysed for variants.The variant has been spotted in more than 20 countries worldwide and is likely to have been spreading for weeks before South Africa raised the alarm. The Netherlands detected a case one week earlier, while Nigeria found its first case in a sample taken in October.It was even in the UK before it was first spotted by scientists last week, with nine cases in Scotland on November 20, causing speculation the strain was imported from the COP 26 climate conference or a rugby game at Murrayfield Stadium against South Africa.New images of the strain\u0027s 32 mutations were released yesterday by the Covid Genomics UK Consortium (COG-UK).They show the variant\u0027s three mutations — H655Y, N679K, and P681H, located in the lower right of the image — that could help the virus sneak into the body more easily. And the graphic shows a group of mutations — K417N, S477N, Q498R, E484A and N501Y — that are thought to help Omicron dodge antibodies that usually help fight off the virus.And N501Y, which was previously seen on Alpha, Beta and Gamma, also helps the virus bind to the body\u0027s cells more easily, allowing for it to enter the body and replicate more efficiently.Meanwhile, it has 26 mutations on its spike protein — that haven\u0027t been seen in previous variants and scientists are still probing whether they will have any impact on how fast it can spread."},{"url":null,"title":"Ex Premier League referee David Elleray asked black colleague coal mine","story":"Share this articleThe whistleblower, who was present at the St George\u0027s Park conference where the comments were made with some 30 officials in attendance, is remaining anonymous over fears of retribution.But the complaint has now sparked calls for an independent investigation into the incident, the governing body\u0027s handling of it and Elleray\u0027s general conduct.The 67-year-old was arguably the most well-known referee in the country at the Premier League\u0027s inception in 1992.He went on to officiate in the top flight until 2003, also taking charge of an FA Cup final and more than 70 international matches.After retiring, he was made an MBE in 2014 for services to football, at which time he was chairman of the FA\u0027s referee committee and held advisory roles at both Uefa and Fifa.Elleray - who taught for more than 30 years at Harrow School after reading geography at Oxford, earning him a reputation for being \u0027schoolmasterly\u0027 on the pitch - also currently sits on three FA committees.He chairs the referee committee, is a National Game representative for the Football Regulatory Authority and also sits on the youth participation committee. An FA spokesperson told inews: \u0027The FA investigated inappropriate comments made by David Elleray in 2014 and found that he breached the FA Council Members\u0027 code of conduct.

In South Africa, where the strain has taken hold, cases are surging more than sixfold week-on-week.UKHSA sources said there was still nothing to suggest that the variant was spreading in the community.Separate data from a surveillance study yesterday showed symptomatic Covid cases in the UK rose by nearly five per cent to more than 80,000 per day last week.The ZOE symptom-tracking study estimated that 80,483 people fell ill on any given day in the week ending November 27, based on test results from around 650,000 volunteers.It marked a rise of 4.9 per cent compared to the estimate on the previous week and means one in 61 Britons suffered a symptomatic infection at any given time, King\u0027s College London scientists who run the study said.But infections started to fall in the over-55s, in a clear sign of the effect of booster vaccine doses — with more than 19million people now having had a third dose according to Government data.No10 unveiled its new scheme to vaccinate all over-18s by the end of January on Tuesday, with the UK yesterday buying 114million more doses in an effort to stop the spread of the new supermutant Omicron variant.Professor Tim Spector, the epidemiologist behind the ZOE study, warned the Omicron variant has \u0027rudely awakened\u0027 the UK to the pandemic and encouraged more volunteers to continue tracking their symptoms to help monitor the strain.He said said: \u0027Omicron has rudely awakened many countries, including the UK, from the slumber they had fallen into over Covid.\u0027While we need more data to understand the risks this variant presents, I would advise the public not to panic, but remember that it\u0027s important for everyone to be more cautious.         ‹ Slide me ›    The above maps show percentage change in Covid cases across England in the week to November 21 (left), and November 28 (right).

A man Lawrie McMenemy memorably described as looking like a ringer for Lennie Bennett. Remember him from the 1998 World Cup? However, Jurgen Klopp says it is to work under main goalkeeping coach John Achterberg not to replace him as the Dutchman has just signed a new contract. Klopp explained: “We spoke to Ali (Brazilian Alisson Becker) and he was quite pleased. He loved the idea as well. He’s a brilliant guy. “And John Achterberg has renewed his contract by the way until 2024. He’s the head of the goalie department.”“If you have experienced blind football, perhaps the five-a-side competition that is part of the Paralympics, you will know it is mesmerising. At the top level, it is characterised by sinuous dribbling and rasping finishes. It is a game with a rhythm of its own. But to watch it, as a sighted person, gives only a partial sense of its complexity and challenges. It is a sport, its advocates insist, which offers transformative effects for those who play.” The fans are desperate for the Chelsea youth product to get extra game time, especially after watching recent performances. Lamptey gave Leeds the runaround for 75 minutes in last weekend’s 0-0 draw before being withdrawn and then came off the bench to set up Neal Maupay’s equaliser at West Ham. But with the 21-year-old right-back still coming back to full strength after a serious hamstring injury which put him out for nine months, Potter is erring on the side of caution. “We’re going through a period where we’re going to play lots of games in a short space of time so that’s the only thing that’s going to stop the regularity of Tariq,” said Potter. “We all know his qualities and what he brings to the team. It’s just the close proximity of games will challenge him and us in terms of how much he plays and when he plays.” Here’s Potter on opposite number Ralph Hasenhüttl ahead of the south-coast derby against Southampton. “I like Southampton, I like what they do as there is real clarity there. You can see what they’re trying to do, they’re really impressive in the build-up and how they get into the final third. “I am sure they will get better and better as they adjust to each other, with Danny Ings moving on, the identity of how they defend and press is really good. “It’s always a tough game, but another one we are looking forward to. It’s three games in a week for both teams, both have had a busy schedule.”“It’s crazy. It was always crazy and I think it will always be crazy. We have to accept that. We’ll have to dig in and fight through. Super intense.”  December has started well thanks to that 4-1 win over Everton on Wednesday although Klopp wasn’t handing out full marks when asked if it was a 910 performance. “I don’t even think it was close to an 8, to be honest. Because there was a spell where we let them back into the game. It was our best game at Goodison since I’ve been here but we want more.”  Diogo Jota scored the final goal in that Goodison romp and the Portuguese star will be hoping to continue his good form at former club Wolves on Saturday. Jota got the winner for Liverpool in this fixture last season. Klopp on Jota: “An incredible package. Really smart. Structured in a very nice way. The first time I saw him play I thought ‘this could be a player for me’. The intensity he played with.” It’s all hands on decks given the busy fixture list and Klopp says Joe Gomez and Naby Keita joined in ‘big parts’ of training yesterday even though both won’t be in the squad for the trip to Molineux. Klopp added: “They didn’t yet do the full session but they looked brilliant. They will use the next few days to do what they need to do. After this weekend they should be in contention again.”As he approaches three years in charge, the Saints boss was asked to review his time at the club. It seems some realism has set in. “You want me to give a summary of all that in one minute! “I’ve been here a long time now yes, and I knew that it would be tough. “I was coming from a Champions League club (RB Leipzig) and now I’m at a club where the main goal is to stay in the league. “It’s a survival fight every day, every week, with the limits we have with a club. But we’ve made some good progress. “Even if you sell players for a lot of money we are trying to rebuild the team, this is the way we have to go. “This was a change in my mind also, it took a little bit to understand this, to be honest. “When we were coming here we had targets of bringing the club as high in the table as possible, maybe reaching European places. “But then you see how strong the league is, you see the potential, and there’s another team coming now in Newcastle with absolutely more financial potential than we have. “But the job is not affected by this hard work, it’s still fantastic, I enjoy my job every day, and it’s fantastic to work at this club with my staff and this team. “We do the best to bring good games to the supporters, to make them proud of our team and our club.” “We’ve conceded eight goals in three games, okay four against red-hot Liverpool, but this is something I thought we had put out of our game and now it’s back on the list of things we have to solve. “Brighton have a very open-minded manager that picks the best parts of everybody’s games and brings it together. “They are one of the best organised teams and have made fantastic progress, so I have to say absolute congratulations to my opposite number there.” And how about life on the south coast? “My wife and I enjoy life here very much, it’s a wonderful place to live. I love the people, I love the respect they give to you in every part of your life here. “I really must say that from this part, there’s not that much that I miss. Okay maybe I miss the mountains of Austria, but they are not running away, they are waiting for me.” Yep, Ralph will always have the mountains.The Magpies have won precisely none of their opening 14 Premier League games of the season and that puts them in a hall of shame alongside Swindon, QPR and Sheffield United. Needless to say, none of them had the last laugh as all three were relegated. So, Eddie, are you up for a bit of miracle working? “Yes, I am. I’m realistic, but I’m also very, very positive. “I know it’s going to be extremely difficult – if no team has done it, there’s a reason why they haven’t done it. That’s because it’s incredibly tough. “But why not be the first? That’s always been my mindset. Why not change history? That’s what we’re going to have to do. “We’re going to have to do it the hard way, but we’re more than capable.” Howe has been particularly impressed with Joelinton (no, really). The Brazilian has just 11 goals in 93 appearances so far for Newcastle but has perked up in recent games. “When you watch a team from afar, you do have an opinion. I always liked him, but now, working closely with him, I like him even more,” said Howe. “You see the person and the human behind the player. What I see from him is just an incredible guy who really wants to do well. “He’s had a difficult moment, going to a new club for a big fee, but his resilience and attitude to that has been fantastic. He has had no negative reaction, only eagerness to prove his worth to the team, supporters and club. “Longer term, I really think he can do that. I see someone who can make a difference for us and is very motivated to do well.” As for team news ahead of Saturday’s home clash against Burnley, Ciaran Clark is suspended after his red card against Norwich. Jamaal Lascelles and Matt Ritchie are available again after serving bans.Bamford has been out with an ankle injury since mid-September while a knee problem has sidelined Ayling for the same period. Both came through a run-out for the Under-23s on Monday. Bielsa on Bamford: “Just to say he was a player who scored one goal every two games last season is enough to show his importance. “And even when he doesn’t score, he’s an important part of how the team functions.” Leeds are up to 15th - and just one point behind 11th - after Raphinha’s stoppage-time winner from the penalty spot against Crystal Palace on Tuesday gave them a second straight three points. “To win consecutively fortifies you,” Bielsa said. “When we focus on every game independent of who comes next, given the amount of fixtures we’ve played up until now, the points that we’ve got on the board are few and every fixture is an opportunity to balance our numbers.”  He’s also denied - in a very Bielsa way - a fallout with England midfielder Kalvin Phillips. “It’s difficult to express yourself over things that didn’t happen, that there’s nothing behind and that are expressed as a reality,” Bielsa said. “There’s things that correspond to the private part of a relationship so perhaps the media talks about these things that are hidden but this is a next step. This was the spread of something that didn’t happen at all. “The press, not only do they inform, but they have their legitimate need that what they tell wakes up interest and in that process, on occasion it happens that they invent realities to bring attention.” Leeds host Brentford this weekend but then play Chelsea and Manchester City away from home, Arsenal at Elland Road and Liverpool at Anfield.Those are the words of new manager Dean Smith who is unbeaten in three games since taking over. Add in Daniel Farke’s farewell win over Brentford and the Canaries have won two and drawn two of their last four games. Everton would kill for that sort of form. Here’s Smith on the 1-1 draw with Newcastle on Wednesday: “We look hard to beat, I can’t remember Newcastle having many chances. “We’ve felt we left some points out there. With Newcastle going down to 10 men after 10 minutes, we could have been better with the ball and we felt we should have performed a lot better. It’s a solid start and we look hard to beat.” Striker Teemu Pukki netted a superb equaliser at Newcastle but Smith says others need to ease the goalscoring burden on him. “He needs help. Looking at Teemu and speaking to him you wouldn’t know he is carrying such a weight on his shoulders. He seems a real level-headed, laid-back guy who wants to work hard for the team. “He’s one who I knew was a good player but you don’t realise how good a player until you actually work with him. His work-rate, the quality of his finishing, the quality of his runs and he sets the tempo at the top for us. “I’ve been really pleased in what we’ve got. He is setting a standard for the others to follow. But we know we can’t be over-reliant on just one goalscorer in the team. We need goals from other areas. “We’ve spoken about it, that’s why the importance of set-pieces also comes into play. If we can be a little bit more creative in those areas then we will get goals from other players. “What helps is he’s had the experience of playing in the Premier League. He’s got the experience of another season in the Championship, where he’s done really well, and he understands his own body. We help him along the way.” Pukki has five goals this season but just three other Norwich players – Mathias Normann, Andrew Omobamidele and Grant Hanley – have scored in the Premier League. “We have found a good balance in our performances this season but there is no naivety, it is one loss in eight but also one win in eight so we have to change that side of things. “You would prefer to be in a situation where you have only lost one in eight, it is a good situation mentally for the players, a reminder of the good work and they know they are not far away. “Now it is about adding in the detail to win games, we have done it many times before and now it is just about delivery.” On Eddie Howe: “I am pleased to see him back. I texted him and said I hoped it goes well, although not against us obviously. “He will still be finding his best route and best mix of players. Long term money is very beneficial, but in the short term you have to find a way to get results. Eddie will know that.” On Newcastle and the January transfer window: “Most teams hang on and hang on and push the financial margins for obvious reasons because they know they only have a certain window to do the deal. “It’s very difficult to get deals done early because everyone’s marketing each other’s players and putting their own sales pitch out. It’s not only agents by the way, the clubs do it as well and before you know it it’s on the yellow line at the bottom of Sky (Sports News). “Then of course you need a player who possibly has a reason to move. Money is obvious of course, or maybe there’s a change of manager or a falling out with the current manager. “All of these things go into it and you have a very short period to sort this out. There are a lot of people looking at each other’s players, trying to align the deal and the right deals that can matter and not get into a position where you make deals that end up not mattering and can cost a lot of money. “But maybe they (Newcastle) have got enough money to make things happen because everyone has a price in football. There are clubs I know that will just go: ‘Yeah, okay we’re going to sell’. “Newcastle might have enough money, teams have done it in the past and they might be one of them. We will have to wait and see.”While Manchester United and Arsenal try and get back to where they once belonged, I have a feeling that Antonio Conte’s Spurs could be the best bets to grab fourth place. At the other end of the table, Norwich are starting to dig it after two wins and two draws in their last four. But how many matches until Newcastle finally get a win? Maybe they’ll get one after 909. Elsewhere, Rafa’s not for you Blues following a shocking Merseybeat and Brentford fans will be hoping to dig a Toney as they set off on their long and winding trip to Elland Road. Grab some tea and toast, cancel your Disney subscription and take a look at this weekend’s Premier League fixtures in full. All times GMT. It includes the new United boss poo-pooing the idea of a January move for Borussia Dortmund’s Erling Haaland. Lady Louise Casey: “The Euro 2020 final was a potentially glorious national occasion that turned into a day of national shame. Our team of role models were in our first major final for 55 years. However they were let down by a horde of ticketless, drunken and drugged-up thugs who chose to abuse innocent, vulnerable and disabled people, as well as police officers, volunteers and Wembley staff, creating an appalling scene of disorder and coming perilously close to putting lives at risk.” Palace took four points off United last season and have won their last two Premier League games at Old Trafford so won’t lack for confidence. There’s also that pesky stat that Rangnick will want to eradicate sooner rather than later: United have conceded in 15 consecutive home games in all competitions. That’s their worst streak since 1959.Here’s United’s fixture list for the rest of December: Not a bad time to take the helm, it seems. United’s next six Premier League games are against teams who currently sit 11th, 19th, 12th, 9th, 20th and 18th in the table.“I had a conversation with Michael for more than an hour and tried to convince him, but he needed a break and I understand his decision,” said Rangnick. “I am more than happy to work with the current staff because I need their expertise on the current squad.”“Yesterday’s game was exciting for the fans but as the coach they are not the games you need every day. For me it is to minimise the coincidence factor and have control of the game.”Read Jamie Jackson’s full story here …  Rangnick is due to do his first United press conference at 9am this morning and it will be very interesting to see what he made of last night’s rollercoaster win over Arsenal. Cristiano Ronaldo, the man who supposedly cannot press, and therefore will not fit into his new interim manager’s system, passed 800 goals and was the biggest reason United prevailed over Mikel Arteta’s side. A season that promises a title race to saviour may now have a top-four battle to match.  Rafael Benítez is under serious pressure, Newcastle face another must-win game at home to Burnley, West Ham host Chelsea in the early game on Saturday and, of course, Rangnick takes charge of his first game against Crystal Palace on Sunday. We’ll have all the early team news, previews, and hear what the managers think right here.

The sixth game of world championship matches has traditionally been a contest that’s produced a decisive result. The list is long: Steinitz def Zukertort (1886), Chigorin def Steinitz (1889), Steinitz def Gunsberg (1891), Steinitz def Chigorin (1892), Lasker def Steinitz (1897), Bogoljubow def Alekhine (1929), Alekhine def Euwe (1937), Botvinnik def Bronstein (1951), Smyslov def Botvinnik (1957), Botvinnik def Smyslov (1958), Tal def Botvinnik (1960), Fischer def Spassky (1972), Korchnoi def Karpov (1981), Karpov def Kasparov (1984), Anand def Kramnik (2008), Carlsen def Anand (2013) and Carlsen def Anand (2014). And while Game 6 of the 2018 match between Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana ended in a draw, it was an 80-move, six-and-a-half-hour epic that required a miraculous fightback from the world champion to salvage a half-point.And Carlsen plays 10. Nbd2! He’s offering a pawn sacrifice in exchange for long-term initiative, same as in the first two games. “To me, this looks like a completely new concept,” says American grandmaster Fabiano Caruana on the Chess broadcast. After 6. ... c5 7. dxc5 Bxc5 8. c4, the position is one that is very unfamiliar at the top level. “I think there is some magical cutoff point where draws instead of just being normal they become a problem,” Carlsen said after Wednesday’s game. “But I don’t think we’ve crossed the Rubicon yet.” Supercomputers evaluating the moves from the opening four games had indicated it was the most accurate world title match in the event’s history and Wednesday’s fifth contest maintained that standard as the players remarkably combined for one inaccuracy between them. Regrettably for the 31-year-old challenger, the lapse (playing 20. Red1 instead of c4) was the opportunity Carlsen needed to escape from a highly uncomfortable position as black and negotiate a draw after 43 moves. “Today is basically not about him defending well but me not using all the opportunities I had,” Nepomniachtchi said. “In general I believe these games are pretty much tense and despite it’s all draws, we are trying to play reasonable chess.” For anyone just coming aboard, Carlsen, who turned 31 on Tuesday, has been at No 1 in the Fide rankings for 10 straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he dethroned Vishy Anand for the title in 2013. Nepomniachtchi, also 31, is ranked No 5, having earned his place at the table by winning the eight-man candidates tournament in April. We’re a little more than a half-hour from today’s first move, so not much longer now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40f7f7ecb8f364ec2c5939c3d2e9c135aab63671/0_155_5906_3545/master/5906.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=9965c2caa43a67bdf659b91a26240306","title":"us government shutdown funding coronavirus omicron joe biden us politics latest","story":"Last month’s jobs report provided Biden with a much-needed, and unexpected, bout of good news.

Swaminathan said that the right response was to be ready. “How worried should we be? We need to be prepared and cautious, not panic, because we’re in a different situation to a year ago,” she said. Much remains unknown about Omicron, which has been detected in more than two dozen countries as parts of Europe grapple with a wave of infections of the more familiar Delta variant. “We need to wait, lets hope it’s milder ... but it’s too early to conclude about the variant as a whole,” Swaminathan said.The country will expand the requirement to wear masks and produce a certificate to prove a person is vaccinated or has recovered from the virus, the government said. Masks will have to be worn indoors wherever a certificate obligation applies, Reuters reports. The government also reinforced its message for people to work from home, while allowing events and venues to restrict entry only to people who are vaccinated or recovered. The measures will go into effect on Monday, Dec. 6 and be effective until Jan. 24. “The Federal Council currently assesses the situation as very critical,” the government said in a statement. “The emergence of the Omicron variant also poses new challenges for pandemic response.” Three cases of the Omicron variant have already been confirmed in Switzerland, according to the Federal Office for Public Health, with persons placed in isolation and their contacts quarantined. The country of 8.7 million is also battling an increase in infections, with more than 96,000 cases confirmed in the last 14 days. Nov. 29 saw the highest number of infections since the start of the crisis, with 11,340 cases reported. Switzerland has also tightened entry restrictions, insisting travellers from 23 countries must present negative test results and quarantine for 10 days. The government said countries would be removed from the quarantine list from Dec. 4, although it would use introduce a stricter testing obligation upon entry into the country.Angelique Coetzee, the chair of the South African Medical Association, said Omicron’s ability to spread – its R number – was believed to be above 6. The R number for Delta, the dominant variant globally, is estimated to be above 5. Speaking to the BBC’s PM programme, Coetzee said: “We know currently that the virus is transmissible. According to the scientists, the R value is 6.3, I think.” However, most of the cases seen in the province so far, including by Coetzee, have been described as mild, with the majority of infections concentrated in younger patients who make up a significantly greater proportion of the country’s unvaccinated. Prof Bruce Mellado, who advises the provincial government, told the Daily Maverick that health officials had seen such a rapid increase in cases in Gauteng over the past few weeks that they had had to recalibrate their projection models. The increase was at a rate not seen before, he said, not even in the third wave, which Mellado described as a “very serious situation”. Read the full report here:  Omicron, dubbed a variant of concern by the World Health Organisation, has prompted many governments to impose curbs on travel from southern Africa. While it is still not established where Omicron first emerged, on Nov. 25 South Africa, followed by Botswana a day later, announced they had detected a new variant whose mutations were different from the dominant Delta variant.South Africa has also complained it is being punished for having identified the new variant early. “It is unnecessary and if you ask me, for lack of a better expression, irresponsible,” Masisi said of the travel curbs, speaking in an interview with CNN on Thursday evening. “The diplomats came from a number of countries ... and they passed through a number of countries to get to Botswana.” He declined to disclose their nationalities, only saying “some had been to Europe and some had been elsewhere”.  Asked if some had come from Europe into Botswana, he replied “indeed”. Botswana said last week the country was investigating certain mutations of the coronavirus that were found in four foreign nationals who were in the country on a diplomatic mission. Omicron was detected in the diplomats who travelled into country on Nov. 7 and left on Nov. 11. The country has so far reported more than 20 cases of the new variant.Presidential spokesman Batlhalefi Leagajang told Reuters on Friday that Masisi will not disclose the countries the diplomats passed through, or their countries of origin, because “the virus should never be geo-politicized.”Omicron has been reported in at least two dozen countriesThe vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna that use mRNA technology provide the biggest boost to antibody levels when given 10-12 weeks after the second dose, a new British study has found.The “COV-Boost” study was cited by British officials when they announced that Pfizer and Moderna were preferred for use in the country’s booster campaign, but the data has only been made publicly available now.The study found that six of the seven boosters examined enhanced immunity after initial vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine, while all seven increased immunity when given after two doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine.“A third dose will be effective for many of the vaccines we’ve tested and in many different combinations,” Professor Saul Faust, an immunologist at the University of Southampton and the trial’s lead, told reporters.The study, published late on Thursday, found that a full dose or half dose of Pfizer or a full dose of Moderna gave a strong boost to both antibody and T-cell levels, regardless of whether the person initially received Pfizer or AstraZeneca.“All four of the vaccination regimes most widely deployed in the UK lead to essentially the same levels of immunity and are likely to be equally effective,” said Professor Eleanor Riley, immunologist at the University of Edinburgh. She added that a policy change in booster gaps was also supported by the data.“These data support the JCVI (vaccine committee) decision earlier this week to bring forward booster doses to 3 months after the second vaccination.”When AstraZeneca, Novavax, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and Curevac were given as boosters, they increased antibody levels for either initial vaccine, albeit to a smaller degree, the study found. However, while Valneva boosted antibodies in people initially vaccinated with AstraZeneca, it did not provide a boost for Pfizer.The COV-Boost study pre-dated the spread of the emergent Omicron variant of concern, and Faust said he had shared samples with the UK Health Security Agency to generate data on Omicron.The study did however find that booster shots also helped to generate a broad T-cell response against the Beta and Delta variants, which may play a key role in longer-term protection.A separate study by Imperial College London into how initial exposure to SARS-CoV-2 shapes immune responses, also published late on Thursday, similarly found a good T-cell response to both Alpha and Delta after infection followed by vaccinationOn Thursday, the German government and heads of the federal states agreed that only those who have been vaccinated or recently recovered from Covid should be allowed in restaurants, cinemas, leisure facilities and many shops, and mooted introducing a general vaccine mandate from February. “We should have displayed this consistency in our treatment of unvaccinated people at a much earlier stage”, said Spahn, who is due to hand over his job to a successor from the new government next Wednesday. Spahn warned that the number of Covid-19 patients on intensive care wards would “significantly rise” above the 5,000 mark in the coming weeks and months. On Friday morning, 4,793 patients suffering from the disease are lying on intensive care beds at hospitals around Germany, about half of whom are intubated. Read the full report here: Despite the realistic skin colour, nobody was fooled by the silicone limb, and the man - in his 50s - was reported to local police following the incident on Thursday night in Biella, northwest Italy, AFP reports.  “The case borders on the ridiculous, if it were not for the fact we are talking about a gesture of enormous gravity,” the head of the Piedmont regional government, Albert Cirio, said in a statement on Facebook. He said such an act was “unacceptable faced with the sacrifice that our entire community has paid during the pandemic, in terms of human lives, the social and economic cost.” The fake arm incident comes ahead of a tightening of the rules Monday in Italy for people who have not yet been vaccinated against Covid-19.Sahin also said that vaccines should continue to provide protection against severe disease, despite mutations.  BioNTech and Pfizer Inc together produced one of the first vaccines against Covid-19. “This variant might be able to infect vaccinated people. We anticipate that infected people who have been vaccinated will still be protected against severe disease,” Sahin said. The BioNTech chief executive also said that mutations in the virus meant it was more likely that annual vaccinations would become likely, as is the case with seasonal flu.Around 2,000 people, including 1,600 children at the La Châtaigneraie campus of the International School of Geneva in Founex are said to have been placed in quarantine,  On Thursday, the cantonal medical services of the cantons of Geneva and Vaud (where the school is located) took a joint decision to quarantine all pupils and staff on the campus for ten days.  The two cases are linked a family being exposed to an Omicron infected person returning from a trip to South Africa. So far, only a few cases of Omicron have been identified in Switzerland and none in Geneva or Vaud until now, it is reported.

Photograph: iStockThe National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) has recommended that no more than four households should mix over the Christmas period. Nphet met on Thursday to consider advice for the Government on the latest pandemic situation, at a time when Covid-19 case numbers have stabilised at a high level and further information on the Omicron variant is being awaited. It last night sent a letter to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly which recommends a maximum of six people at a table in bars and restaurants, the closure of nightclubs and capacity for indoor events such as concerts be reduced to 50 per cent until January 9th, Proposed limits on households mixing would see the hosts permitted to welcome visitors from three others homes, with the letter stating that there will be a need for “some flexibility depending on inidual circumstances”. Nphet also recommened that the vaccination pass should be extended to “high risk” venues such as gyms and hotels “with appropriate exemptions as required”. Minister for Justice Helen McEntee said the Government would make a decision on the recommendations on Friday in order to prevent “speculation over the weekend”. She said Ministers had met Nphet members and other officials at 11am ahead of a full Cabinet meeting, which is due to take place at 3pm. “We as a Government want to move as quickly as possible and respond to any recommendations that Nphet may have made,” she said, adding that she did not want to cause confusion or worry for people. Ms McEntee said that while infections numbers were high – an average of some 4,450 cases a day have been recorded in the last week – the country was in a “different place” than at this time last year. The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 has fallen by 17 in the last 24 hours to 528 and is down by a more than one fifth on the recent high of 685 recorded on November 22nd. Hospitality sectorTaoiseach Micheál Martin and Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath on Friday met representatives of the hospitality industry, who raised concerns about the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) being cut earlier this week. The Restaurants Association of Ireland (RAI) said the meeting, which heard calls for a comprehensive support package for the sector, was “positive and constructive”. “While no decision was made at the meeting, Government has confirmed that hospitality businesses will be supported over the next number weeks due to recognition that business has substantially declined,” RAI chief executive Adrian Cummins said, adding that hospitality representatives had asked the Government to establish a long-term plan for the viability of the sectoPadraig Cribben, chief executive of the Vintners’ Federation of Ireland, said he believed “those at the top of Government” understood their concerns and that he would expect any announcements by the Government on Nphet advice to be “accompanied by some supports for the sector”.The VFI said the Taoiseach said he understood that public health messaging asking people to avoid socialising was having a hugely detrimental impact on the trade in what should be the busiest period of the year for pubs.Testing for travellersSeparately, the Government has notified airlines that the introduction of a system of PCR and antigen testing for passengers arriving into Ireland has been delayed by 48 hours.The measure was due to come into force on Friday, but Aer Lingus said airlines had been informed on Thursday night that the regulations would now begin on Sunday. All arrivals into the State - whether vaccinated or not - will need a negative Covid-19 test result from then onwards.Those travelling with an antigen test result will need to have obtained it within 48 hours of arrival into Ireland, and it will have to be a professionally administered test. Those with a PCR test result will have a longer pre-travel window of 72 hours. Earlier, Maynooth University professor of immunology Paul Moynagh said the latest restrictions reportedly proposed by Nphet could lead to some benefits but seem ed “random and arbitrary”.He told Newstalk Breakfast that “big mistakes” have been made with regard to messaging to the public.“Back in September contact tracing was stood down the reason being that children were missing too much school. But we had the option of keeping contact tracing and using antigen testing. And there has been a resistance over the last year from Nphet in terms of using antigen testing,” he said.“We saw over the last number of days the reluctance of Nphet again to impress advice from experts in the area of ventilation and air filtration. There seems to be this reluctance to accept scientific advice from outside.”Prof Moynagh said there was a need to look at this reluctance and “learn from our mistakes”.“Whereas at the moment it seems that mistakes are made and that narrative is defended. And again we end up now with new restrictions that I am not convinced are going to be very impactful,” he said.

Photograph: Alan BetsonPeople in Ireland are living in the dying days of partition, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has told an audience in the United States.In an address to the New York Bar Association about Brexit on Thursday, Ms McDonald said it was very encouraging that the US continued to be so engaged with Ireland and understood that “the Good Friday Agreement was never the final destination in the journey that we are on”.In a presentation, where she received two standing ovations, she said the agreement would outlast British prime minister Boris Johnson.She forecast that there would be a vote on Irish unification in five to 10 years and maintained discussion and preparation must take place in the meantime on issues such as infrastructure, healthcare, housing, economic policy and taxation arrangements that would apply in the future if the votes were carried.Ms McDonald said she did not accept and would challenge any assertion that a move towards Irish unity would lead to violence. She said the Government and the Taoiseach “must move from being bystanders to persuaders for unity”.As part of a wide ranging address she defended the Sinn Féin policy of MPs not taking seats at Westminster and argued that even if this policy had been dropped there would not have been sufficient numbers to stop Brexit.She also supported the introduction of an Irish language Act in Northern Ireland and strongly opposed moves by the British government to introduce an amnesty in troubles-related cases in Northern Ireland.HankeringMs McDonald said Brexit was the outworking of Britain in denial. She described it as “a product of narrow English nationalism and a hankering for the days of Empire”.“In 1962 then US secretary of state Dean Acheson reflected that ‘Great Britain lost an empire and has yet to find it’s role’. His words resonate to this day,” she said. “Britain has lost its empire and Ireland, our peace agreements and prosperity are under threat because the current British government still fails to acknowledge that fundamental fact.”The Sinn Féin leader said the Tory government in London had dragged Northern Ireland out of the EU against the democratic vote of the people.“Now Britain wishes to use Ireland as a bargaining chip, and ramp-ups interference and disruption in the north as a tactic in its confrontation with the EU,” she said. “Britain’s empire is gone but its legacy remains. We live with it in Ireland. Its scars the lives of many in our society.”Pathway to unityMs McDonald said the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement provided a peaceful and democratic pathway to Irish unity.“The Good Friday agreement was never the end point, it was never a final constitutional settlement. It is a framework, a set of rules for managing political differences today and tomorrow,” she said“It asserts the primacy of politics over conflict. The rights of all over the interests of the few. That is why agreements made must be delivered. Anything less undermines the political process.“That is why the voice of the US is so important. When Washington talks, Westminster listens. President (Joe) Biden made this crystal clear when he issued a formal diplomatic rebuke to Britain for failing to honour their agreement.”Asked from the audience about issues such as the tricolour flag and the national anthem in a future Ireland, she said these would form part of the overall discussion."},{"url":null,"title":"omicron variant what south african medics are saying","story":"Vaccinations for Covid-19 are administered at  the Parkhurst Recreation Centre in Johannesburg, South Africa, on Thursday. Photograph: Joao SilvaNew York TimesThe panicked reaction across much of the world to the Omicron variant comes with a scramble for information. In South Africa, the country where Omicron was first identified and where cases are jumping, scientists and doctors describe what they are seeing. Here are highlights from several interviews and a briefing.Marc Mendelson, the head of infectious diseases at the University of Cape Town, who also works at Groote Schuur Hospital, where the world’s first heart transplant took place:* “Anecdotally, we are seeing a lot of reinfections. What we don’t know at the moment, because we haven’t got the data yet, is how many of those people are unvaccinated versus the vaccinated.”* “While people are freaking out, the other thing to stress is that if you look across the variants, the vaccines have protected against severe disease, hospitalisation and death. And really, looking at the Omicron mutations, though there are an awful lot of them, there’s nothing really to indicate that the ability of vaccines to fight this is going to be affected to a very great extent.”* “In truth, it doesn’t want to kill you, it wants you to stick around.”* “The only ones putting their hand on their hearts and telling the world don’t worry, this is going to be mild, haven’t learned enough humility yet in the face of this virus.”* “It’s always nice to hope, but don’t set everything on this because I think your hopes could be dashed.”Richard Friedland, chief executive officer of Netcare Ltd, which operates the largest private healthcare network in South Africa:* “If in the second and third wave we’d seen these levels of positivity to tests conducted, we would have seen very significant increases in hospital admissions and we’re not seeing that. In our primary care clinics it is mainly people under 30 years old.”* “So I actually think there is a silver lining here and this may signal the end of Covid-19, with it attenuating itself to such an extent that it’s highly contagious, but doesn’t cause severe disease. That’s what happened with Spanish flu.”* “We are seeing breakthrough infections of people who have been vaccinated, but the infections we’re seeing are very mild to moderate. So for health care workers who have had boosters, it’s mostly mild. I think this whole thing has been so poorly communicated and so much panic generated.”* “It’s early days, but I’m less panicked. It feels different to me on the ground.”Shabir Madhi, a vaccinologist from the University of the Witwatersrand, who led trials of both AstraZeneca Plc’s and Novavax Inc’s shots in South Africa:* “Omicron seems to be moving at a faster speed than Delta, but at the same time what seems to be happening is that our hospitalisation rate is somewhat more muted.”* “Vaccine or past transmission create T-cell immunity, which are good at protecting against severe disease and death. The mutations of the virus very likely make it more successful against antibody activities, but it seems like there may well be preservation of the T-cell immunity.”* “I’m optimistic that in this resurgence, while the total number of cases will probably be greater, hospitalisations and deaths will be lower than what we experienced during the course of any of the first three waves. And that is, because right now in South Africa, all indications are that 75 per cent to 80 per cent of people were infected with the virus during the course of the first three waves. That is probably going to equip those iniduals – not to resist infection – but rather prevent progression of infection to severe disease.”Anne von Gottberg, a clinical microbiologist at South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases:* “All the data has shown that children have a less severe clinical course and we’ve had some anecdotal reports from hospitals in South Africa, that yes, they are seeing a few more children in some of the hospitals and are admitting them, but many of them have an uncomplicated clinical course during the few days that they are in hospital.”* “We monitored reinfections for the Beta and the Delta waves and we didn’t see an increase in reinfections over and above what we expect when the force of infection changes, when a wave starts. With Omicron, we are seeing an increase in reinfections.”* “This virus may be similar to Delta in its ability to spread or in being contagious. However, it’s the susceptibility of the population that is greater now because previous infection used to protect against Delta and now, with Omicron, it doesn’t seem to be the case.”* “However, we believe that with the reinfections the disease will be less severe and the same would hold for those that are vaccinated. So that would be good news.”Adrian Puren, acting executive director of the National Institute For Communicable Diseases of South Africa:* “While there are large numbers of cases and evidence of increased hospitalisations, large-scale sequencing would show if this variant is starting to fully displace the Delta variant. Current evidence shows that Omicron accounts for about 75 per cent of the variants in circulation overall.”* “If it does displace the Delta variant, we’d need to see if this is the result of immune evasion or because of increased transmissibility.”* “We had the Beta variant, which was more about immune evasion and we had the Delta, which was more about increased transmissibility. But reinfection data shows that transmissibility is a major contributor, so we are still trying to see if Omicron fits more into immune evasion primarily or more into increased transmission or both. Reinfection data points to immune evasion.”Leon Geffen, a general practitioner in Cape Town’s Sea Point suburb and director of the Samson Institute for Ageing Research:* “We are seeing a massive upsurge in the total number of cases,” he said. “People are mostly presenting with coughs and upper respiratory tract infections.”* “Most people I have seen or spoken to have been vaccinated.”Anthony Smith, a general practitioner in Cape Town:* “It was like a tap being turned on from Thursday or Friday last week. It’s been mostly young people, but there have been some older people, probably around 20 per cent.”* “Most of the kids have got it at communal events. They are from a younger demographic and presenting with milder symptoms, mainly sore throats and respiratory phenomenon. But, even in older people, it’s been relatively mild.”* “No-one has been even close to being seriously ill. But it’s probably too early to tell if this will be a milder variant.” – Bloomberg Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Oil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaints"},{"url":null,"title":"cabinet office complacency blamed honours recipients addresses","story":"The glitch that saw the home addresses of honours recipients leaked was identified by the Cabinet Office a week before the incident, a report has found.Celebrities such as Sir Elton John, Gabby Logan and Ainsley Harriot Senior - as well as counter-terrorism police officers - were among more than 1,000 people to have their details exposed in the 2019 breach.The privacy watchdog, the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office (ICO), criticised the Cabinet Office’s “complacency” in handling the sensitive information, fining it £500,000 for the leak.A report found that the civil servants initially spotted that recipients addresses had been erroneously included in the public file eight days before it was published on December 27, 2019.Although staff in the department\u0027s Honours and Appointments Secretariat flagged the error on December 19, it was decided to try to hide the addresses rather than redo the report, as it was close to publication.The fact the addresses were visible were flagged again on December 24. However, they were again not successfully removed from the file. The report said that neither the press office nor digital teams then checked the files before publishing on December 24, as the email that sent the file said the formatting issues had been resolved.However, the addresses were then made visible to the public for almost two and a half hours on the Gov.uk website, where they were viewed more than 3,800 times.Steve Eckersley, director of investigations at the ICO, said: “The Cabinet Office’s complacency and failure to mitigate the risk of a data breach meant that hundreds of people were potentially exposed to the risk of identity fraud and threats to their personal safety.”Following the fine, the Cabinet Office said it had implemented “a number of measures” to prevent future breaches.A spokesman said: “The Cabinet Office would like to reiterate our apology for this incident. “We took action to mitigate any potential harm by immediately informing the Information Commissioner and everyone affected by the breach.”More from NewsCovid latest news: European diplomats to blame for omicron spread, says BotswanaOld Bexley and Sidcup by-election latest: Tories fear time is running out to shore up next test in North ShropshireDuke of Cambridge joins forces with Apple for audio episode to get people walking outdoorsTravel news latest: US confirms stricter testing policy for all overseas arrivalsMeghan\u0026#39s win brings us perilously close to \u0026#39rule by judges\u0026#39Arthur Labinjo-Hughes: Emma Tustin sentenced to life and Thomas Hughes 21 years for torturing and killing six-year-oldMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"europes omicron panic has left continent dark place","story":"It may be tempting fate to say it, but Britain is perhaps the best place in Europe to spend this Christmas. Bavaria’s winter markets have closed, France’s bistros won’t let anyone in without a pass sanitaire, Belgium has banned private parties and Ireland’s pubs are all under curfew. But in Britain, the vaccinated and the unvaccinated can walk, work, eat and drink where they like. Unless the omicron variant changes everything, we may well see in the New Year having overcome the virus and upheld the basic values of liberty.Things are rather different in Germany, where hospitals are filling up and the government is planning to lock down the unvaccinated. Olaf Scholz, the incoming chancellor, favours making vaccinations compulsory and Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, is suggesting that all 27 EU members consider doing the same. Freedom should not mean freedom to infect others, runs the fairly clear argument. So it’s time for governments to take back control.This would be an easier argument if science backed it up, but studies so far make this a hard case to defend. Vaccines offer strong protection against serious illness but no guarantee against either acquiring the virus or passing it on. This makes it impossible to declare that a restaurant full of jabbed diners is “safe”. The no-jab, no-job argument also comes up against the case of the unjabbed who have had the virus. An Israeli study of 750,000 people showed that natural immunity was far stronger than vaccine-acquired immunity. So, on what grounds can someone with post-recovery immunity be fired?In France, vaccine passports have had some success in narrowing the uptake gap between young and old. But in Scotland they have proved a flop, with vaccination rates rising no faster than those in England after Nicola Sturgeon’s scheme was announced. Anyone proposing to make life harder for the unjabbed also needs to be honest about who they tend to be: ethnic minorities, the poor and the otherwise-marginalised.The unvaccinated that Angela Merkel is now squaring up against, in her final act as chancellor, are far more likely to live in her old East Germany where Alternative for Germany (AfD), the populists, are strongest. One poll found that half of unvaccinated Germans voted AfD in the recent election. This fits a trend. Across Europe, the anti-lockdown cause has tended to be picked up by Eurosceptic populists who find blunt ways of making their objections known. This has complicated the debate, with politicians often seeing the face of their political opponents in the various protests.The arrival of booster jabs makes the idea of compulsion harder still: if top-ups are needed every three to six months, how will this affect vaccine passports? Will people have to receive every top-up for the ongoing right to enjoy their liberty? Otto Schily, a minister in Gerhard Schröder’s government, yesterday pointed out that even Communist China isn’t considering mandatory vaccines. So where, he asked, will Merkel’s idea lead? Will Mr Scholz now yield to the activist lawyers advocating prison sentences for vaccine refuseniks?The politics of all this is just as isive in Italy, now in its 19th consecutive week of anti-restriction protests. Next week, it will bring in a “super green pass” where a negative test is no longer enough. Austria will start issuing fines for the unvaccinated from February, as Greece will do next month (but only for pensioners). Even Sweden, having defied the world for so long by rejecting mask-wearing and lockdowns, has now succumbed to vaccine passports. Britain is starting to look like the new Sweden: keeping calm and carrying on.Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, has flatly ruled out compulsory vaccination, seeing it as not just illiberal but counterproductive. “If you make the vaccine attractive, people will want it,” says one senior official. “If we start to threaten people, it all changes very quickly.” Right now, Britain has face masks on public transport. And non-binding advice from one minister to go easy on “snogging under the mistletoe”. And, so far, not much else.This shows Javid’s difference in style. Rather than leaping to worst-case hypotheticals, he’s keeping his eye on the data – and they show virus levels still under control. Among pensioners, vaccine uptake is 93 per cent and antibody levels are at 98 per cent: figures unlikely to be pushed much higher by restrictions. The omicron variant could put everything back to square one – and if so, there are no end of emergency buttons to press. But so far, there is no cause for alarm.Javid and others took plenty of political heat in the summer when they ended lockdown. The idea then was to face whatever Covid had in store when the health service was better able to take it – and specifically to be ready for winter. That’s why there is such reluctance to follow the rest of Europe into lockdown now. Why take the hit on the economy and the health service in anticipation of a variant that might not be so bad?Prof Philip Thomas, who predicted the third wave with modelling for Bristol University, envisages Covid steadily petering out over the next few weeks. Omicron has not (yet) changed his mind. Against this come studies – one from South Africa yesterday – saying there’s a decent chance that omicron has “substantial” ability to reinfect. It will be weeks, most likely, until anything is known for sure.Nothing is ever certain with Covid, and bumps (like yesterday’s case spike) are a reminder of how quickly things might change. Inside No 10, there are plenty of people ready to reach for vaccine passports, given half an excuse. But even Sturgeon had to give up on her plan to roll them out when the evidence showed they didn’t work. There are plenty in Government who think ending lockdown in summer did enough to “save Christmas” and don’t want it imperilled now.Last time around, Britain locked down longer and harder than anyone else in Europe. This time, Javid’s instinct is the opposite: not to jump too soon, trust the boosters and see what happens. Quite a gamble. But this time, it’s one the Government is willing to take.More from NewsOld Bexley and Sidcup by-election latest: Tories fear time is running out to shore up next test in North ShropshireDuke of Cambridge joins forces with Apple for audio episode to get people walking outdoorsCovid latest news: European diplomats to blame for omicron spread, says BotswanaTravel news latest: US confirms stricter testing policy for all overseas arrivalsMeghan\u0026#39s win brings us perilously close to \u0026#39rule by judges\u0026#39Arthur Labinjo-Hughes: Emma Tustin sentenced to life and Thomas Hughes 21 years for torturing and killing six-year-oldMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"meghans win brings us perilously close rule judges","story":"The Mail on Sunday inspires such hatred among some on the liberal-left that Meghan’s victory over the newspaper in the Court of Appeal was bound to interpreted as great triumph.Whether the same people will be cheering when the new privacy law effectively written by the earlier high court judgement is deployed to protect tax-dodgers, rogue capitalists and Tory MPs with lucrative second jobs is another matter. Much investigative journalism – and this applies as much to liberal newspapers as it does to conservative ones – relies on being able to pore over, and publish, private communications between iniduals, which were written by people who might have a reasonable expectation of them remaining private.Are we now not allowed to see Sir Geoffrey Cox’s emails, or MPs\u0027 expense claims? You can argue a public interest defence, but who now knows how a judge might interpret that? It is theoretically possible that even Meghan could find herself on the wrong end of privacy law – if, say, Prince Charles were minded to sue his own daughter in law over her disclosure that a senior member of the royal family (allegedly Charles) made a private remark speculating on the likely complexion of his grandchildren.Thursday’s verdict is no victory for truth, honesty or anything else. It simply marks another step on Britain’s long descent into kritarchy – rule by judges. It is exactly the situation which critics of the Human Rights Act warned about when it passed into law 22 years ago: given a set of vague principles to steer their decisions, judges would find themselves able to invent their own laws at whim.If we are going to have a privacy law, fine – but let’s debate it first. Let’s argue in what circumstance it should apply, whom it should protect and whom it should not, what ought to constitute a public interest defence. Let a political party put it in its manifesto and let Parliament vote on it.Instead, privacy laws are being established through the back door, by the judicial party, for whom no-one voted and which never even produced a manifesto. You don’t have to share the sentiment about judges expressed in the infamous Daily Mail headline ‘Enemies of the People’ to find this objectionable.It is fascinating, by the way, to see the  cheering the result of the Meghan case while simultaneously expressing outrage at the possibility that US Supreme Court judges might change the law on abortion without the matter being referred to democratic mandate. If you don’t like judges making up the law, then don’t praise the cases where you happen to agree with the outcome – it will come back to bite you.The High Court judgement in the Meghan was doubly offensive in that the matter was never allowed to go to a full trial – indeed, that was what the Court of Appeal ruling was all about. Summary justice is something I have always associated with dictatorships but it seems it is alive and well in Britain, too. We can have one judge, sitting on his own, without a jury and without hearing full evidence, making a ruling based on a law which he has effectively just made up himself. How ironic that we have ended up in this position as a result of an act which was supposed to respect our human rights.The Meghan case is not entirely over. The Mail on Sunday could up the stakes further and go to the Supreme Court or even the European Court of Human Rights - which remains even more supreme. But even if it were overturned and Meghan were forced to put her case before a full court the essential problem would remain.We will drift towards kritarchy for as long as the Human Rights Act allows judges to seize the legislative powers which the MPs of 2000 too freely voted to hand over. Let’s have a proper privacy law which enjoys democratic consent, respects the balance between privacy and public interest - and properly defines them too, so that everyone knows where they are.More from NewsTravel news latest: US confirms stricter testing policy for all overseas arrivalsCovid latest news: European diplomats to blame for omicron spread, says BotswanaOld Bexley and Sidcup by-election latest: Tories fear time is running out to shore up next test in North ShropshireDuke of Cambridge joins forces with Apple for audio episode to get people walking outdoorsArthur Labinjo-Hughes: Emma Tustin sentenced to life and Thomas Hughes 21 years for torturing and killing six-year-oldCold Moon 2021: what time it peaks in the UK and full moon dates for next yearMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"voters bexley sticking boris now","story":"There’s a football-related aphorism which can be deployed whenever an observer has no interest in the game’s outcome: I hope their ball bursts. In Old Bexley and Sidcup last night, everyone’s ball burst.Having said that, there can be little doubt that the Conservatives have most to celebrate from their no-score draw against their opponents. Pundits like to play the game of Wise After The Event, pontificating – after the returning officer has delivered his verdict – about how the result in any parliamentary by-election was either inevitable or predicted. In fact, the race to succeed the late MP James Brokenshire should never even have been a race, given the rock-solid status of the Tory majority there since about the time of the Norman Conquest.But by-elections in every and any circumstance are unpredictable beasts these days no inherited majority is safe when local voters are allowed the indulgence of casting a one-off vote that cannot change the government but which can shake it up a bit. This time round, voters chose to attempt neither.Perhaps “celebrate” is too strong a word for a result that saw a 19,000 majority slashed to about 4,500. But party managers will see this result as less of the indictment of Boris Johnson’s Government that they had feared and more of a half-hearted shot across the bows of a ship that few seem keen to abandon. Yet.For Labour, it was a decent result. Their share of the vote went up by about seven per cent, while the Conservative vote slumped by 13 – a result which Labour will today claim that, if replicated across the country, would see the installation of a Keir Starmer government. Except this result won’t be replicated across the country and everybody knows that. By-election results never are, and there have been some far more spectacular local results in recent years that failed to change the national political weather. Old Bexley and Sidcup won’t either.The two-party swing to Labour was uneven, which is because a few per centage points of former Tory support went to Richard Tice and his Reform UK party, which secured nearly seven per cent of the vote, securing his deposit (which is more than can be said for the Liberal Democrat candidate).Conservative Party strategists will be keeping an eye on Reform, especially after recent comments from its founder, Nigel Farage, that he might re-enter the political arena (which came as a shock to those who didn\u0027t realise he’d left it). The very existence of Reform UK, waiting in the wings for an opportunity to split the Conservative vote in a general election, is a salient reminder to Boris Johnson that invoking the spirit of Brexit, as he successfully did in 2019, will come with certain risks next time.As is often the case, the biggest winner last night was apathy. Turnout dropped by almost exactly half, a historically low level by British by-election standards. That will add to the Tories’ relief this morning: Tory voters who stayed at home can be assumed to be more determined to vote when the main event of a general election arrives.Now attention is turning to the by-election caused by Owen Paterson’s abrupt and dramatic resignation from the Commons last month after he was accused of breaking parliamentary rules on lobbying. The North Shropshire by-election will be held in just under two weeks’ time and will, on account of the circumstances, be a very different contest from the one we’ve just witnessed in Old Bexley and Sidcup.For a start, voters reputedly dislike being asked to interrupt their Thursday to vote in a  contest that could have been avoided: voting to replace a much missed and popular MP who died too young is one thing voting to replace a candidate who departed of his own volition under such a dark cloud of alleged misbehaviour presents a particular headache for the party.And it is likely that the opposition parties, which reportedly put little effort into yesterday’s contest, will see North Shropshire as a likely victory.In other words, the Conservatives’ excuses have already been neatly prepared and dusted down. The only thing more damaging to a party’s fortunes than a by-election defeat is a by-election defeat that was unexpected. North Shropshire cannot now be counted in that category.More from NewsTravel news latest: US confirms stricter testing policy for all overseas arrivalsCovid latest news: European diplomats to blame for omicron spread, says BotswanaOld Bexley and Sidcup by-election latest: Tories fear time is running out to shore up next test in North ShropshireDuke of Cambridge joins forces with Apple for audio episode to get people walking outdoorsMeghan\u0026#39s win brings us perilously close to \u0026#39rule by judges\u0026#39Arthur Labinjo-Hughes: Emma Tustin sentenced to life and Thomas Hughes 21 years for torturing and killing six-year-oldMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"confusing covid christmas advice top","story":"All the confusing Covid Christmas advice from top Tories - and what rules actually sayUK Covid rules have been changing recently - and Tory ministers claims about how to interpret them have been changing even more. Heres what the guidance says, and what MPs have added on topBoris Johnson switching on the Christmas lights in Downing Street Image: Tayfun Salci ZUMA Press Wire REX ShutterstockByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Dec | commentsYet again, you’d be forgiven for being confused about Covid rules. With the Omicron iant on the rise, the government imposed new laws on face masks and travel testing in England. But that then triggered a wave of ‘freelancing’ advice from ministers and a top official that wasn’t government policy. No has been forced to deny the Cabinet are at loggerheads amid the flurry of conflicting comments.Officially, the government’s Covid advice in England is as follows.It’s a legal requirement to wear a face maskin shops, public transport, banks and hair salons. It’s also a legal requirement for all arrivals in the UK to get a Day  PCR test and isolate until it is negative. And it’s a legal requirement to isolate for  daysyou’re a close contact of a suspected Omicron case - evenyou’re vaccinated. However, it’s not a legal requirement to cut down on gatherings or close contact, work from home, or reduce travel. Masks also aren’t a legal requirement in hospitality venues. Guidance - which is voluntary - “strongly recommends” that people wear a mask “in crowded and enclosed spaces, where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet.” Guidance also says people “may wish to take a rapid lateral flow test” for Covid in certain situations. These include on days when they’ll be “spending time in crowded and enclosed spaces, or before visiting people who are at higher risk of severe illnessthey get COVID-.” So with that out the way, what on earth have Tory ministers - and an advisor to the government - been saying  We take you through it.‘Don’t snog under the mistletoe, much’ Cabinet minister Therese Coffey said Brits should refrain from smooching strangers at Christmas. I donapost think there should be much snogging under the mistletoe,” the Work and Pensions Secretary told ITVaposs Robert Peston. Donapost need to do things like that. But I think we should all be trying to enjoy the Christmas ahead of us and thataposs why weaposre working so hard to get the deployment of as many vaccines as possible, and of course continuing to encourage people who havenapost been vaccinated at all yet, to come forward, recognising that weaposre still trying to understand the impact of Omicron.” Askedthere should be “just no snogging ”, she replied: Well, not with people you donapost already know! No said of Ms Coffey’s comments: “It is down to iniduals to use their personal judgement”. ‘Companies may cancel big Christmas parties’ Science Minister George Freeman turned into Mr Freelance when he appeared to contradict his own boss and No. He said: “For many small businesses, four or five staff working together every day anyway, gathering to have a drink isn’t a big step up in risk. “But some companies might normally bring hundreds of people around the world to a big party. “And they may decide this year ‘is that sensible ’, given the pandemic and given where we are.” Boris Johnson ’s official spokesman responded: “On Christmas parties, we don’t want people to cancel such events.“There is no government guidance to that end.  “It’s right that post Step Four weto the position were people can use their inidual judgement.” Meanwhile Mr Freeman said the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy would not be having a “big” festive bash. But his words came weeks after the Secretary of State Kwasi Kwarteng said a party was already booked. A Business Department source said “dferent teams do dferent things” and no single party for BEIS had been planned.‘Maybe take a lateral flow test, I might wear a mask’ Health Secretary Sajid Javid tracked close to the official guidance - but that only went to show how vague it is.He said there wasn’t “any need to change” Covid rules, but said he’d take a lateral flow test before going to a Christmas party. If you are invited to a Christmas party, thereaposs quite a few people there, maybe you want to take an LFT before you go,” he said. Go to the party, but just be cautious. Askedhe’d wear a mask at the party he replied: “Maybe. “It dependsI’m walking around or sitting down - it depends. If I’m eating. People just need to make a decision based on the guidance.” Mr Javid backed the Prime Minister, urging people to “follow the existing guidance and be sensible about that.” The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: I think he was very clear about what he was saying. He was setting out that we do have a signicant testing capacity, andpeople wanted further reassurance they could use that.‘Go to nativity plays - but obviously wear a mask’Care Minister Gillian Keegan encouraged parents to attend school events - but added they should “obviously” follow non-mandatory guidance. Asked about nativity plays, she replied: “I think we’ve said go about your plans. “I mean, obviously wear a mask, be cautious, you know, all the things that people usually put in place, to be honest. “I think most people have been sensible all along, but we’re not saying to people cancel your plans and I’m sure it would be lovely to go to a nativity play right now.” AskedChristmas would be “ruined”, Ms Keegan replied: “Hopefully not”.‘Try not socialising when you don’t need to’Dr Jenny Harries is the odd one out in this list as she’s a non-political scientic advisor to the government, not a Tory minister. But the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agencytriggered the whole row earlier this week with her comments. She said working from home could be a “key” element of controlling a possible surge in future - despite No resisting the measure. She also said “not socialising when we donapost particularly need to” over Christmas could keep the virus at bay. She told the BBC : Weaposve seen that not everybody has gone back to work and Iaposd like to think of it more in a general way.Which iswe all decrease our social contacts a little bit, actually that helps to keep the iant at bay. So I think being careful, not socialising when we donapost particularly need to and particularly going and getting those booster jabs which, of course, people will now be able to have at a three-month interval from their primary course. Boris Johnson directly rejected the advice, adding: “On Christmas parties and nativity plays, we don’t want people to cancel such events.”‘We’re not in Plan B yet and don’t cancel anything’Lastly we come to Boris Johnson, who despite enacting mask laws has insisted we’re still not in his Plan B for winter. He has insisted people should not cancel anything and only need to follow the guidance. Despite saying “what Jenny’s saying there is right”, he directly rejected her advice. Askedhe agreed with her he said: “The answer is no.” The PM added: “We’re not going to change the overall guidance, we don’t think that’s necessary. We don’t see anything to suggest that we need to go for instance to Plan B, but what we do need to do is take particular precautions against Omicron until we’ve worked out exactly what kind of a threat it may present.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonCabinetBBCConservative PartyPoliticsChristmas partyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But the government has made it perfectly clearopinionByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec The annual declaration by the Prime Minister that Christmas should go ahead as planned is swtly becoming a festive tradition.Recent history has shown it is followed by a gt-wrapped ban on household mixing, the twinkling fairy lights of forcibly separated families, and the merry jingle of a Downing Street lock-in. In fact, the sight of Boris Johnson stepping up to a podium and glumly announcing that everything he said two weeks ago has turned out to be wrong creates exactly the same feeling in the hearts of watching children as watching the first snow flake fall, and then seeing it melt on contact with the ground. If the PM had any sense of occasion, heaposd pay Noddy Holder to burst out of the Downing Street curtains yodelling: ITaposS CHRIIIIIIIIISTMAAAAAAAAS! And then weaposd all know exactly where we stood. There remains, however, a confusing degree of iation in how weaposre supposed to observe and participate in the upcoming festive season, with constant mutations of the rules that are actually guidance, but still called rules, and some of which you can be prosecuted for and some you wonapost. So far, weaposve survived the Barnard Castle iant, which damaged the eyesight so much you couldnapost drive but had to self-diagnose while driving the Hancock iant, in which you could snog anyone youaposre not married to so long as it was necessary for work and the Nimco iant, that made support bubbles deflate quicker than an anti-vaxxeraposs confidence after being moved to the ICU.Now, after failing to vaccinate members of the government from the urge to present themselves as freedom fighters, we have been struck by the super-mutant OhmiGOD iant, which originated in Downing Street and makes people do whatever the hell they feel like because why should they care, right  But as politicians are very fond of saying, let me be perfectly clear - the rules have been widely published, and apply to everyone equally. They are as follows:  . You should minimise all social contact, except at Christmas parties where everyone deserves a good knees-up, according to multiple government ministers. Only gatherings that are absolutely necessary for work should take place, according to other government ministers, but this may include Secret Santas, quizzes, and boozy leaving-dos. There is no requirement to ban household mixing, except when London was in Tier  last year when the Prime Ministeraposs household reportedly mixed quite a lot but no-one  was allowed to. Mixing your drinks IS allowed, but donapost forget it is NOT advised to mix the grape with the grain. Banging heads all round. The guidance is that you should go on holiday, attend the nativity play, and hold Christmas parties, especiallyany of these things are being paid for by a millionaire friend of the family and the polls say youaposre bullet-proof. . When it comes to mistletoe, your father is allowed to be aposhandsyapos beneath it, although this is also indecent assault and carries a maximum sentence of  years in prison . You can snog anyone the co-chairman of the Conservative Party Oliver Dowden approves of, but you shouldnapost snog too much in case it upsets Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey . Health Secretary Sajid Javid says you can snog absolutely anybody, so long as you do so cautiously, with just a bit of tongue . After you have avoided jail, disciplinary action, or a firm slap, obtained written approval, and had Sajid measure the amount of tongue slipped to a colleague and classied this as aposcautiousapos, you must wear a mask on your bus home or face a £ fine. If youget to fourth base, you can have as much sex as you like with approved people, but not too much, while remaining cautious, but must make sure you wear a condom when youto your own house. Read more None of these rules applyyou are exempt by way of: a voting Tory b backing Brexit c donating to the Conservative Party d listening to Talk Radio e watching GB News f once meeting someone who does any of the above . And finally, of course, you are exempt from every rule ever writtenyou are put in genuine distress by not having to do much to not kill other people, or you are called Boris.  If you are caught breaking any of the rules, accused of not understanding them, orit is gently pointed out by a psychiatrist that you appear to be living in an alternative reality where the laws of physics, chemistry and biology are apparently as optional as your moral compass, there is a quick-fix solution. You just insist you followed all the rules, while making the rules as confusing as possible, so that nobody knows what the rules are and whether you followed them or not.You then add that you do not recognise any of the logical and factual things being put to you, which makes those questioning you start to question reality itself, and merely despair of you.The sum of all this unaccountability is that the country that has been entrusted to your care does not know which way is up, its people are left to fend for themselves, and the noisy minority of ar**holes can claim to be the silent majority who wishes everyone  were dead and does all they can to make it happen.It doesnapost matter, because you can blame fat people, old people, sick people, or stupid people, and the voter doesnapost realise youaposre talking about them, so will keep giving you % of the vote even in mid-term by-elections in a badly-handled pandemic, with , dead and consequence-free law-breaking in the building where our laws are written, by the people who write them.Merry Christmas, everybody.

Amid the fall-out of The Mirroraposs exclusive story, she asked whether the Cabinet Secretary had been aware of the gatherings that were taking place. Ms Rayner wanted to knowhe would be conducting an internal investigation into the use of Government property for the parties and the role played by Boris Johnson and his officials. The Labour deputy leader wrote: You will no doubt understand the seriousness of the allegations made. This Government is undermining public health messaging with their actions and we cannot let this go on unchecked. It cannot be that the Prime Minister believes there to be a set of rules for the public and a totally dferent set of rules for himself. Mr Johnson and his Downing Street staff have been accused of breaking Covid rules by attending parties at Number  in the run-up to last Christmas. The Prime Minister gave a speech at a packed leaving do for a top aide last November when the country was in the grip of its second lockdown. Then just days before Christmas, with London in tier  restrictions, members of his top team held their own festive bash in Downing Street. It is alleged that officials knocked back glasses of wine during a yuletide quiz and a Secret Santa while the rest of the country was forced to stay at home. The following day the PM aposcancelledapos Christmas for millions of people across the country.Mr Johnson refused three times to deny that the boozy parties had taken place when pressed at PMQs.  No  has claimed that Covid rules were followed at all times. But a Downing Street insider claimed there were often evening get-togethers while millions of people were observing the strict curbs imposed by the PM. The source said: “It was the only place you could get together and socialise. They happened most Fridays.” The Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice group slammed the PM, who faced demands to apologise for what appears to be a clear breach of his own rules. Member Safiah Ngah lost her father Zahari, , to the virus in February. The -year-old said: “Last Christmas is sadly one I will never forget. “One in  people in my borough had Covid- and my family were desperately trying to do what we could to keep each other safe. Unfortunately it wasn’t enough. To think that just a few miles away, Boris Johnson was throwing a ‘Christmas party’, with no care for the rules he had set, is sickening.“In September, he looked bereaved families in the eye and told them he had done ‘everything he could to keep their loved ones safe’. How exactly did breaking the rules himself fit into that  “While he was enjoying an illegal Christmas party, the people he should have been protecting were dying all around the country.” “The first thing the Prime Minister must do is acknowledge the hurt this has caused, and apologise.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Labour Partypolitan PolicePoliticsCoronavirusBoris Johnson\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mince pies baking  Mulled wine simmering  Nope, it’s the stench of utter hypocrisy… yet again. It takes quite something to make Matt Hancock look good – and he still doesn’t, but at least he resigned when caught breaking Covid rules. Boris Johnson instead appears to be adopting the approach of frenemy Dominic Cummings. He and his staff only attended crowded parties during lockdown to test their eyesight, presumably. We all tried to make the best of it, and hark back to Blitz Spirit and the like, but Christmas  was terrible. At best. At worst it was devastating, and tragic, because many were robbed of sharing a loved one’s last ever festive season. That the restrictions were necessary didn’t make them any less painful or easier to endure. The only thing that made the depressing damp squib of a yuletide in any way bearable was the knowledge that we were all in the same boat. So to find out now that a select few REDACT  or  were in fact enjoying Christmas perks like packed parties featuring festive quizzes and enough booze to make a festive quiz seem fun is just too much. Brings a whole new meaning to the term Secret Santa, doesn’t it   Once again, it’s a case of Do As I Say Not As I Do from this hideously corrupt bunch, who do not deny that these parties took place, but insist that “rules were followed.” Something of a contradiction in terms seeing as the rules literally were that these parties could not take place. Just like when the Johnsons were caught having an overnight guest during the peak of lockdown last Christmas, presumably the Prime Minister now considers this matter closed. Remember, he only begs for forgiveness when he loses his place in a speech about Peppa Pig.

Conservative Louie French took more than half the votes in the Old Bexley and Sidcup by-election, but the Tory majority was slashed amid low turnout. Only % of those eligible to vote took part in the contest triggered by the death of Tory MP James Brokenshire in October, with , votes cast. That was down from % at the snap general election. The contest took place following damaging headlines over allegations of sleaze, claims that lockdown rules were broken in No  and the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus iant. The result could prompt Tory jitters ahead of the North Shropshire by-election to replace shamed MP Owen Paterson, who had % of the vote to Labouraposs %. But Labour and the Tories both hailed last nightaposs results in Ted Heathaposs old Bexley seat, which has been Tory since its creation. Ellie Reeves, Labour MP for Lewisham West and Penge, said: “We’re winning back the trust of people and it’s a remarkable result for us in a Tory stronghold. Tory chairman Oliver Dowden claimed this is a good result for a governing party mid-term. Scroll down for the full results  He told Sky News: “This idea Labour had made some surge ahead is really for the birds. They’ve actually got about the same vote share as they secured under Jeremy Corbyn in . “I’m not terribly worried about Labour.” Labouraposs vote share was % in  and % in the by-election. But he didnapost mention the Tory vote share dropped from % in  and % in  to just % now. In his acceptance speech shortly after am on Friday, the new MP said: “I’m incredibly proud of the campaign my team and I have run based on local issues that matter to the people who live here. “And tonight, those people send a clear message: they want an MP who will work with the Government to deliver on their priorities. “My focus will now be delivering on those promises that I made during the campaign – get our fair share of London’s police officers, securing more investment for local schools and hospitals, protecting our precious green spaces.” He promised voters he would “work tirelessly to repay the trust that you’ve placed in me and I will not let you down”. Mr French, a local councillor, said he was the first home-grown MP for the seat. “This is the greatest honour of my le. And I hope it inspires people to achieve their own dreams.  Ellie Reeves, Labour MP for Lewisham West and Penge, said: “I think it’s clear that we’re winning back the trust of people and it’s a remarkable result for us in a Tory stronghold.” She added: Boris Johnson’s incompetence and broken promises have come into sharp focus in a staunch Conservative area.“This result that should worry the Prime Minister. Restricting the Conservatives to less than % of the vote would be “great”, a Labour source said before the result was announced. A party official dismissed the suggestion from Conservative deputy chair Justin Tomlinson that Labour would have to run the Tories “very, very close”it was serious about being an alternative government.  They said: “No Conservative candidate has every got below % in this seat. If we can get them down to %, that will be great.” Mr French’s share of more than % of the vote is “almost unheard of”, the Conservative deputy chairman has said. Justin Tomlinson said: “We’re absolutely thrilled. For a Government to get over % of the vote in a parliamentary by-election is almost unheard of, and with a majority of over %. “A fantastic local candidate, positive campaign, focused on the tangible dference we’re making to people’s lives, having navigated the unprecedented challenges of Covid.” He added that the result was an “absolute disaster” for the Labour Party, saying: “They do not look like a Government in waiting.” Reform leader Richard Tice came in third, claiming his party was now “on the upward march”. A string of senior Tories, including the Prime Minister, have visited the constituency during the by-election campaign, with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps among the MPs bolstering the effort to get out the vote on Thursday. But a turnout of just % suggests the by-election contest has failed to excite the public in the constituency. Labour also had a high-profile on the streets of Old Bexley and Sidcup, with shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves and her sister and shadow solicitor general Ellie among those knocking on doors on polling day on behalf of candidate Daniel Francis. Former Cabinet minister Mr Brokenshire, who had represented the constituency since , was diagnosed with early stage lung cancer in . He held the seat in  with a large majority of , votes. A defeat in the by-election would have been a major blow for Mr Johnson, who has suffered a hit in the polls following weeks of sleaze allegations and political blunders. The constituency has always had a Conservative MP since it was created in . Former Tory Prime Minister Ted Heath held the seat - and its predecessor, Bexley - for  years.The last time Labour won in the constituency was in a  by-election. The seat is in the outer-London boroughs where the Tories and Liberal Democrats are traditionally successful. Neal Lawson, Director of the aposprogressive allianceapos pressure group Compass, said: This strong showing for Labour shows the weakness of Boris Johnson’s government and the benefits of cooperation between progressive parties. With the Lib Dems concentrating on campaigning in North Shropshire, Labour was able to increase its vote as the clear alternative to the Tories. Tributes poured in from across politics to Mr Brokenshire on his death in October at just -years-old. The popular MP was hailed by many for his kindness and decency. He was first diagnosed with cancer in  and resigned as Northern Ireland Secretary to have lung surgery. He ed to Parliament only five weeks later.Mr Brokenshire was made Housing Secretary from April  to July , and he was named as Security Minister in  by Boris Johnson. He took a leave of absence in January  to prepare for another operation, and resigned in July after struggling with his recovery. Mr Brokenshire, who had never smoked, announced in August that the cancer had progressed and he was starting a new line of treatment. Announcing his death in October, his family said in a statement: It is with deep sadness that we announce the death of James Brokenshire MP at the age of . James died peacefully at Darent Valley Hospital yesterday evening with family members by his bedside. He had been in hospital since Sunday after his condition rapidly deteriorated. James was not only a brilliant Government minister as both Security and Immigration Minister at the Home Office and Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office and Ministry for Housing, Communities  Local Government, but a dedicated constituency MP, first for Hornchurch from  to , and then for Old Bexley  Sidcup for the past  years.

Sajid Javid said it was not up to the Government to decide who people can kiss amid growing confusion over Covid guidance this Christmas.New restrictions have been brought in to tackle the Omicron iant, including mandatory masks in shops and on public transport, and PCR tests for all arrivals from abroad.But ministers have sowed confusion by saying wildly dferent things about the guidance - which is voluntary rather than a legal requirement - on things like social contact.Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey told Brits that snogging under the mistletoe should be avoided with people you donapost already know on Wednesday night. But Mr Javid disagreed, telling ITV News today itaposs got nothing to do with the government who you kiss, when asked about how people should behave over the Christmas period.He said: People can snog who they wish. Iaposll certainly be kissing my we under the mistletoe, itaposs a Javid family tradition and itaposs got nothing to do with the government who you kiss, or anything like that. Thereaposs guidance already out there, just be cautious and enjoy yourselves. He did not expand on what he meant by being cautious. Labour leader Keir Starmer also said he didnapost think it was for the Government to dictate who people can kiss or not kiss.I was quite surprised to see that suggestion come out of Government, he told ITV. I think it just demonstrates how they are at sixes and ninesthataposs what they are now discussing. No said of Ms Coffey’s comments: “It is down to iniduals to use their personal judgement”. Earlier this week, top official Dr Jenny Harries enraged Tory backbenchers by saying people should reduce their social contacts and avoid socialising when we donapost particularly need to.  Boris Johnson later contradicted her and said events did not need to be cancelled.But then Tory Minister George Freeman muddied the waters by appearing to suggest people should not have big Christmas parties.He told the BBC : Inidual businesses, in the end, have to make judgments on what is appropriate internally.“It slightly depends on the nature of the business. “For many small businesses, four or five staff, who are working together every day anyway, gathering to have a drink isnapost a big step up in risk. “But some companies might normally bring hundreds of people in from around the world to a big party, and they may decide, this year, is that sensible given the pandemic and given where we are  Mr Freeman also told Times Radio: I can tell you the Department of Business, we wonapost be having a big Christmas party this year. Nobody would expect us to. Later on Thursday, Mr Johnson again insisted that people did not need to cancel their festive plans.  Speaking to broadcasters after having his booster jab in London, the PM said: I want to repeat the guidance is there and Iaposm very, very keen that people understand this, we donapost want people to feel that they need to start cancelling things, to start... you talk about kids in nativity plays and that kind of thing. I donapost think thereaposs any need to stop that at all.I think weaposre taking a balanced and proportionate approach to the risk, but I want and I believe that Christmas this year will be considerably better than Christmas last year.Boss of pub group Youngaposs Patrick Dardis said some Christmas parties had already been cancelled amid concerns over the Omicron iant.He said: I think the messaging has been terribly confusing and inconsistent.

Boris Johnson insisted they should go ahead before a business minister urged them to be scrapped. One pub boss said: “It’s terribly confusing.”With Christmas approaching, families and ­festive revellers are desperate to know what they can or cannot do as the Omicron iant threat grows.But the public were left none the wiser tonight after a stream of mixed messages poured out of Downing Street, from advice on parties to kissing under mistletoe. And the muddled advice caused further outrage among a public already furious at No for holding parties last year during lockdown.  Amid fears get-togethers could spark a surge of the latest Covid iant, Boris Johnson insisted no one should cancel yuletide bashes. But hours earlier, Business Minister George Freeman sug­­gested that larger firms should scrap Christmas parties. The confusion grew further today as Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey warned “snogging under the mistletoe” should be avoided with strangers. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said tonight: “People can snog who they wish.  “It’s got nothing to do with the Government who you kiss. There’s guidance out there, just be cautious and enjoy yourselves.” Mr Johnson, who today had his booster jab at St Thomas’ Hospital in South London, insisted “we want people to continue as they are”. He added: “People should follow the g­uidance that we’ve set out and people shouldn’t be cancelling things, and there’s no need for that at all.” But Mr Freeman cast doubt on works parties. He said: “Inidual businesses must make judgments on what is appropriate ­internally. It depends on the nature of the ­business. “For small businesses, four or five staff, who work together every day anyway, gathering to have a drink isn’t a big step up in risk. But some companies might normally bring hundreds of people in from around the world to a big party, and they may decide is that sensible given the pandemic and given where we are ”  Adding to the lack of clarity, Mr Freeman insisted his Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy would not be having a “big” festive bash – just weeks after Secretary of State Kwasi Kwarteng said a party was already booked. He added: “Nobody would expect us to. My parliamentary team, I think we’ve agreed, ­probably given the new iant, we’ll get together on Zoom and toast each other.” Mr Kwarteng had said on October : “We’ve got some arrangements in place, and I look forward to having a Christmas party as usual.” A Business Department source today said “dferent teams do dferent things” and no single party for BEIS had been planned. It is understood Mr Kwarteng’s bash is still going ahead. The boss of pub group Young’s revealed some parties had already been cancelled due to the confusion. Patrick Dardis said: “I think the messaging has been terribly confusing and inconsistent. “One moment we’re told to avoid socialising and an hour later you have Sajid Javid saying the opposite. “I think the messaging started as a complete ­overreaction and, unsurprisingly, it has concerned some people.” Royal College of Nursing Council chairwoman Carol Popplestone said the “mixed messages” from ministers over Christmas plans could create “even more worry and confusion”. Shadow Business Secretary­ ­Jonathan Reynolds urged revellers to take Covid tests before parties. But he added: “I don’t want to see people cancelling parties now. “People need to live their lives and have some fun but also it has a huge impact on things like the hospitality industry.” A further seven cases of Omicron were confirmed today in England and three in Scotland, the UK Health Security Agency said. It brings the total to . Up  people are believed to have been infected with the iant after a festive party in Norway, the world’s largest outbreak so far. The mixed messages Kissing under the mistletoe Cabinet minister Therese Coffey said: “I don’t think there should be much snogging under the mistletoe.” Askedthere should be “just no snogging ”, she replied: “Well, not with people you don’t already know.” But Health Secretary Sajid Javid declared that people can “snog who they wish” this festive season.  Big Xmas parties Minister George Freeman appeared to be freelancing when he suggested that big firms could cancel their festive bashes. He said: “Some companies might normally bring hundreds of people around the world to a big party. And they may decide this year ‘is that sensible ’” But No  said: “On Christmas parties, we don’t want people to cancel such events.” Socialising Dr Jenny Harries, of the UK Health Security Agency, said “not socialising when we don’t particularly need to” over Christmas could keep the virus at bay. But Boris Johnson rejected the advice, adding: “On Christmas parties and nativity plays, we don’t want people to cancel events.”  Testing Mr Javid tracked close to the official guidance on tests but that only went to show how vague it is. He said there wasn’t “any need to change” Covid rules but said he’d take a lateral flow test before going to a party. “If you are invited to a Christmas party, there’s quite a few people there, maybe you want to take an LFT before you go,” he said. “Go to the party but just be cautious.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Christmas partyPoliticsCoronavirusTory GovernmentCoronavirus lockdown\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden said people should “keep calm and carry on” with festive plans after ministers issued a blizzard of conflicting advice.Cabinet minister Therese Coffey said there shouldn’t be “much snogging under the mistletoe”, only for Health Secretary Sajid Javid to hit back: “People can snog who they wish.”Mr Dowden went down a slightly dferent tack - saying people were free to smooch strangersthey strictly abide by the latest Covid laws in England. That includes mandatory face coverings in shops, supermarkets, shopping centres, banks, estate agents, vets, and on public transport, with £ fines. Asked about kissing, he told LBC: “People should keep calm and carry on with their Christmas plans, as long as they abide by the mask-wearing in the settings we’ve set out, namely public transport and… retail.”  Askedthat meant they could kiss strangers at parties Mr Dowden replied: “If you wish to kiss somebody under the mistletoe, yes, the rules have not changed. “As long as they are a fully consenting adult, yes, you are free to carry on with your Christmas plans.” Askedhe’d kiss anyone he replied: “Only Mrs Dowden,I’m fortunate.”It comes hours after a government advisor warned “personally, I wouldnapost feel safe going to a party at the moment” - evenattendees were vaccinated.Professor Peter Openshaw, a member of SAGE subgroup the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group , said the chances of getting infected were too high”. The Prime Minister and Health Secretary Sajid Javid have urged people not to cancel Christmas parties despite the rise of the Omicron iant, and more than , new cases a day.  Prof Openshaw, an expert in experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said: We have not been planning to have a Christmas party. Because with things as they are, regardless of Omicron, we thought that the chances of getting infected were too high. Asked about the Prime Ministeraposs stance on Christmas plans, Prof Openshaw told BBCaposs Question Time: Personally, I wouldnapost feel safe going to a party at the moment,it involves being indoors in an enclosed space where youaposre close to other people, and people are not wearing masks. Eventheyaposve been tested and vaccinated, I wouldnapost feel safe. Mr Dowden said the Conservative Party is planning a Christmas party for staff, but insisted it is “just a normal Christmas gathering of staff in London” and “completely consistent with the rules”. Askedthere would be games - as there allegedly were during a No Christmas party while London was under lockdown rules last year - Mr Dowden replied: “It’s not a children’s party, so I wouldn’t expect there’ll be games.”  He refused to comment on the Mirror’s revelations about the No party, saying he was not in Downing Street at the time. Earlier the British Medical Associationsaid people should be encouraged to avoid large groups and meet outdoors where possible over the festive period. This goes further than government guidance, which strongly encourages wearing face masks in crowded indoor spaces, and says people may want to take a lateral flow test before going anywhere with crowds. Dr Penelope Toff, chair of the BMAaposs public health medicine committee said contradictory public health messages about Covid- are very unhelpful for everyone. Dr Toff said: There should be no confusion about what to do over the festive period. There have been persistently high levels of Covid- infections in the community in recent months, and we now have a new iant circulating, which is worrying. Stronger measures need to be implemented without delay, to prevent even higher rates of spread of the virus in the community. People need to be encouraged to avoid large groups, to meet only outdoors where possible and face masks should be worn in all public indoor spaces except when people are seated to eat and drink. In a joint statement, UKHospitality, the British Institute of Innkeeping and the British Beer  Pub Association urged those with Christmas plans not to cancel, with bookings down on previous years.

Steven McPartland already works ten hours a month as a non-executive director of Furniture Village, from which he pockets more than £, a month. But the latest Register of Membersapos Interests reveals the MP for Stevenage now puts more time in as a strategic adviser for MBU Capital Group, for which he will be paid £, a month. According to National World, MBU Capital Group is a London-based financial firm which invests in national resources, education, cannabis CBD and real estate. He took the new job on  November , and according to the register, expects to work for eight hours a month - which amounts to £ an hour.  Mr McPartland, shortly before his election in , promised: “If I became Stevenageaposs MP, I would treat it as a full-time job.” Boris Johnson has promised an overhaul of the rules governing MPs outside earnings - banning MPs from “exploiting their positions” by working as paid consultants. But Labour have argued his plans don’t go far enough, and pledged to ban all second jobs for MPs, with just a few exemptions.It emerged last night that a string of Tory MPs had given up their second jobs in the wake of the scandal. The latest register of members interests shows former chief whip Julian Smith has given up paid roles worth more than £, a year. They include Hygen Energy - a green fuel firm founded by Jo Bamford, the son of JCB mogul and major Tory donor Sir Anthony Bamford - which paid him up to £, a year as an “external adviser advising on business development”. Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith’s register has been updated to show he is no longer a member of the advisory board of healthcare tech firm Tunstall. And Winchester MP Steve Brine’s record has been updated to say he has stepped back as a “strategic adviser” to Sigma pharmaceuticals.

The six-year-old was living with his paternal grandparents, who “loved and cherished him”, when the pandemic hit. But his dad Thomas Hughes decided to move in with girlfriend Emma Tustin when the country was plunged into lockdown.Today his evil stepmum convicted of murdering the defenceless child after a horric campaign of abuse, while his dad was found guilty of manslaughter.Det Insp Laura Harrison, of West Midlands Police, said it “was the worst decision that could have been made”. “If only Hughes had left Arthur with his grandparents who absolutely doted on him, loved him and cherished him,” she told the Mirror. “The manipulation and the toxic relationship between Tustin and Hughes meant the family were cut out of Arthur’s le and didnapost play a part. “The lockdown meant professionals didn’t have the opportunity to monitor him in the same way they would do with children normally. “I do think that lockdown contributed. “The professionals who would ordinarily have been involved in Arthur’s le, such as teachers, weren’t having that contact with him and spotting changes in his behaviour or bruises on his body. “Tustin and Hughes cut off family members so Arthur was no longer seeing or speaking to him. “And when social workers went out to Tustin’s home there was an absolute manipulation of them by the defendants. “It was the only day when Arthur was allowed to play in the garden and he presented very dferently as a result. “When the professionals did speak to him they weren’t picking up on the signs they would have donehe had been segregated in a hallway. “Tustin and Hughes pulled the wood over the eyes of the professionals. They didn’t want children’s services involved.” Specialist grief counsellors were drafted in to help police left traumatised by Arthur’s death.  Veteran detectives were left in tears as they watched CCTV footage of the helpless youngster alone in his family home. They also discovered harrowing evidence that Arthur had been sadistically poisoned with salt by his dad and step-mum. DI Harrison described it as the “most traumatic” case she had ever investigated. She compared his death to the murder of Daniel Pelka, the tragic four-year-old boy killed by his mum and step-dad in . In both cases the children were deliberately poisoned with salt to increase the suffering before their deaths. “I knew when we started it was a horric case, but there have been moments that have just completely got me,” she said.  “Everyone involved has found it really haunting having to witness and experience the evil and horric torture that Arthur was subjected to. “There are real similarities with Daniel Pelka, definitely in terms of salt poisoning. “I’d not heard of it before in child cruelty cases and it’s been really hard to comprehend. But it is a haunting parallel. “A physical assault is one thing - but it’s very devious and manipulative to dose a child up with salt. It’s another level of evil. “It could only have been done as another way to control Arthur - an extra punishment. “We think maybe they did it to make him more thirsty but we don’t know because they’ve never given us an explanation. “It’s been really dficult for the officers who have to sit for hours watching CCTV footage of Arthur being isolated.  “I arranged for a trauma counsellor to come in to explain the emotions people might be experiencing and to teach coping mechanisms they could put in place. “They have been able to independently see the counsellor without the rest of the team knowing. “We don’t ordinarily get faced with CCTV like this. “The footage really got to the heart of what Arthur was being subjected to and thataposs why it’s been so hard-hitting and dferent to similar cases. “When you add in the  recordings of Arthur in distress and the brutal text messages, it sets it apart from the Pelka and Baby P cases. “We’ve been reliant on medical expert opinion and it’s been crucial. “But the actual emotional element of this case has been proved by that CCTV or hearing audio clips where he is calling out for family members, calling out for food or water, and that nobody loves him. “We all know children in our lives. You just cannot comprehend anybody being able to neglect a child over such a sustained period of time. “It was not a sudden loss of control, it was a well thought-out campaign of abuse, both physically and psychologically, towards Arthur.” DI Harrison said it was “hard to comprehend” how Hughes and Tustin tried to blame Arthur for his fatal injuries. She said: “They’ve blamed each other and they’ve blamed Arthur as well. “How can a six-year-old boy be responsible for what happened  We know he couldn’t have inflicted his fatal injuries himself. “They are both equally responsible. Although Tustin killed Arthur, Hughes encouraged the killing by actions.” The sheer cruelty of the couple was played out in the courtroom over two months. Texts between them showed their feelings towards the little boy, whose mother was previously jailed for the manslaughter of her boyfriend. In brutal messages, Hughes told Tustin to aposjust endapos Arthur and also apostake his jaw offapos and aposgagapos him. He also threatened to apostake his neck offapos and aposdash my food off his headapos. The day before the child died, his dad texted about paying someone to aposdig Arthuraposs graveapos. Tustin was equally vile, the court was told. In one message she said aposf****** launch this lying little f***apos and in another she warned she was aposgoing to chin this little c***apos.

Residents living in Enderby Gardens, Middlesbrough, have spoken of their terror following stabbings, shootings and an arson attack in the area, say reports.One woman, Victoria Fairbridge, , said she has been the victim of harassment from teenage gangs since Halloween, reports Teesside Live.From throwing stones and pumpkins at her windows to threatening her family, the yobs have caused her to feel like sheaposs no longer safe in the area sheaposs lived most of her le. A mum to a six-year-old with a recently diagnosed heart condition and an eight-year-old on the autistic spectrum, Victoria said her children have been targeted as well when sheaposs asked the thugs to leave her property.  She said: It all started just before Halloween, they started throwing things at the house and I asked them nicely to leave so they didnapost disturb my kids. They began to kick off at me and told me that they were going to aposbeat the disabled outapos of my son and aposcut his head offapos. Victoria believes that the group harassing her family are aged  to , and claimed they are always covered with scarves, balaclavas and dark clothing so theyaposre almost impossible to identy and report. As well as her house, Victoria said that groups of youths are terrorising houses all over Hemlington and have even started abusing her next door neighbours. She added: Iaposve lived in Hemlington almost all my le and itaposs never been this bad, we never used to cause trouble when I was growing up.  My neighbour politely asked a groupthey could go away from our houses as theyaposre scaring the kids and she was laughed at. The abuse and language that comes out of their mouths is absolutely disgraceful. Victoria said she has been urged to leave her house and move where, but she explained itaposs not that simple to do so. She said: The ideal situation would be to move house of course, but itaposs not easy. Iaposm a single mum of two boys, one with a newly diagnosed heart condition and another with autism so they need so much care. I canapost afford private rent and Iaposm not in the position to move anywhere  as times are hard. The Sun reports that other families have also complained about the thuggish behaviour. Dad-of-four Peter Thomson said: There was a shooting around the corner. Just outside our house a taxi driver was robbed by people with machetes. The teenagers walk around with balaclavas on and they go about terrorising the estate. Iaposve had motorbikes stolen from my garden. Iaposve had to spend over £ on CCTV and a cage to stop the theft. A lad around the corner had bricks put through his windows. He said things had become so bad that even the police are scared of them. Amy Hughes who has lived on the estate for seven years said she is often too scared to leave her home. The -year-old, who currently isnapost working due to ill health, claimed yobs had set her bins alight as well as putting bricks and stones through windows.  She added there had also been stabbings in the area. Cleveland Police said in a statement: “Police have been working with local agencies including the council and housing to help tackle the issues that have been reported, including regular patrols in this area by local authority street wardens.There is continued work ongoing with partner agencies to address the problems and we would continue to urge anyone who has been a victim of crime or antisocial behaviour to report it to police on , or call Crimestoppers on   .” Kay Glew, director of operations at Thirteen Housing Group, added: “The safety and security of our customers is extremely important to us and we have been working closely with Ms Fairbridge and our community partners in the police and council to address the issues that she has raised.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cleveland PoliceTeenagers\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He said: Iaposve called them three times and emailed as well. The email just told me to fill out a survey.Iaposve spoke with three dferent people and they said they were going to treat it as an emergency, reports the Liverpool Echo.When I called on the Friday someone said they were going to come down in the early hours of the morning but Iaposve just been waiting since.  Keith said a big issue is now that children are able to access the train line, by using the gap in his fence, and he fears for their safety. He added: Iaposve got children climbing over as well. Theyaposre about six or seven and keep trying to come down. Thereaposs a school just down the road. We have to sit there constantly in limbo watching to make sure the kids donapost get on the wall and climb on the track again. Thereaposs also debris from the fence on the ground. If it blows in front of a train it could cause accidents. On the Network Rail website the company states: We’re responsible for the fencing that forms the boundary to the railway. If there’s a problem with our fencing we will either fix the fence or replace it. This doesn’t apply to other fences that may be parallel to our boundary measure. If there’s a gap and we can’t immediately carry out a permanent repair, then weaposll do a temporary repair first of all. If we can’t repair the fence to a safe standard, and a fence is needed to keep the railway safe, we’ll replace it with a new one of a similar size and type.  Keith said in the past he has had to have staff from Network Railaposs health and safety team on site when work was carried out on his house. He said: The fence isnapost on my property itaposs next to the railway track so itaposs up to them to replace it. When I got some work done down the side of my house, their health and safety team had to be there. They wouldnapost let anyone on the wall side of the track, so I canapost see it being my responsibility on that side of the wall. A Network Rail spokesperson said: “Storm Arwen cause widespread destruction across the country’s rail network and our engineers are working round the clock to fix the damage. We’d always encourage people to report issues with railway fencing and thank this resident in West Kirby for doing so. The local maintenance team is aware and will make the necessary repairs as soon as possible.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Railways\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Heekyoung Jin is now the homeowner of a stunning five-bedroom house, located just behind Wimbledon’s famous Centre Court. She and her partner, Tom Hall, , a software engineering manager, have been together for  years and have a two-year-old son called Lukas. At three months old, Lukas suffered with breathing dficulties and was admitted into the intensive care unit at Great Ormond Street Hospital, where he was diagnosed with a rare condition. He had an irregular growth on his chest and underwent le-saving surgery to remove this at the hospital, where he stayed for three months.  “Great Ormond Street Hospital saved my child’s le,” Heekyoung said. “Every single one of its staff were amazing and helped us through an incredibly dficult time. “Thanks to them, Lukas is now a healthy and happy boy and we are eternally grateful. “The work they do is so important - they’re real-le superheroes. Heekyoung entered the Million Pound House Draw, hosted by charity-raising , Omaze, as it was raising funds for the Great Ormond Street charity, supporting the hospital that helped Lukas. The demand and inventory analyst from Seoul, South Korea, said: “I think the partnership between Omaze and GOSH Charity is a brilliant idea. “It’s raising money to help the charity keep doing their incredible work to help children just like Lukas when they need it the most.”When the draw opened, Heekyoung spotted it on Instagram on the first day and purchased a £ ticket bundle. For the last two years, the family has lived in a four-bedroom house in Wallington, Sutton, Greater London, but she loved the look of the grand prize. Now, she will soon be moving into her new home which has a range of luxurious features, such as a reception hall, spacious sitting room and dining room, a family room and a study. She said: “We’ve always dreamed of owning a house like this. “We used to live in a one-bed flat in Wimbledon and would often walk past these houses imagining what it would be like to live in one - and now we actually do. “We will be moving in as soon as possible - Lukas has already chosen his room.” Other rooms include an open plan sitting and dining space with kitchen, a huge master bedroom complete with an en-suite and dressing area, as well as three additional bedrooms and an impressive two-tier garden.  Heekyoung has also received £, in cash to help with running costs and all her stamp duty and legal fees have been covered too. The prize was presented by a few members of the Omaze team, who surprised her at home with a Love Actually-inspired reveal, complete with carol singers and messages on large cards. In a clip, a woman knocks on their front door before holding up a sign that reads: You are one of our grand prize winners. Heekyoung is shown in disbelief as she puts her hands to her face, while Tom smiles with pure excitement. As the family-of-three enter their new home, they are seen taking a look around before sharing Lukas’ story. Heekyoung adds: “It’s the biggest I’ve won before.” As the luxurious home is showcased on screen, Tom adds: “We are going to live here and enjoy it with our son and maybe more family in future.”  In the garden, it is revealed that the prize draw has raised £, for GOSH Charity. As the prize winners celebrate and are showered with confetti, Heekyoung is shown crying while holding up her new house key. Tom ends the video by saying: “This is undoubtedly the best Christmas present we’ve ever had.” James Oakes, SVP International at Omaze, said: “We’re thrilled that Heekyoung has won her dream home and was also able to contribute to the fantastic £, raised for a charity that means so much to her family. “Omaze is a win-win for both charities and entrants. “By offering an incredible prize like this stunning house in Wimbledon, we’re giving people the incredible chance to win the house of their dreams, whilst also introducing charities to audiences they wouldn’t usually be able to reach. “This method of fundraising is helping to make a big dference to causes all around the UK.” The campaign’s donations will help to fund pioneering research, state-of-the art medical equipment, vital support services for children and their families and the essential rebuilding and refurbishment of the hospital. Louise Parkes, GOSH Charity Chief Executive, said: “Despite all the challenges of the Covid- pandemic, our mission has stayed the same to help transform the lives of seriously ill children who arrive at GOSH. “The pandemic has had a signicant impact on our ability to fundraise, so the money raised by this Omaze campaign will make a real dference. “We’re so grateful to Omaze and to everyone who has taken part for this fantastic donation.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Great Ormond Street HospitalCharitiesHospitals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The research, which has not been peer-reviewed, found people who had tested positive for Covid could pick up the virus again. It did not say how the iant will behave when spreading in a highly vaccinated population such as the UK, or whether the virus can evade the protection offered by vaccines against severe disease. The new study estimated that the risk of reinfection for November  to , when Omicron was circulating, was . times higher than in the first wave of the pandemic in early . In contrast, the risk of reinfection in South Africa was lower in the Beta and Delta waves than in the first wave. The findings suggest Omicron could cause a wave of infections in people with some prior immunity.  The researchers, from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases , looked at data from almost . million people with Covid- who had a positive test result at least  days before November . Some , suspected reinfections were identied among the ,, people . The authors concluded: Population-level evidence suggests that the Omicron iant is associated with substantial ability to evade immunity from prior infection. In contrast, there is no population-wide epidemiological evidence of immune escape associated with the Beta or Delta iants.  This finding has important implications for public health planning, particularly in countries like South Africa with high rates of immunity from prior infection. Urgent questions remain regarding whether Omicron is also able to evade vaccine-induced immunity and the potential implications of reduced immunity to infection on protection against severe disease and death. Dr Abdou Salam Gueye, regional emergency director for the World Health Organisationaposs Regional Office for Africa, told a press briefing there was concern about reinfections. She said: We monitor these reinfectionsfor the Beta and for the Delta wave we didnapost see an increase in reinfections over and above what weexpect when the force of infection changes when the wave stops. However we are seeing an increase for Omicron. And that speaks to the fact that in our population with a high seroprevalence - so where many people have had previous infection - we believe that their previous infection does not provide them protection from infection due to Omicron. However, hopefully it provides them with protection against severe disease, hospital admissions and death. She said the susceptibility of the population of South Africa is greater now because previous infection used to protect against Delta and now with Omicron and doesnapost seem to be the case. But she added: We believe that vaccines will still, however, protect against severe disease because weaposve seen this decrease in protection using vaccines with the other iants - the vaccines have always held out to prevent severe disease and admission into hospital from death. The same things that held true for the other iants, I think, to a large extent hold true for this iant. Professor Francois Balloux, from University College London , said the findings were not surprising given the number of mutations in the new iant. He said the research could not account for waning levels of immunity. He added: Risk of reinfection by the Omicron iant was estimated to be around three times higher than by the Alpha and Delta iant. The study is competently performed and highly timely as it provides the first direct evidence for the increased ability of the Omicron iant to partially bypass prior host immunity conferred by prior infection. The study does not provide any insight on the robustness of vaccine-induced immunisation against the Omicron iant. It also does not report any data on infection severity. South Africa has a low vaccination rate but a large proportion of the population has been infected during previous Covid- waves. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter The population of South Africa also tend to be fairly young with a median age of . years. As such, the results from this study are not directly portable to other settings such as Europe or North America, and more data will be needed before we can make more any robust prediction about the potential threat posed by a global spread of the Omicron iant in dferent parts of the world. Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: This analysis does look very concerning, with immunity from previous infections being relatively easily bypassed. Might this all still be a  alarm  That is looking less and less likely. We do not yet have up-to-date information on vaccine effectiveness. However, the situation should, to some extent, be dferent with vaccine-generated immunity. The immune response from vaccination is much stronger when compared with infection-acquired immunity. Whilst there is likely to be some impact, it is likely vaccines will still provide some level of protection. The booster dose may be key here in maintaining a high level of protection. Whilst we await more data to emerge over the coming days and weeks, the message to the general public has to be: go and get all the doses you are eligible for. Keep that protection as high as possible.

Between the years of  and , the great plague of London took the lives of around , people,  per cent of the capitalaposs population at the time. Living conditions were overcrowded and extremely unsanitary, providing a perfect environment for the bubonic plague to spread like wildfire. With the plague gripping London and the death toll being so high, it begs the question of where exactly did the bodies of the deceased ended up  The epidemic resulted in the need for a number of plague pits to be put into action across the city and surrounding countryside. Most of these sites were originally the grounds of churches, but as the booming body count outgrew the graveyards, the pits were hastily constructed.So where are these plague pits today  Historic UK have created an interactive map that details where many of the mass graves lie as part of an ongoing project. The prevalence of these burial sites means that there’s likely to be thousands of bodies of plague victims buried beneath your very feet in London - quite the blood curdling thought. Locating the graves is dficult with very little evidence to go on, but the mapaposs locations are based on ious historical sources, including Daniel Defoe’s ‘A Journal of the Plague Year’, which was first published in . Social media channels and ongoing archaeological digs also help to inform of the whereabouts of the plague pits but unless the city was entirely excavated, it’s likely that many could remain a mystery. Deborah Johnson, who is working on the Historic UK project, told Huffington Post UK : We have had lots of interaction from people regarding other possible plague pit sites in London, allowing us to update our information accordingly.We aim to produce the most accurate and comprehensive map of London’s plague pits. There is a story that details that when workers were constructing the Aldgate Station in the City of London in the s, a large plague pit was uncovered. The mass grave was reportedly  feet inand  feet in width, containing around  bodies. Historical books focusing on this site suggest that the bodies were buried with haste, without a ceremony or even a coffin. In this instance, the skeletons were buried for two centuries before discovery, meaning that Londoners had walked the streets of London without the knowledge that  corpses lay beneath their very feet.  Much later, in  when the Crossrail was being built, a plague pit thought to be the biggest ever discovered was found in Charterhouse Square, Farringdon. Dozens of skeletons were discovered, but it is believed that up to , bodies could be buried in this vicinity. The Museum of London was drafted in to excavate around the remains.At the time, Jay Carver, from Crossrail, told Channel  News: We found something that we donapost find very often and thataposs a group of skeletons that we think died at a specic date and we have dating evidence to prove that from the pottery that was found in the graves with the skeletons.For funeral notices in your area visit funeral-notices Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Daniel DefoeChannel Great Plague of LondonRailwaysDignity FuneralsFrisk\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Her mum is determined that this Christmas will not be her little girls lastIslas mum is fighting for her daughter Image: MyLondon WSByAyokunle Oluwalana:,  Dec A mum whose young daughter was given a devastating cancer diagnosis is in a race against time to save her le. Nicola Catonaposs daughter Isla is just seven years old and has been fighting the disease since she was two. Her family, from Stratford, East London, have been searching all over trying to find the right treatment and clinical trial which would help her, after a doctor gave her just three months to live. For mum Nicola, this has been five years of seeing her daughter battle the aggressive cancer and she is determined that this will not be her last Christmas.Before she was unwell, we used to call her aposbam bamapos. She was full of energy, Nicola told My London.She was a big, bouncy baby. Then, she was unwell for three months before she even got a diagnosis. Suddenly when Isla was just two, everything changed.  Nicola noticed that she was losing weight, had high temperatures and was always in pain and rubbing her legs. She took Isla to the hospital a number of times and said that AE said I was being over-sensitive about everything. Nicole knew something was wrong and insisted on Isla being checked out and eventually went to a private doctor. She said: When he examined her and saw how much weight she lost, he turned to me and said aposI think this is something seriousapos. They did an ultrasound. He told us it was cancer. I fainted. We never dreamed this would happen to our big, healthy baby.  Isla had been diagnosed with Neuroblastoma, a rare type of cancer that mostly affects babies or young children, and started treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital. It was there that Nicola met families with children going through a similar situation to Isla. When we first started fundraising, the other families told us that Neuroblastoma is extremely hard to cureyou relapse, she said. There is only a  per cent chance of survival at the beginning. As treatment began on Isla, the plan was to get her into remission and take her to America for a clinical trial. Nicola said: If we could get Isla into remission, there was a vaccine in America that would hopefully prevent the cancer relapsing. Sadly, Isla relapsed before she finished her frontline treatment, as doctors found a brain tumour, which was then removed. As the family tried to fundraise for another treatment in the US, Isla relapsed again. There were now several spots on her bones. She said: In July , our consultant basically looked at us and said. aposTake her home. Sheaposs got three months to liveapos. This news was heartbreaking for the family but Nicola could never give up hope for her little girl. She reached out to doctors worldwide about Neuroblastoma and spoke to parents going through the same turmoil. She said: The consultant called us and said Isla only has a two per cent chance of survival now.  I said, aposwhy canapost Isla be dferent aposItaposs this sheer determination that caused the family to fundraise to give Isla a better chance at le and hopefully find a cure.The family spent two years in Barcelona and the family were accessing trial after trial to try and get Isla back into remission. Things seemed to look up for her when she went into remission but in February , she relapsed again. Nicola said: In Spain, we spent around £, on medical bills. It was really hard, there were constant bills, paying for our house in the UK. Our only focus was on getting Isla back into remission. At the start of the pandemic in March , the family left Spain and moved back to London. This was a devastating blow to the family as they couldnapost go out and fundraise or access any treatment. We werenapost able to access any treatments, Nicola explained. We made a decision that after July that we wouldnapost be able to go back to Spain.Thankfully we found something on the NHS but unfortunately it didnapost work. Then on Christmas Eve, they told us itaposs not working.Since then itaposs just been chemotherapy to chemotherapy. Trying to hold the cancer at bay. Nicola feels sad for Isla. She doesnapost know any dferent and has missed out on a number of things just trying to live. Nicola said: She was miserable in Spain. She missed her sister. For the last five years, Iaposve focused on saving her le. We had to make a decision on whether we gave her a great le or tried to save it. At the beginning of , I vowed to give her the best le possible. Weaposd really like to make a lot of memories and let her enjoy everything. The plan for December is to have Father Christmas visit their home and spend quality time with the rest of the family. In the New Year, they want to be able to take her to CBeebies. Nicola added: The thing you miss most in the world is normality. Just being around family and having her home. A big part of Islaaposs battle is also to raise awareness for Neuroblastoma. Weaposre a working-class family and the people who have helped are just normal people, Nicola added. Itaposs really amazing.

Spoty Wrapped features the useraposs top artists, genres, songs, podcasts and minutes listened and generates shareable graphics. It’s safe to say that the feature is exposing some of us, with plenty of guilty pleasures sneaking onto the list. And there’s an algorithm to work out how our Spoty Wrapped is put together.According to the FAQs, Spoty will gather data from qualied users The algorithm will then narrow it down to this specic criteria:You’ve listened to at least five dferent artists You’ve listened to at least  dferent songs Streams are countedyou listen for at least  secondsThe rankings are then based on a combination of the number of plays, and the unique number of days you’ve listened. For the top five artists and top five songs, it’s all based on playcount, but the ranking of the top  songs on your playlist is dferent.  At first, it’s initially sorted by playcount, but after track , Spoty will apply ‘artist separation’ so it’s not a direct reflection of playcount. For those who enjoy a podcast whilst doing their washing up, your podcast time will count towards your general Spoty listening time. So, total minutes  music + podcasts If you listen to at least  seconds of a podcast, you’ll be eligible for at least one podcast story. Topping the artists globally this year was rapper Bad Bunny who had over . billion streams - and that was without an album release.Then we had Taylor Swt, BTS, Drake and Justin Bieber ranking as favourites all over the world.It’s hats off to Olivia Rodrigo though, who had two of her songs ‘Driver’s License’ and ‘Good  U’ in the top five songs all over the world.They were also the two top songs streamed in the UK, as well as Bad Habits by Ed Sheeran and Monteroby Lil Nas X.Now you know that there are specic calculations behind your Spoty Wrapped, you can’t really deny the fact you may have been listening to musical soundtracks all year.

Mr Johnson said “we don’t want people to feel that they need to start cancelling things” and insisted that “Christmas this year will be considerably better than Christmas last year”. He was speaking after business minister George Freeman appeared to muddy the waters by suggesting parties may depend on how many people are attending, while Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey suggested “snogging under the mistletoe” should be avoided with “people you don’t already know”. Health Secretary Sajid Javid “people can snog who they wish”, adding that people should be cautious but “it’s got nothing to do with the Government who you kiss or anything like that”. But Dr Penelope Toff, chair of the BMA’s public health medicine committee said “contradictory public health messages about Covid- are very unhelpful for everyone”. Dr Toff said: “There should be no confusion about what to do over the festive period. “There have been persistently high levels of Covid- infections in the community in recent months, and we now have a new iant circulating, which is worrying. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youaposve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The horse seems to not be phased and waits for her to finish patiently, and the two ride off after the staff members give her her meal. Speaking today, Simon a vehicle parts constructor, said: I was on my way home from collecting my little one from school when we stopped by for something to eat.We were sitting there waiting for our food when she came round the corner.I couldnapost believe it - the horse was very well-behaved though and she got served no problem, before riding off. A few of the kids who were sitting inside came out to take pictures and cheer her as they thought it was great. He added: She was served and rode off. Then I passed her on the road where she was eating the burger.My son loved it, it really made his day - he was laughing so much.I thought it was really funny as well - itaposs something you just canapost imagine seeing unless you live in the Welsh valleys. Simon shared the images to social media with the caption aposWell Iaposve seen it all now...only in the Valleys,apos and it has since received a lot of attention by amused internet users.One person, Johnny Springsteen said: I wonder what the brake power is on that!Mark Barber said: Neigh gherkins.Dav Doc said: Horses are at drive-thrus all the time - only problem is they normally end up becoming the burgers themselves.Ben English said: Probably just wants a chicken Mc-neigh-get meal...And Shane Matthews simply added: Wow, awesome.

Hollee Lynnea-Kolenda Darnell, , who is from the US city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, got hitched recently to new hubby, Jackson, at a ceremony in Florida. Though the day started well, a sudden bout of sickness caused her to swoon into her concerned hubbyaposs arms during their vows.Her worried sweetheart can be heard asking whether she is okay as she comes back around. Hollee - dressed in a flowing, white bridal gown - shakes her head and stumbles over to the edge of the gazebo, and vomits over the side. In the clip, which has since gone viral, her caption read: I kept trying to tell my husband I didn’t feel good and he thought I was joking. The footage ended there, but the bride said there was still more bad wedding luck to come. In the caption she wrote: My baby nephew pooped on my dress right after while I was puking. Hollee later explained the reason for the sudden sickness. In a follow-up video she said she hadnapost eaten or drunk enough water during her big day, leaving her really dehydrated. She added: It was also Florida, and it was so hot and humid that day. We were drenched, it was so hot.Iaposm also prone to passing out, my doctor says I have low blood pressure and low iron. I guess I was just doomed from the start.  I wasnapost throwing up too much just because there wasnapost anything in my stomach so it wasnapost like the nasty, nasty throw up. My sister had a fan on my baby nephew, she came over to put that fan on me and as sheaposs holding my nephew, he starts pooping. And the poop goes down her arm onto my dress. The couple had already tied the knot at court a few hours before the outdoor do, which was just a small gathering with close friend and family.  For their honeymoon, the couple went to New York City straight after the winery ceremony. She managed to get some stunning wedding photos in the Big Apple by getting her dressed cleaned swtly after.

The British socialite drafted in draconian rules when she took over the running of the billionaire paedophile’s Palm Beach home in Florida while it was overrun with “hundreds” of topless girls. Epstein’s former housekeeper Juan Alessi today took to the stand in Maxwell’s sex grooming and abuse trial in New York to detail how his job changed when she arrived. From the day she came to the house, she right away took over and she mentioned to me she was going to be the lady of the house,” said Alessi, who managed the Florida property from  to . The -year-old, who once visited Maxwell’s London home, said his relationship with Epstein was cordial until she arrived.  “Only I was supposed to speak to Mr Epstein when he asked me questions,” Alessi recalled as one of Maxwell’s missives. “At the end of my stay, there was a time when she say, ‘Jeffrey doesn’t like to be looked at in his eyes. You should never look at his eyes - just look at another part of the room and answer him.” Alessi went on to detail what became expected of him including ensuring “the cars had to be immaculate,” and filled with  bills while “the house had to be run like a five-star hotel.” When he was asked by the prosecutionhe ever saw females by the pool, Mr Alessi replied hundreds of times.” Asked what percentage were they topless, he said “about  per cent to  per cent of the time.” Pushed further about Maxwell’s time at the house, where Prince Andrew once stayed and which was knocked down earlier this year, the former housekeeper was asked where she slept when in the home. “She would sleep in Mr Epsteinaposs bedroom,” he replied. Mr Alessi said Maxwell, , refused to call him by his real name, Juan, instead addressing him by its English adaptation. “She called me John,” he said. Mr Alessi said he worked long hours for the couple, clocking up to  hours per sht when he began working for the financier in .

A lot of work. A lot of work,” he told the jury. Mr Alessi complained about the y checklist of tasks Maxwell had him perform, which he said was made for ten men, not one and a half. He called it very degrading to him. The full indictment against her lists six charges: conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity transporting a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking of a minor. The defendant is further alleged to have lied under oath by hiding her participation in Epsteinaposs offences during a separate civil case. These offences are to be heard at a later date in a separate trial. Maxwell, who has been held in a US jail since her arrest in July last year, denies all charges. If convicted she faces up to  years in prison. Epstein committed suicide in August  while in jail. He was arrested a month earlier and charged with child sex offences.

It looks like Bruce has got into a food container, leaving its tattered remnants on the floor of the kitchen. But the naughty dog doesn’t fancy facing the consequences of his actions. The moment unsuspecting Bruce strolls in from the back garden, his owner confronts him. “Was that you ” he asks, pointing to the mess on the floor. But the husky is instantly having none of it. With a quick glance at the mess, Bruce assesses the situation and decides his best course of action is to get out of there. Turning back around, the dog casually strolls back the way he came and disappears through the doggy door in the wall. His owner isn’t about to give up, and follows Bruce outside - leading to the cheeky husky sticking his head straight back through the dog flap in an attempt to hide. He freezes, half inside and half out, when he sees his owner standing in the doorway - not expecting his cunning escape plan to be foiled so easily. The poor pup gives a defeated howl when he finally realises there’s no avoiding this telling-off. TikTok viewers fell in love with Bruce and his cheeky antics, with the clip racking up over four and a half million likes, and people commented on what the guilty dog might be thinking.  “I feel like he said ‘I’ll be back when you calm down’,” one person commented. Another said: “He said, ‘I don’t have time for this negativity dad!’” “He’s like ‘I’m not answering any questions until my lawyer gets here’,” joked a third. Bruce isn’t the only dramatic husky who’s desperately tried to avoid doing something he doesn’t fancy lately.In another TikTok clip that left viewers in hysterics, dog Winter struggled with all her might to avoid her least favourite activity - bath time.The hilarious video shows Winter wrestling her owner as she’s carried towards the dreaded bathroom, attempting to grip onto the door frames with her paws before she finally accepts her fate.

When I refused, she smashed a glass on the ground and said, this is why celebrities dont come here Image: Katherine DinsdaleopinionByKatherine Dinsdale:,  Dec | comments“Get paid to party” – scroll through the bartender jobs section of Indeed and this will come up on your feed. Sounds ideal right  Except at that party, you’re the designated driver. Instead of pouring yourself drinks, people keep taking them off you. For all the pub lovers and club fanatics, I’m going to be giving you a glimpse into the world of bartending. So, grab your trusty pink spray and blue roll, and let’s travel to the other side of the suspiciously sticky bar. They say you can’t judge a book by its cover, but that’s part of the job. When someone with a bleach bob haircut and suit jacket asks for a glass of your finest prosecco – you know it’s time to run. It’s not that we care about what you drink, but certain orders do tend to trigger our fight or flight response. And for good reason. A self-described “TikTok influencer” once came into a bar I worked at and demanded I served her a free cocktail pitcher. When I refused, she smashed a glass on the ground and said, “this is why celebrities don’t come here”. I’m sure bar popularity took a real hit from not being featured on her k follower TikTok account. But it can’t all be mixing with the stars. Ordinary people can also be a nightmare when you supply them with enough booze. Once a man downed a pint of Guinness in front of me, looked me straight in the eyes and said: “Where’s my drink  I want to speak to the manager.” I know alcohol is meant to cause memory loss, but surely not to that degree.  And for those of you who decide to order one of each cocktail on the menu five minutes before close – there’s a special place in bar hell for you. But anyone in the industry will tell you that all of this is preferable to the dreaded end of the night toilet checks. Bar toilets are absolute anarchy – especially in the hygiene department.  Take it from me, the woman who once had to witness someone fish a pink wig out of a used toilet on Halloween, and then kindly put it back on her friend’s head. And let’s not forget the time I found a poo-filled bottle of Corona stuck in the women’s toilets. Yes, I’m shaming you. After witnessing the absolute worst of drunkards, you’d think at closing time the last thing we’d want to think about would be alcohol. But after cling-filming every bottle of wine in the building, a pint at  in the morning seems more inviting than you might think. Plus, itaposs free - one of the perks of working at a bar I must admit. So next time you have a particularly wild night out and wake up with that dreaded hangover anxiety, just know your mates aren’t the only ones who have embarrassing stories about you. But we’ll forgive you,you promise to not pay with both cash and card next time you come in.

What do you think about Toriaposs prank  Let us know in the comments...Tori, from US, said she borrowed the idea from the naughty Elf on the Shelf and came up with a prank when her three-year-old girl was misbehaving. Admitting that they are a Christmas after Halloween family, Tori showed her parenting trick on TikTok and said: Our daughter was an absolute s*** today. Elfie is going to have a little surprise for her when she wakes up. She heads outside the home and picks a pebble from the front garden, painting it black so that it looks like a small piece of coal. Tori then places the coal in a red gt box and hides the Elf doll before including a note that writes: To: DJ For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. In a follow-up video, Tori shows her daughteraposs reaction as she reads out the note: Reindeer DJ, I had to go back to the North Pole to tell Santa how mean you have been. I am sad! Please be good so Santa will bring you lots of presents, see you soon. Love, Elfie. When the girl finds a dirty rock in the box, her dad says: Yeah, bad kid gets coal. Many parents disagreed with Toriaposs idea and said she ruined the Christmas spirit. One wrote: Now it lost its magic because you touched it. A second penned: Great, sheaposs traumatised now. Tori hit back at the mean comments and said: My daughter thought it was hilarious. Iaposm sorry for anyone who took this to heart or had a bad experience with their parents. My baby is loved unconditionally and she knows it.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

which swung in either direction in horrendous conditions.The sides exchanged goals in the first half, with Stuart MacLean reacting quickest in the box after the Baljaffray keeper couldn’t hold a Fraser Talbot shot and the striker scored to net his eleventh goal in eight games.Baljaffray forced a succession of corners near the end of the half and were on level terms when Red Star were only able to partially clear a corner which fell to the away side’s full back and his shot via the aid of a deflection went past young Leon Murphy in the Star goal. -Into the second half and Star could have retaken the lead when Aaron Moore latched onto a drilled cross from strike partner Stuart MacLean, however, his effort was blocked by an excellent save from the Baljaffray number one.The visitors took the lead after  minutes when a cross caused confusion in the Star defence and the Baljaffray forward had the simple task of finishing into an empty net from close range.Star huffed and puffed for an equaliser, however, they were frustrated by excellent goalkeeping until the goal came in fortuitous circumstances after a long ball was nodded past his own keeper by the Baljaffray centre back meaning the sides were level with  minutes to go.Star took the lead with five minutes remaining when Aaron Moore was able to burst clear of the Baljaffray backline and finish well into the far corner to make it -.This should have been enough to see Star over the line but Baljaffray scrambled a late equaliser when Star again failed to clear a free kick and the ball was bundled over the line to see the match end -.Lochgilphead Red Star are on their travels on Saturday November  when they face their toughest test of the season so far as they take on league leaders and title favourites

November .Star stung the hosts at Cowan Park, Barrhead, with an excellent start to the match, forcing a succession of corners before the ever-dangerous Coll McCallum finished after an excellent delivery by Craig Aitken.The visitors doubled their lead after  minutes when Craig Aitken broke clear down the left and finished with an excellent effort into the goalkeeper’s far corner to put Star - ahead.Star were under pressure for much of the remainder of the half but always carried a threat on the break, with Stuart MacLean’s pace causing the home side no end of problems.Into the second half, Arthurlie forced their way back into the match and pulled a goal back after a rare defensive lapse by Star on  minutes. Star failed to clear the danger from a cross and the unfortunate Coll McCallum erted into his own net past Leon Murphy.The Arthurlie equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when winger Sean Ross cut inside before unleashing a spectacular effort into the top corner.The hosts would have been expected to go on and win the game from here but the Star defence remained well-organised and resolute and a fine goalkeeping performance from Leon Murphy ensured the Lochgilphead side ed home with a well-earned point.Star put their unbeaten league record on the line on Saturday November  when they welcome fellow Argyll side Cardross to the Joint Campus G.

They have no control over pricing and stocking policy, which is decided by the board.#Stressing that the supermarket operates a UK pricing policy, a Co-op spokesperson said: #Co-op is committed to serving and supporting its rural communities, conveniently, including areas where other retailers often do not trade due to the increased operational costs.#Like all retailers, Co-op has experienced some patchy disruption to the availability of some products, and it is working with suppliers to re-stock as quickly as possible.#Alongside well-known brands, Co-op#s award-winning own-brand products provide shoppers with choice # delivering quality and value, while also enabling customers and community causes to unlock additional value and benefits through its membership programme.#Mr Bates added: #The Co-op bosses in Manchester need to realise that the Tarbert Co-op and others in rural locations are not convenience stores.

looked to encourage the public to hold firm to their pre-Christmas plans, with the hospitality industry warning it had suffered a ldquoslew of cancellations after Omicron sparked fresh safety fears.Mr Dowden told Sky News: ldquoThe message to people, I think, is fairly straightforward ndash which is: keep calm, carry on with your Christmas plans.ldquoWersquove put the necessary restrictions in

Africa, where the mutation was first detected, has suggested that the iant has ldquosubstantial ability to cause reinfection in people who have previously had Covid.The research, which has not been peer-reviewed, found people who had tested positive for coronavirus could pick up the virus again, potentially causing a wave of infections in those with some prior immunity.It did not say how the iant will behave when spreading in a highly vaccinated population such as the UK, or whether the virus can evade the protection offered by vaccines against severe disease.But experts in the UK believe their research on the impact of booster vaccines could offer hope in the fight against Omicron.vw,vw,px, px\"The CovBoost study found that booster jabs may well offer good protection in the face of

which is read out at the Old Musselburgh Clubrsquos annual commemoration of the battle at its memorial stone near Wallyford.The revised list has some  names it is hoped MSPs will be enlisted to share them with groups and organisations in their communities to give them the chance to research their ancestors.Roger Knox, chairman of the Pinkie Cleugh Battlefield Group, said: ldquoThe names of the fallen at Pinkie, uncovered by David Caldwell, illustrate the wide area of the origin of the force.ldquoExperience of other tapestry constructions has shown that people do show an interest where there is a connection to their own village, estate, family and area.ldquoWe hope that the circulation of the names and places of origin of the fallen will encourage potential stitchers to come forward.Mr Knox said that Colin Beattie, MSP for Midlothian North and Musselburgh, had offered to circulate details amongst colleagues at the Scottish Parliament.Mr Beattie said: ldquoI am delighted to help in this signicant effort and have reached out to my colleagues in Holyrood to ask them to assist using their contacts with local quilting groups.ldquoI am pleased that I have already received several responses and hope that we can establish interest across Scotland to take part in this fantastic project.Designed by Andrew Crummy, the artist behind the Great Tapestry of Scotland and Battle of

whistles from overhead, which mark the arrival of redwings.Redwings are highly sociable ndash it is not uncommon to see them in flocks of hundreds as they roam throughout the country.Their main diet is berries and they seem to display a preference for some types over others it is believed that this is based on the softness and sweetness of the berries.In mild winters you are likely to see large flocks of redwings feasting on their favourites of hawthorns and rowans however, in harsh months they may forage for fruit in gardens or urban areas.Once disturbed, the birds will take off and seek refuge in neighbouring trees or hedges. Alongside eating berries, they also feed on small insects and mealworms.Unlike other members of the thrush family which build nests in the trees, redwings prefer to build their cup-shaped nests on the ground.The nest is usually well hidden in the dense vegetation and made out of grass, mosses and twigs.Most redwings breed in Scandinavia and Iceland, with a small number breeding in the UK, most of which are concentrated in the Scottish Highlands. The population arriving here from Iceland appears slightly darker and bigger and it is treated as the distinct subspecies coburni.Unlike many migratory birds, which remain loyal to their wintering grounds, redwings present a nomadic lestyle ndash driven by food availability, they rarelyto the same place.I have already seen my first redwings in Edinburgh but I am yet to find them in East Lothian this autumn.Last winter in Musselburgh was fabulous! I particularly remember the snowfall in January during a couple of days I took off work. I liked every minute and, despite cold hands and feet, I enjoyed walking along the Esk.At one point, I spotted a buzzard perching on a snowy branchand headed towards it.As soon as I captured the bird of prey, I heard a familiar lsquotseeprsquo call coming from the hedges.I knew the redwings must have been having a lavish meal as the call was getting louder with every step I took, but I could not see them.It amazes me how dficult it is to spot these birds, even though they are medium-sized and always in large groups.I managed to sneak inside the bush and, when I looked up, I saw at least  redwings. The birds were incredibly noisy and constantly on the move. The whole bush was bustling and I felt like I was sitting at the heart of a busy factory!Until now, I found that experience one of the most challenging. It was not easy to operate the camera in such a tight space, with twigs scratching my face the entire time. I did not have a clear view of the birds either, but I could not move as it would spook them!The low winter sun was already disappearing but, eventually, I did manage to find a gap and push the camera through. After taking a few photographs, I decided to head back home.When I ed to the same spot the following day, the redwings were gone.If you have enjoyed my pictures this year and would like to see more, I now have several designs of my WildleCalendars for sale.

extra hour in their daily commute to Edinburgh using the  bus service, which stops at Prestonpans, Wallyford, Musselburgh and Portobello.An online petition launched by Mr Hoy calling for the reinstatement of the service has now received more than  signatures.Mr Hoy said: ldquoIn early October, my office contacted East Coast Buses, who issued a standard response outlining the reasons for continued withdrawal of the service, including challenges with recruitment, the need to prioritise key services and the focus on delivering the  service.ldquoI recognise these challenges, but I also recognise they apply across all routes across the whole of the Lothians and are not confined to the X route.ldquoAfter a number of residents living in Dirleton, Gullane, Aberlady and Longniddry

this up with a third letter to the interim managing director of Lothian Buses.ldquoLothian Buses is owned by the four Lothian council areas, which includes East Lothian Council.

I cant see the situation dramatically changing in the next couple of weeks - we have to watch this space...thats genuinely where we are scientically right now.\": Latest Omicron casein Scotland not connected to othersA total of  cases of the Omicron iant have been confirmed in Scotland so far,including at leastnine which are linked and have been traced back to a single private event held on November .It is unclear whether the three confirmedtoday- two in NHS Lanarkshire and one in the Greater Glasgow area- are linked to this event or separate.One caseidentied in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde region, confirmed on Wednesday, was not linked to that event.The Omicron iant was first detected in Botswana in November and appears to be driving a rapid surge in Covid infections in South Africa, with signs that it is overtaking Delta as the dominant strain.There are concerns that its high number of mutations - including  on the spike protein used by the virus to infect cells - could make it more resistant to current vaccines and immunity.There are signs from Public Health Scotland data that the recent fall in Covid cases stopped on November  with a very small increase in positive cases by November If protection against infection is reduced, however, scientists remain confident that vaccines would still provide a strong defence against serious illness or death - as has already been seen following the emergence of the Delta strain.Prof Bauld said: \"I think we should be worried about Omicron because it really, genuinely does look more transmissible.\"We dont know about disease severity or immune escape from the vaccines, but we have confidence that eventhe vaccines are weakened in terms of transmission and infection that they will still work in terms of saving peoples lives basically. Even these current vaccines that we have.\"So I am worried, but Im not saying that these vaccines are useless - theyre still working and will still work, evennot as well, against Omicron.\": Abnormal spike in neonatal deaths not linked to Covid in mothers orbabiesProf Bauld told podcast listeners that it was \"absolutely imminent\" that boosters will be added to Scotlands vaccine passport apps, allowing people travelling abroad to show that they have had a third jag.Some countries are now requesting proof of boosters for entry as part of border controls, or for access into leisure and hospitality venues.However, Prof Bauld said she was not in favour of tougher rules on arrivals into the UK.The Scottish Government has asked Westminster to consider extending home self-isolation to eight days for travellers arriving from non-red list countries, with people only able to end self-isolationthey test negative for Covid on a PCR test taken on day eight.Currently, all arrivals have to take a PCR test within two days of entering the UK and remain in isolation until they receive a negative result.Prof Bauld said this was \"proportionate\".She added: \"Im really hopeful that we dont go in that direction [eight-day self-isolation] unless we absolutely have to.\"The main reason for that is that when you see domestic spread of this iant, then thinking about travel as the main source becomes less of an issue.\"Its too early to tellthat would occur - governments arent ruling it out - but its not the plan at the moment.\""},{"url":null,"title":"letters-snp-shouldnt-get-excited-one-rogue-poll","story":"Nicola Sturgeon is caught between a rock and a hard place and how she handles this is critical. The SNP was always a party of protest and dissent. Now it is experiencing the real dilemmas such behaviour creates for those in authority.Indyref is still in the melting pot and the manold crises in the NHS are not going away, to say nothing of all the other pressing problems in her in-tray. Ms Sturgeon has ridden her luck for many years now. Is it about to run out Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.* JOHN Dunloplikes to submit short acerbic letters to The Herald, usually with an anti-Scottish independence slant. Perhaps he was a bit premature with his latest effort, given the result of the recent Ipsos-Mori poll showing support for Scottish independence at %. Could it be that the electorate of Scotland really do want to catch up with the rest of the modern world, including Barbados Alec Oattes, Ayr.PARTYS OVER FOR JOHNSONCOME on over to his place,Come on, hes having a party.With loads of booze and plenty of nibbles,Boris is having a party tonight.How very galling, how very Downing Street one rule for us and another for those behind the black door. While we all wearily faced another lockdown last Christmas, after a frightening year, and with the prospect of spending a dismal festive season cut off from family and friends, No  staff were merrily rocking round the clock . Whether he was present or not, the party took place within the Prime Ministers official home and on his watch.Given all of Mr Johnsons gaffes since he took office, perhaps we shouldnt really be surprised at this one, but somehow this latest example of cynical insensitivity and lack of solidarity with the rest of the population really sticks in the craw. Mr Johnson declares that all Covid guidelines were followed, but seems unable to grasp that holding the party at all was a breach of his own rules.The partys over for Mr Johnson it will take him a long time to clear up the mess.Ruth Marr, Stirling.WHATS GREAT ABOUT THE CENTRE MARK Smith claims he identies with Sir Keir Starmer because the Labour leader is \"attempting to steer the Labour Party back to the \"centre\" .Perhaps he could elaborate and tell us the last time the Labour Party was in the \"centre\". The last Labour government which I voted for in  will, in my opinion, forever be associated with the following: its kow-towing to the Bush White House and the oil billionaires which determined its policy its sycophancy towards media moguls and policies which allowed the City of London to run rampant. The upshot of course was the biggest financial collapse in the countrys history and one of the biggest foreign policy disasters in the countrys history.Is this Mr Smiths centre Many people I feel will still be in the dark about what Sir Keir stands for perhaps he has let Mr Smith in on his secret. It is worth remembering that the most effective British politician of the th century did not eschew \"radical and damaging ideologies\". This is what made Mrs Thatcher, loathe her or love her, such a towering figure.Brian Harvey, Hamilton.TOO LATE TO THE PROBLEMSTHE debate in Holyrood on Wednesday on the cases of hospital-acquired infections was enlightening. The main argument from SNP politicians was that they had carried out reviews and acted on the recommendations.Just as with the impact of Storm Arwen, the SNP is always chasing its tail trying to fight fires rather than stopping them starting in the first place.Jane Lax, Aberlour.FOLLOW SWEDEN ON MP STANDARDSANDY Macivers article suggesting paying politicians more to get better service was astonishing. For the last few decades we have heard endless justications for the absurdly-high salaries paid to executives . That has not prevented financial disasters, business failures, scandals and revelations of incompetence and corruption.Mr Maciver should perhaps study the government of Sweden, where politicians do not have official cars and drivers or other privileges. They cannot vote themselves extra money for constituency travel. They live in state-owned apartments in Stockholm but do not get allowances for homes or second homes. They have no way of claiming for duck ponds or moat cleaning.Their tax s are publicly available like most other information.In  the deputy prime minister was sacked because she made a small purchase using a government credit card, despite having already refunded the money.If our politicians received salaries comparable with those paid in Sweden and worked under similar conditions, our government would be more credible. But perhaps Mr Maciver thinks that the UK is already much better managed than Sweden Peter M Dryburgh, Edinburgh.START TREATING US AS ADULTSWHILE there can be little doubt that the new Omicron iant of Covid is cause for concern, it is interesting that we are being given very little information about the state of health of the very few people who are unfortunate enough to have contracted it. Are they seriously ill  Hospitalised  Or only mildly affected We donrsquot actually know, because it would appear that governments across the UK keep this information secret in the belief that giving this information to the public would affect their attitudes towards taking precautions. The general assumption is that we canrsquot be trusted to do the right thing to prevent transmission. Well, after nearly two years of bad decisions by our leaders during which, in general, we have followed their guidance, it may be time to treat us more like adults than children.At the start of the pandemic, most of our leaders stated that there would be an open and honest consultation with the public about measures to control the spread of the disease. It didnrsquot happen then, it hasnrsquot happened since, and it isnrsquot happening now.Dave Henderson, Glasgow.FM HAS AGAIN FAILED TO ACTTEN days after Omicron was detected in Scotland the First Minister has failed to act yet again. Unlike Austria she hasnt made the vaccine compulsory, or made it compulsory for NHS or care workers like in England.Nor has she introduced eight-day isolation for people flying into Scotland despite calling for the UK Government to do it in England.She hasnt led by example by making Holyrood Parliament online again, nor has she banned hospital visits, or shutdown or curfewed pubs and nightclubs like many European countries. In other words, once again she has done nothing but try to sht the blame where. As we head towards , Covid deaths in Scotland by the end of this winter, Nicola Sturgeon should be ashamed.David Watson, Edinburgh.IN THE LINE OF FIREJILL Stephensons letterdisplays a curious lack of knowledge, as her reference to investigations would suggest she has never heard of the presumption of innocence. In her eyes it is quite okay to lambast the SNP over its actions, but not so in relation to Mr Johnsons party. I rarely write about politics, but her letter is nothing to do with politics it is about plumbing the depths of shallowness.I much prefer to write on other matters, such as the recent discussion on the elusiveness of snipe and woodcock. It brought to mind my late fathers account of a shoot in Aberdeenshire. The keeper drew up a line of shooters to walk along the face of a gentle slope, placing the men in descending order of quality, with the best shots at the higher end. Almost at once a snipe arose at the top and flew down the entireof the line, with every man firing at least one shot at it until it reached the last in the line, who downed it. The keeper walked over to pick up the bird and, on holding it aloft, declared: \"Thatll teach ye tae flee stracht.\" We should be glad such a bird exists as otherwise, Army marksmen might have ended up being called woodcockers.George F Campbell, Glasgow.Read more: I can reassure the doubters: vaccines are safer than you are being led to believe"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-kick-off-womens-six-nations-campaign-next-year-england-match","story":"Six Nations organisers have decided to keep the womenrsquos Championship in its own window, whereas previously games were played on the same weekend as the menrsquos senior and under- fixtures.

The gt card is such a lovely present to give someone, giving them the chance to go out and buy from Scottish shops but also to visit Scottish restaurants and cafeacutes, adds Beth. ldquoLast year, like most Scottish restaurants, we were closed and people have really missed the chance to get together and celebrate, to enjoy good food and drink and revel in that time together. ldquoI think we all appreciate that so much this year and donrsquot take it for granted. The South Ayrshire Gt Card is an opportunity for people to experience Scotland again and is so much nicer than giving cash. ldquoShopping and supporting local has always been important, but never so much as now.TREAT YOURSELFHairdressers, barbers, and beauty salons across the country are also among those signing up to accept the new local gt cards in their area. What better way to ensure you look your best for a trip out to enjoy the shops and eateries in your community by first using your card to help you look good and feel great  And,you want to treat someone to a pamper experience this festive season but want to give them the flexibility or where or when to treat themselves, then a gt card may be the perfect solution.FAMILY FUNAnd itrsquos not only on our high streets where we can show our support for local businesses through the Scotland Loves Local Gt Card. There are great days out experiences that we can enjoy through them too. Historic Environment Scotland - which operates some of the nationrsquos most iconic visitor attractions, including Edinburgh Castle - is among those accepting the local cards. Gillian Macdonald, the organisationrsquos head of sales and marketing, said: ldquoWe are delighted to be part of the Scotland Loves Local Gt Card initiative. ldquoAll the sites we have open across the country accept the card on admissions or retail so giving this card will offer the chance to have a great day out at a local historic attraction or can be used on a day away. ldquoWhat a great Christmas Gt for someone.A BRIGHTER FUTUREThe Scotland Loves Local Gt Card has been launched as another way for people to support local businesses and help them recover from the Covid- pandemic. Its rollout is being funded by the Scottish Government as part of the drive for people to choose local, protecting jobs in their community. Delivered by Scotlandrsquos Towns Partnership- the organisation spearheading the Scotland Loves Local campaign - alongside Perth-based fintech Miconex, the programme is the first scheme of its scale in the country, giving every region the opportunity to launch its own local gt card. STP chief officer Phil Prentice says: ldquoThe greatest gt you can give this Christmas is that of local. The Scotland Loves Local Gt Card is the perfect present. ldquoEveryonersquos a winner when we all think, choose and spend local. We can enjoy great experiences while protecting jobs and building a better future.Cards can only be accepted in businesses which have registered as merchants. As well as the Scotland Loves Local Gt Card, the  existing Town  City Gt Card programmes already operated by Miconex in Scotland will remain, with additional promotion for each area.To buy a Scotland Loves Local Gt Card for your region - or to find out how your business can be part of the scheme - go to www.lovelocal.scot."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-six-cases-omicron-linked-steps-concert-glasgow","story":"Nicola Sturgeon warned that public health teams expect to see infections rise \"perhaps signicantly\" in the coming days.Surveillance has traced six cases of Omicron to a Steps concert held at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow on November .: Expert does not expect dramatic change in Covid before ChristmasThe first nine cases identied in Lanarkshire and Greater Glasgow and Clyde had previously being linked to a single private event on November , but several others have since been traced to other sources indicating community transmission of the virus.The First Minister said:ldquoThe number of Omicron cases now being reported in Scotland is rising, and cases are no longer all linked to a single event, but to several dferent sources including a Steps concert at the Hydro on  November.\"This confirms our view that there is now community transmission of this iant within Scotland.\"Given the nature of transmission we would expect to see cases rise - perhaps signicantly - in the days ahead.\"However, health protection teams are continuing work through contact tracing, isolation and testing to slow the spread as far as possible while we learn more about the new iantrsquos impact.

The Golden Mariana has served the communities well, but it’s time now for a younger, more comfortable vessel to take over. At m, with a m beam, the Nordic Sea will be able to carry  passengers and is capable of running at between - knots, which is a little faster than the Golden Mariana. She has stabilisers installed to help with the motion and is a much more luxurious vessel for passengers and, very importantly, is fully accessible for those who require this.”The ship has attracted plenty of speculation, after long periods of being tied up since being purchased in April . COVID delayed a £, refit programme, and further complicating matters has been the retirement of the previous skipper of the Golden Mariana and the longer-than-anticipated recruitment process for crew to serve on the Nordic Sea.Mr Buck went on to explain why the process has taken longer than some had expected.“It would appear to have taken a long time but actually in respect of the certication process when taking a vessel from one country to another it has actually been remarkably quick. She is the first vessel of her type to go through that process and with that comes inevitable hurdles that need to be overcome. The Nordic Sea had a series of modications made to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication standard.“She was built to a dferent specication so had to go through the required checks and balances to ensure we met the current specications for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s current passenger vessel system.”He is confident that she will be a favourable addition to the fleet.“She is a really good sea keeping vessel with good properties designed with the right centre of height for that comfortable ride.”Councillor David Dawson, chair of the board of Orkney Ferries, said: “I would like to recognise the efforts of the team here in Orkney for getting us to this stage, particularly given the challenges added in by the pandemic, but also for the patience of the people of Papay.

We are still hoping for the best and hoping that our developing understanding of this iant will reduce rather than increase our concern.“I very much hope that additional protections can be avoided and while we will act on a precautionary basis, we will always seek to act out at all times in a proportionate manner.”Research is still being undertaken on the Omicron iant — which was first discovered in southern Africa — but early indications are that it might be more transmissible than the dominant Deltra strain.However, she did say that there was no evidence that the symptoms of Omicron was dferent from Delta and the disease caused is any dferent.Scientists are also working to establish what impact this new iant will have on the effectiveness of vaccines.New recommendations are set to come from the joint committee on vaccination and immunisationis set to be announced this afternoon, and this will guide the Scottish Government on the shape of the booster programme.Ms Sturgeon said that evencurrent vaccines were less effective against the new iant, that was not the same as no effectiveness, and urged more people to come forward and become double vaccinated.She also urged travel restrictions to be tightened and called on a four nations approach in order to prevent the importation of the virus from abroad.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As the trust’s chairman Dan Wise explained, it is essentially an underwater drone.He said: “This small unit will allow us to continue our collaborative research into the Orkney skate population. More specically, we will be able to get eyes underwater to look for essential fish habitat such as egg case laying grounds, nursery areas etc.“We can cover more ground with this drone when compared to ing, and the quality of the camera is greater when compared to a drop down camera – both survey styles we still do but this is another tool in the tool box.”RSPB Scotland is also going to invest in new machinery, with its £, award going to the purchase of a specialist tractor for removing vegetation.A tractor equipped with Soucy tracks will be used to cut and collect material for removal from the sites, without leaving rutted tracks or creating erosion points. This machine has signicantly less ground pressure than a normal tractor, reducing the chances of damaging sensitive habitats, and is specically designed to operate in softer ground conditions.The benefits to birdle include opening up foraging habitat, allowing flightless chicks to move around more easily, and reducing the chance of chicks becoming saturated in dense, wet vegetation.RSPB Scotland site manager in Orkney, Alan Leitch, said:“The funding means we can purchase machinery that offers us a real opportunity to upscale our annual land management efforts on the Orkney nature reserves to increase conservation benefits. These operations will help a suite of species including curlews, lapwings, and hen harriers.”The £m fund was launched in July this year and has now been extended to a total of at least £m over the next five years. On the fund in general, the Bioersity Minister, Lorna Slater, said:“Too much of Scotland’s natural environment is degraded after years of over-exploitation, but this government is committed to restoring nature and our wildle. The Nature Restoration Fund will play a big role in delivering these aspirations, and the projects we are funding today are just the beginning.#The fund kick starts a new approach, supporting longer-term, larger, landscape-scale projects across Scotland # on land and at sea # that address the twin crises of bioersity loss and climate change. Over this parliament we will invest at least £ million through the fund, delivering real change that people and nature will benefit from across the whole country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Although folk must still enter via the south nave side door, once inside the cathedral, everyone will be able to enjoy the new glazed timber vestibule.Meredith Macbeth, St Magnus Cathedral#s historical buildings conservator, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the work so far and the new vestibule truly enhances the entryway of this wonderful building. The works are not entirely complete as the curved glass has been delayed by the supplier in Europe due to COVID, Brexit and other supply issues, but we are expecting it early . So for now the area will remain roped off from the public, but it is a delight to see the new vestibule settling in and the excited response by those who know the building so well.”Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “The cathedral really is the gt that keeps on giving to the people of Orkney and further afield.#What a beautul addition to what is a very special building. I look forward to seeing the complete, finished product which is sure to be absolutely stunning.”Elaine Grieve from the Society of the Friends of St Magnus Cathedral, who are making a substantial contribution to the costs of the work, said: “The Cathedral is so precious that it is hard to contemplate making any changes for fear they won’t do the building justice.#However, in this case, what an absolutely wonderful transformation the vestibule has made to the entrance of the building. The craftmanship is outstanding and we now have an addition which befits this treasured building loved by so many near and far.”The cathedral#s stonework also enjoyed a facelt recently.Conservation works included repointing stonework with lime mortar on the interior and exterior of the west door. Samples of original lime mortars were found deep in the constructions joints of the building and were analysed by the Scottish Lime Centre in Fe. An appropriate mix was specied, to match in manner of strength, colour and aggregate size.For anyone wishing to visit there are signs directly through the side gate, please be mindful of the restrictions in place in regards to the pandemic such as the wearing of masks and social distancing while inside.St Magnus Cathedral is managed by OIC on behalf of the people of Orkney. Casey Construction Ltd. was awarded the contract to carry out the essential maintenance work and improvements.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

raising the alarm about the risks associated with gathering for social events.Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden said his party had no intention of cancelling its own Christmas drinks, and others should continue with their celebrations.His remarks came as figures showed Covid- infections have increased in all four UK nations and remain close to record levels, though the latest rise is not linked to the arrival of the Omicron iant.Around one in  people in private households in England had Covid- in the week to November , up from one in  the previous week, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics .The proportion of people in England who were estimated to have coronavirus at the peak of the second wave in early January was one in .This led to a surge in hospital admissions and deaths, along with a nationwide lockdown.In Wales, around one in  people is estimated to have had Covid- in the week to November , up from one in  the previous week and slightly below the recent record high of one in .In Northern Ireland, the latest estimate is also one in , up from one in  the previous week and slightly below the record of one in  in mid-August.For Scotland, the latest estimate is one in , up from one in  the previous week but below Septemberrsquos peak of one in . vw,vw,px, px\"Meanwhile, No  said any staff parties held at Downing Street in the run-up to Christmas would be ldquoprivate events that would not be publicly announced.Askedhe would inform reportersthere were plans for a Christmas party for staff, the Prime Ministerrsquos spokesman said: ldquoObviously, events that happen in No  that are private events, we wouldnrsquot inform you.ldquoWe obviously wouldnrsquot set out details of private s in No  but, as I say, there will be festive events in the run-up to Christmas.It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who received his booster dose of the Covid vaccine on Thursday, urged the public to ldquocontinue as they are within the new measures introduced to stop the spread of the virus, following the emergence of the Omicron iant.Senior Tories, including Health Secretary Sajid Javid, have looked to encourage the public to hold firm to their pre-Christmas plans, with the hospitality industry warning it had suffered a ldquoslew of cancellations after Omicron sparked fresh safety fears.Mr Dowden told Sky News: ldquoThe message to people, I think, is fairly straightforward ndash which is: keep calm, carry on with your Christmas plans.ldquoWersquove put the necessary restrictions in place, but beyond that keep calm and carry on.The former culture secretary said he understood there were ldquoconcerns about the Omicron iant of coronavirus, but argued the Government had put in place ldquosufficient measures, such as reinstating rules around wearing face coverings in shops and on public transport, in response.ldquoPeople should continue with their plans as intended, Mr Dowden said, as he encouraged people to take up the offer of a booster jab.Asked about the Toriesrsquo own party plans, he told BBC Breakfast: ldquoI think it is still planned, and I donrsquot intend to cancel it as chairman of the Conservative Party.Medical experts have struck a more cautious tone, however, urging people to avoid large groups this winter.Influential scientist Professor Peter Openshaw said he would not feel comfortable attending a party as the ldquochances of getting infected were too high.Prof Openshaw, a member of the Governmentrsquos New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group , told BBCrsquos Question Time: ldquoPersonally, I wouldnrsquot feel safe going to a party at the moment,it involves being indoors in an enclosed space where yoursquore close to other people, and people are not wearing masks.ldquoEventheyrsquove been tested and vaccinated, I wouldnrsquot feel safe.The British Medical Associationsaid people should be encouraged to ldquoavoid large groups and meet outdoors where possible over the festive period.The debate over social gatherings comes as scientists continue to study the possible threat posed by Omicron.A study in South Africa, where the mutation was first detected, has suggested that the iant has ldquosubstantial ability to cause reinfection in people who have previously had Covid.The research, which has not been peer-reviewed, found people who had tested positive for coronavirus could pick up the virus again, potentially causing a wave of infections in those with some prior immunity.It did not say how the iant will behave when spreading in a highly vaccinated population such as the UK, or whether the virus can evade the protection offered by vaccines against severe disease.But experts in the UK believe their research on the impact of booster vaccines could offer hope in the fight against Omicron. vw,vw,px, px\"The CovBoost study found that booster jabs may well offer good protection in the face of the iant.A team studying the effects of third doses said the bodyrsquos T cell immune response after a booster shot is such that it may provide protection from hospital admission and death.The study also backs up the UKrsquos decision to offer Pfizer or Moderna as a third shot, with mRNA jabs leading to the most signicant rise in immunity levels.Professor Saul Faust, trial lead and director of the NIHR Clinical Research Facility at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, said the vaccines worked well against existing iants, although Omicron was not tested in the study.Asked specically about Omicron, he said: ldquoOur hope as scientists is that protection against hospitalisation and death will remain intact.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place

Last night was the first night.”“I went down on Monday and there was no mention of it. You used to get a  per cent discount.”He added: “I was totally surprised. I only booked my ticket a week or so ago. I wasn’t advised, and it doesn’t seem astheir crew was advised – I did query it with them.”Serco NorthLink’s commercial director Jim Dow said: “We are proud to offer an extensive food and drink menu on board that is very reasonably priced and equal for all passengers.“Our commitment to working with local suppliers continues and we are proud to showcase those partnerships. “While the Islander discount code is no longer in place, all passengers do have access to a iety of choices and price points.”A classic example of where profits are more important than the service Serco gives. Despite it being a leline service, Serco obviously see#s this as an oppertunity to profit from this by penalising islanders regardless. I would suggest people take onboard a lunch box, which would probably be cheaper, on their next trip down south. ...Ryan Taylor has worked as a reporter since , and has been at The Shetland Times since , covering a wide iety of news topics.Before then he reported for other newspapers in the Highlands, where he was raised, and in Fe, where he began his career with DC Thomson.

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4283615.jpg--.jpg?1638527740000\n","title":"demand high for booster jabs says trust","story":"The Seven Towers Mass Vaccination Centre is open for booster jabs for those aged over  group as per Department of Health guidance.

She has also separately raised issues with her employer.The statement from Ms Donaghy’s solicitor said she is “deeply concerned” about “systemic leakage of confidential Council decision making to the media and other third parties”.“The latest instance of such leaks relates to a password protected confidential email communication sent to Councillors confirming a decision on her suspension,” KRW Law added.“Within a very short time of her receiving formal correspondence about her suspension the decision was posted on social media.”The statement added that throughout this situation “she has retained her dignity in the face of often heavy media intrusion into her family and private le”.“To date there has been zero accountability on the part of the Council on the manner in which it has conducted itself on a series of issues all of which are the subject of pending disciplinary and other proceedings,” it added.Mid and East Antrim Borough Council said in a statement: “We do not comment on staffing matters and no inference should be drawn from this.”Meanwhile, the DUP group leader on Mid and East Antrim Borough Council has claimed that the Food Standards Agency is to fund the employment of  Environmental Health Officers implementing checks associated with the Northern Ireland Protocol at Larne Port for three years.Councillor Gregg McKeen said he was disappointed at the development.“No amount of money offered by the Food Standards Agency will persuade us to comply with the damaging dictate of the Northern Ireland Protocol,” he said.“Apart from anything , this offer provides no guarantee for the ratepayers of Mid and East Antrim who could be left with a staggering bill for the long term, continued employment of these officers.“As committed to by the leaders of unionism in the Joint Declaration on Ulster Day, I am calling on UUP and TUV councillors to back us in opposing and rejecting the Foods Standards Agency’s lure of additional monies.”In response, Maria Jennings, FSA NI Director, said: “The Food Standards Agency’s priority is to ensure high standards of food safety and consumer protection. We are working with partners in government to determine the impacts of the Northern Ireland Protocol and supporting District Councils with the implementation of controls currently required within NI food law.“Funding for these controls is provided by the Department of Finance, facilitated by the Food Standards Agency.“District Councils with designated ports are legally responsible for carrying out checks on certain foods so that people in Northern Ireland can continue to enjoy a wide range of safe products.”Most ReadSuspended Mid and East Antrim chief Anne Donaghy to take legal action against councilTUV Lagan Valley candidate Dr William Kitchen considering legal action over Twitter post‘Mark Simpson, BBC News, in the freezing cold water at Helen’s Bay...’NI school funds ‘used inappropriately’ and teachers unhappy over ‘culture of fear’Covid ‘no joking matter’ says DUP’s Donaldson over Wilson ‘ding dong’ tweetTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution ringsPlayArray Collective are announcedTurner Prize winners after Belfast group dominate shortlistLatest Northern IrelandPalestinian doctor charged over dissident activity faces delay in legal fight to be released from custodyCovid- infections rise in all UK nations – but no link to OmicronThree arrested over death of woman in Co DownWomen in Media Belfast: new group’s inaugural gathering draws a large attendanceSteven BeacomOpinionIrish League mid-term report - Linfield still the team to beat but it should be win or bust for Mick McDermott at GlentoranLatestPalestinian doctor charged over dissident activity faces delay in legal fight to be released from custodyCelebrated stage and screen actor Sir Antony Sher diesCovid- infections rise in all UK nations – but no link to OmicronMother of murder accused still has nightmares about her son’s attack, court toldWilliam records audio walking tour for Apple,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ruby Tandoh adores a Yorkshire pudding       “My favourite side dish has to be the Yorkshire pudding,” says Tandoh, author of new cookbook, Cook As You Are. “Whether or not it’s strictly canon depends on who you’re speaking to, but I can’t imagine a better vessel for mopping up gravy. It’s the perfect counterpoint to the meaty savouriness of the Christmas dinner plate.” . Gordon Ramsay has very specic thoughts on stuffing      “Stuffing’s something that people think needs to be stuffed in the cavity of the turkey – that’s the worst place to cook a stuffing. It’s not good in there. There’s a reason why you don’t put much in that cavity,” says Ramsay, whose new recipe collection, Ramsay In , is out now.“To make a really good stuffing is something I do separately. And so, I get the ground sausage, the pork, the beef. And then from there we’ll put in some smoked pancetta, some beautully roasted pistachios, some chopped up apricot and bake it in the tray prior. And then as it comes out, we’ll add some resting juices from the turkey and let it sit and absorb.” . Donal Skehan appreciates the humble Brussels sprout…     “Brussels sprouts are my favourite. I love them every way,” say Irish chef Skehan, author of Everyday Cook. “I love them as a salad as well. Very much a winter salad – in a food processor, bag of sprouts, straight down the chute into the chopper, mix it together with some really good chunks of Pecorino cheese, and some dried cranberries or even pomegranate, would be lovely. And then just a light dressing and some nuts maybe as well, something to crunch, toasted walnuts would be nice. Youmix that together and it’s like a Brussel’s sprout slaw, but it is stunning.” . Same goes for River Cottage’s Lucy Brazier       “Sprouts with chestnuts, because I think that tastes like Christmas,” says food writer Lucy Brazier, whose new cookbook, Christmas at River Cottage, is all about the festive food season. “I could eat a bowl of that without anything .” . Gino D’Acampo gets excited about the roasted veg       “I’m a huge roasted vegetable fan at Christmas,” says the chef, celebrating his new series and cookbook, Gino’s Italian Family Adventure. “We do them with balsamic vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, parsley, a few capers, all these – amazing. Funnily enough I do like stuffing, because what is stuffing, sausage with herbs and a bit of bread  Very tasty, I like that. I hate Turkey. I don’t like turkey.” . James Martin has a buttery way with carrots       Chef James Martin loves carrots cooked in butter – Butter being the title of his new cookbook. He does them “in a style of Vichy – Vichy is a town in the south of France. They cook everything in mineral water, sugar, butter and salt to produce this amazing taste, butyou use the addition of star anise it makes carrots taste amazing.” . Mary Berry champions the good old celeriac       “I love celeriac,” says Mary Berry . “I just cook it until it’s soft. It’s knobbly. If you grow it, it doesn’t come to fruition until November. You can buy it earlier. And I cook it until it’s tender then add full-fat cregraveme fresh to it and puree it. It is delicious. It reheats well.” She also makes chestnut stuffing. “I do them the day before and I do it in small shapes and fry them, then all I’ve got to do is reheat them.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

And they’re not alone – the research found a thirdof grandparents buy unsuitable gts for grandchildren at Christmas, closely followed by aunties , distant relativesand friends .  By asking yourself a few simple questions you can nail the art of gt-giving to both children and adults, promises Kim Brookes, who ran an online gt-registry for more than  years.   Have kids so that instead of real gts you can give friends and family novelty photo items with pictures of your children they saw on social media  months ago. — Some Boys MotherDecember ,    “Now’s the time to show your family just how much you love them by way of the perfect gt,” she says. “This is an opportunity not to be squandered, but one that causes a lot of stress at this time of year, as we really want to get it right.” Brookes, who now runs the natural scent jewellery brand, Perfino, suggests people choosing gts ask themselves these questions… . Do they really need it   Think about the person you’re buying for. You want to give them something that’s meaningful, not just for Christmas. Something that won’t be part of the re-gting cycle any time soon. So, it needs to be something they really want, rather than a short-term fad. “Subscriptions are a good option for this,” says Brookes. “Perhaps a comic or magazine – a gt that reminds them of you every month.” . Just because you love it, does that mean they will  Remember who you’re buying for and always keep their tastes and preferences at the forefront of your mind. “They may not want the chemistry set when their favourite subject is art, or the history book when they love nothing better than a murder mystery,” stresses Brookes.  . Have you really put proper thought into it  Don’t rush to buy something just because it’s there, without giving any thought to the person you’re buying for, says Brookes. “This is the worst offence,” she insists, “as it shows little consideration. Try to find some time to think long and hard about the child or person you’re buying for, and you’ll know what’ll make them happy, evenit’s not to your taste. Thankfully we’re all dferent.” . Have you gone too big    Brookes points out that while a gt recipient might love a trip to an adventure park for Christmas, and be a bit put out with a stick of deodorant, you’ll have a sense of what’s right. “And be very careful not to escalate,” she warns, “as you’ll be digging a hole for yourself on future gting occasions.” . Is it really eco-friendly  This question now has to be at the front of everyone’s minds, for your own satisfaction as well as the good of the planet, says Brookes. “I find the easiest way to do this is to trust who you’re buying from,” she says. “Most businesses will now put their eco credentials front and centre and,they don’t, look for one that does. Once you trust them, you can buy with an easy conscience.” . Have they already got it  If a potential gt is new and super-popular, it’s possible your gt recipient may already have it. If the gt’s for your own child, there’s a chance someone  may have bought it for them. “The best way forward could be to make some subtle enquiries,” advises Brookes, “andyou take the leap and buy, at least keep the receipt and be upfront about how happy you’d be to facilitate an exchange.”  . Are consumables a good choice   “We have so much at this time of year, so I’d avoid more chocolate, more sweets, more of anything unless it’s an extra-special treat – something they wouldn’t normally have, but which you know they’d enjoy,” suggests Brookes. . Are smellies always a winner  Smelly oils, creams etc may work for older children, teenagers and adults – but onlyyou know they like that sort of thing, warns Brookes, who says that, again, such items need to be really special to be a good gt. “Bath oil is my favourite thing,” she says, “but obviously it’s not for someone who only takes showers.” . Is it really appropriate  Consider whether something is age-appropriate for children and, of course, avoid anything made from plastic, stresses Brookes. .

It opened earlier this week and seeks to gain insights from stakeholders and the wider public on the best way to shape and develop the rail network across Ireland. Mr Durkan has encouraged local people and businesses to have their say by responding to the consultation. He said: “This public consultation is an exciting opportunity for everyone to have their say on the future of rail provision across Ireland. “This island once had a thriving railway network and since coming into office SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has committed to exploring an expanded railway network, which has the potential to be transformative for communities across our island. “The benefits of an overhaul of our current railway network are clear, it would allow us to address the regional imbalances that exist across the island, making our communities better connected and making rail a real option for people who regularly travel for work, to visit friends and family and to socialise. “It would also bring a boost for our economy, with poor public transport links regularly cited as a reason for the lack of investment outside our population centres. “More public transport options would also take more cars off our roads, which is a key part of plans to tackle the climate crisis and protect our environment. “I welcome SDLP Minister Mallon’s work on progressing this project so far and hope this public consultation marks the next step in making the revolution of our island’s rail network a reality. “I know this an issue many people in Derry feel very passionate about and would urge them not to miss this unique opportunity to give their view. “While other political parties are busy politicking, the SDLP is focused on delivering for people. After almost  years of Sinn Feacutein-DUP joint Government, the public deserve delivery. We’re up for the job.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

My whole le came to a halt.Derry Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch aims to raise more awareness and funds for an “illness we don’t talk about enough” Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseReporter: Nicole Lang Dec   addthis, Leslie Hill was sadly diagnosed with Parkinsons disease in April . googletag.cmd.push Parkinsons disease is a condition that affects the brain. It causes problems like shaking and stfness that get worse over time. The main symptoms of the disease are shaking, slow movements and stfness. Treatments for Parkinsons disease include therapies to help with movement problems, medicines and sometimes brain surgery. Parkinsons disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain. It’s not yet clear exactly why this happens. Leslie’s first symptoms were shown in his handwriting when it was still neat but very small. Then, in January , the -year-old, was getting ready to go to the dentist when his left hand would not move to brush his teeth. Leslie said: “After several attempts to brush my teeth, I realised something wasnt right. I contacted my GP and was sent to the hospital to do tests. “I was kept in for five days and had numerous tests. It was then that I was diagnosed. My whole le came to a halt. “Shortly after, I became a member of Parkinsons Foyle branch. I really enjoyed and appreciated the support that I got. “I helped to organise events and helped with fundraising. I was a committee member within six months and then I was asked to become Chairman. “It is and was such an honour, I was very pleased to be voted in. I have a vice chairman, Jackie Brolly. “There is a committee of  dedicated members, nothing is a bother to them. My we Rhonda is the secretary and Wendy Stuart is treasurer. “We have approximately  members and we are all one big family. “I have been acting Chairman since September  and officially since March . During my time as Chairman, we have given approximatelyfive to six thousand pounds every year to Parkinson’s research.” Parkinson’s Foyle Branch is a self-funded charity and they depend on the generosity of members of the public to keep the branch going. Their mission is ‘Together we will find a cure, and improve le for everybody affected by Parkinson’s.’ Leslie continued: “We’re close to major breakthroughs. Funding the right research into the most promising treatments, we get closer to a cure every day. “Until then, were here for everyone affected by Parkinson’s. Fighting for fair treatment and better services. Making everyone see its real impact. “People with Parkinson’s, scientists and supporters, fundraisers and families, carers and clinicians, all working side by side. “We are impatient for change, we’re taking a stand, speaking out, chipping in, and playing our part. “I cannot thank the members of the public enough as they have been tremendous. We also organise events with the money we receive to help Parkinson’s patients. “This includes dancing to music, exercise classes, massage and reflexology classes, yoga and many more as exercise is a good medicine for Parkinsons sufferers. “In the month of March, we hold our Annual General Meeting. Then, from April to December, we have monthly meetings. “At our meetings,we have  plus members and carers and we have a guest at every one of them. “Our meetings came to a halt in March  due to the Covid pandemic, the whole world had stopped due to this deadly virus. “With our dedicated committee members, we rang round all of our members and kept in touch. The Mayor of Derry and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke is attending the Foyle Branch’s Christmas Dinner on Friday December  to celebrate all the member’s efforts during this dficult period. Leslie concluded: “I want to speak about and raise awareness for Parkinson’s because you don’t see a lot about it on the news and not many people know about this illness but, together, we will beat Parkinson’s.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

He received a voucher from Travel Solutions for a holiday package from City of Derry Airport to the Algarve next summer, including seven nights accommodation at the Ouratlantico Apartments in Albufeira. It was part of a raffle held on the night, with all proceeds going to the Mayors charity – Foyle Down Syndrome Trust. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, congratulated Michael on claiming the fantastic getaway and thanked Travel Solutions for their support. Mayor Warke said: We had such an amazing evening at the Mayors Charity Christmas Night and it was the perfect ending to present this incredible star prize of a holiday away to Portugal to our winner, Michael Daly. I want to congratulate him, and Id also like to say a massive thank you to Travel Solutions for their generosity and kindness in supplying this prize and, in turn, supporting Foyle Down Syndrome Trust. We raised a lot of money for this very worthwhile cause. Over the last two years I know there are many people who have missed the chance to get away on a nice holiday, so thanks again to Travel Solutions for their support and I hope that Michael enjoys his sunny stay in The Algarve next summer. Julie Magill, Operations Director at Travel Solutions, said: We would like to thank the Mayor for allowing us the opportunity to support his fund raising activities for the Foyle Down Syndrome Trust. We are proud to be part of this great night. Steve Frazer, Managing Director at City of Derry Airport, added: Its an honour to be involved with this inspiring event and in providing support for Foyle Down Syndrome Trust, an organisation at the heart of our local community in the North West. We are delighted to join with our partner, Travel Solutions, in offering this amazing holiday package, as well as our airline partner, Loganair, who have been so kind, as always, in also offering a flight prize to support this worthy cause.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  One hundred years ago this week, the Anglo-Irish Treaty to determine the future of Ireland and its relationship with the United Kingdom was signed at Downing Street after tense negotiation. The final outcome would have profound consequences for the city of Derry who would find itself relegated to border town status once the creation of the Northern Irish state loyal to the UK had been established. The Irish negotiators in London were Arthur Grfiths, Michael Collins, Robert Barton, Eamonn Duggan and George Gavan Duffy. On the British side was David Lloyd George, Lord Birkenhead, Austen Chamberlain, Winston Churchill, Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, Sir Gordon Hewart and Sir Hamar Greenwood. What followed was the creation of the Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Empire. The British would also retain use of three ports – Berehaven and Spike Island in the south and Lough Swilly in Co. Donegal. A common assumption was this Treaty resulted in the partition of Ireland with six counties being formed as Northern Ireland and would remain part of the United Kingdom. However, partition had already been put into place on paper with the Government of Ireland Act in  with it taking effect on May , . All the Anglo-Irish Treaty did was give the devolved, and predominantly unionist government of Northern Ireland the option to opt out of being part of the new Irish Free State – which they duly exercised. But partition was not an idea born out of a hurried idea to provide a compromised or botched solution to the Irish Question. As Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University reveals, the seeds of it had been sown long before Michael Collins sat down to negotiate with Lloyd George. He said: “One hundred years ago, the issue of partition was on everyones minds in Derry and the North West. “It was first mentioned in the nineteenth century as a solution to, what was called at the time, The Irish Question – the idea that Ireland would be self-governing. “Obviously there was major opposition to that in Ulster from the unionist population. So the idea that partition may be a solution with Ulster being under Westminsters control while the rest of Ireland would be under a Dublin government really began to have an affect on Derry in the early part of the twentieth century. “Especially around the years  and  when Ulster unionism began to mobilise physically in terms of protests, the formation of the Ulster Volunteer Forceand the signing of the Ulster Covenant. “That really had a major impact on the North West – and Derry in particular. There was an eleven-year period then from  to  where partition was in the position that kind of like Brexit is today in that in the last five years or so it was the only thing that people were thinking about. “It did have an acute effect on Derry – particularly around  and , Derry was the centre of attention for the partition question because it was seen as the place most likely to see violence emerge as a result of those political discussions. “But of course everything changed following the outbreak of the First World War. After the war, isions became even more entrenched and violence became a reality instead of just a prospect.” While the British Government continued to hesitate over Home Rule for Ireland, Republican volunteers took matters into their own hands in  by launching the Easter Rising. Ultimately, this attempt to win independence from the British failed and the rebellion was crushed. However, the question of self-determination did not end with the execution of the risings leaders and a growing political force by the name of Sinn Feacutein more than made its mark with a stunning performance at the  General Election. The party went from only having six seats to  – including the constituency of Derry City. Dr Grant added: “The thing about the Derry parliamentary seat is that it was a swing seat – a bit like today with the Fermanagh and South Tyrone Westminster seat. “The Derry City seat was so contentious because most men had a vote in parliamentary elections but not in local elections – an issue that remained controversial right up to the early s. “With the parliamentary vote, nationalists and unionists were evenly split in terms of the voting rights in the city. So election results tended to go unionist-nationalist-unionist-nationalist throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century. “So it wasnt a huge surprise when Sinn Feacutein won it in . But at the same time, it was always very close and there was huge media attention on it because it was so close. “The big thing in  was that the Irish Parliamentary Partyand Sinn Feacutein made a pact in Ulster that meant Derry was kind of pre-decided almost for Sinn Feacutein. “The IPP pulled back and gave Sinn Feacutein a free run at Derry but they would have got free runs themselves where such as West Belfast for example when Sinn Feacutein pulled out there. “Cardinal Michael Logue – who was the Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland – brokered a pact between Sinn Feacutein and the IPP as they were afraid that they would knock each other out in seats like Derry and West Belfast and let the Unionists in to sweep up the seats.”  Read more: When unionists lost control of Derry Ground shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  With Sinn Feacuteins electoral success in the Derry City seat in  General Election, nationalists turned their eyes on local government. The running of affairs within Derry had been in the control of Protestants Unionists since the days of when King James II unsuccessfully laid siege to the city in . However, the introduction of a proportional electoral system for council elections had been introduced prior to the  local government poll – the result of which was seismic for Derry. A coalition of Sinn Feacutein, the Nationalist Party and an independent Nationalist councillor, Hugh ODoherty, won control of Derry Council from the Unionists by just two seats with ODoherty himself being appointed Mayor of the city. Not surprisingly, the result caused resentment amongst the Protestant and unionist community which spiralled into the Derry riots of June . Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University said: “The riots of  in the city are interesting in that while partition had been on peoples minds, serious violence had not occurred in the city since  .   “The  election was signicant in that it was a landslide for Sinn Feacutein and the whole country changed politically. So there was a fear on the part of unionists of an independent Ireland. “But to my mind, the most signicant thing was the  local elections in January of that year. “The unionist minority in Derry had held control of the city since the siege in . So theyve had two hundred or so years of dominance. “Because of the introduction of proportional representation, for the first time ever, the nationalists and Sinn Feacutein took control over local government after winning a combined majority of just two. “That in turn meant the Mayor of Derry, Hugh ODoherty, was both a nationalist and the first Catholic to hold that position since . So that was a hugely signicant and symbolic event because it meant that control of local government had been taken out of the hands of unionists and into those of nationalists. “That was hugely important politically because all of the conversation in ,  and into  was about would there be partition  andthat was to happen, where would the line be drawn . “If Derry Corporation was under nationalist control, then the propaganda victory and the moral argument would have tipped the balance towards the argument that Derry should be a Free State city rather than a Northern Irish one. “So unionists were very nervous and scared of their futures because of those signicant changes that took place. Weekend by weekend throughout the year, there was violence, rioting and fighting in the streets that became more and more intense. “You had events in the south with IRA attacks and counter-attacks from the Black and Tans that made things in Derry even more intense and then it all kicked off one night in June . “It spiralled from the Diamond into the Fountain area followed by a counter-attack from the Bogside and by the end of the week, there were twenty people dead – a really, really terrible week in the citys history.”  Read more: Derry the centre of attention in Partition question Ground shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

This week marks the centenary of The Anglo-Irish Treaty that would see Derry in a precarious position in its bid to be part of the new Irish Free StateReporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, This week marks the th anniversary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish Treaty. In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  The riots that took place in Derry in  eventually came to a close but tensions in the city were still on a powderkeg. While Sinn Feacutein held the Derry City Westminster constituencyand a Nationalist coalition in control of both the citys Council and the Mayors office, events where would decide the future of Derrys fortunes. Partition of the Ireland had been an idea since the nineteenth century but it became a reality late in  with the Government of Ireland Act. The bill meant that six of Irelands counties would form the state of Northern Ireland to be run by a devolved – and predominantly unionist – administration in Belfast. May  saw the enforcement of the Act and it left Derry cut off from the rest of Ireland – especially from the trade it had with neighbouring Co. Donegal. Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University said: “Partition – on paper – took place as a result of the Government of Ireland Act in . That piece of legislation allowed for the creation of two separate parliaments of two politically jurisdictions – Northern Ireland in the six counties and Southern Ireland in the  counties. “Northern Ireland was founded with the unionist political establishment ran the legislation to establish a parliament, set up a police force and put into place the whole mechanisms of a government.  Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University  “Whereas in the south, the whole concept of there being a Southern Ireland never really took hold because it wasnt accepted by nationalists or Sinn Feacuteiners as a solution to the issue. “So essentially, the Government of Ireland Act was just ignored. The Southern Irish parliament was never founded which meant the  counties were in a state of limbo while Northern Ireland was being founded. “It was only when the Treaty negotiations took place that the concept of the Free State of Ireland came into play. “Though it had taken place on paper, actual partition didnt take place until after the Free State had been founded. “With the partition on paper, the news of that did not go down well at all with Derrys nationalist community. “I think that once that happened, it was just a matter for them to try and keep their heads down and use the power that they had gained in the local elections earlier in  to try and argue for Derry to be included in the southern jurisdiction. “There was a twin-strategy. The ultimate outcome would be a united Ireland that was independent – whether it would be a republic or not would be another point. There was a feeling that the IRA and Sinn Feacutein could achieve their aims and there would be no worries about partition and treat it asit was something to be ignored. “Others probably more realistically thought that partition was going to happen whatever the outcome was. For those nationalists and republicans, their strategy was to argue forcefully in the press and in the political circles for Derry to be included in the southern jurisdiction. “They went out mapping, interviewing people throughout the potential border area to ask their opinion on where they would like to reside and put out the message that Derry was a nationalist city and should not be included in Northern Ireland. “They also wanted to keep control of local government so they could continue to make that point.” While nationalists in Derry went about arguing their case, Michael Collins himself was planning a campaign of destabilisation to collapse the new Northern Ireland and have Derry and the North within the Free States fold. However, events close to home would prevent that. A turn that would have profound consequences on Derry for decades to come.  The second and final part of “Derry and the Anglo-Irish Treaty”, will be in next Mondays edition of The Derry News on December .

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is one and he makes his way inside Derrys Walls where he comes across an unscrupulous fake Santa Claus looking to use him to fleece the citys Christmas shoppers out of their cash. Robert,  and originally from Doagh in East Antrim, admitted the story started when he was making up a bedtime tale for his children and from there it grew into something more. He said: “Im not an author by profession although I have written other things. This is my first childrens story.  The author of a new childrens novel set in Derry, Sled Down!, Robert Campbell  “I have three young boys – Boyd , Henryand Adamand it was really a story that I told the children at bedtime and then I just sort of wrote it up properly and then published it. “The children seemed to enjoy my story. Generally they would give a pretty honest reaction on what they really think. Sothey enjoyed it, then maybe other children would too. “Without giving too much away about the plot, Santas elves have taken the sled out for a test run right before Christmas. “They have been messing about on the Foyle and have crashed the sled. “The animal children in the book get summoned by their headteacher, who has heard what has happened, to go and round up the loose reindeer and help get the sled back to their school in Culmore. “Meanwhile, around Derrys walls, there is a character who is a  Santa Claus and hes not very nice. “Hes managed to get a hold of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer himself and sets up a scheme to get people to have their picture taken with Rudolph for five pounds a go. “With Rudolph, the idea came about of where would he have gone to  following the sled crashing. “The bad Santa is not based on anyone in particular. Hes not really that bad except he is a bit of a chancer. Hes also up to a couple of other things that would not be classed as being environmentally friendly. “All the book is set in Derry. The walls get a mention as do the bridges where the elves are messing about with the sled. Culmore of course is mentioned as thats where the childrens school is. “Without giving too much away, like most Christmas tales, the day is saved by the children – although the real Santa makes an appearance as well.” Robert has been living in Derry for close to the last  years and admits that by setting the book in the city, he is paying homage to it. He added: “Im not actually from Derry myself. Im a blow-in from Doagh – near Ballyclare – in East Antrim. “My we is from Derry and Ive been living here for eleven or twelve years now. The book is probably a wee homage to Derry as well. “Its a lovely place up here. You could set a Christmas book anywhere but a festive story works perfectly well here. “Theres so many places in Derry that you could use for the book.” Robert Campbells book, “Sled Down!” is available to buy at Little Acorns Bookstore on Foyle Street, Derry or from Amazon at: https:www.amazon Sled-Down-friends-rescue-Christmas dp BKNZQN  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

After continuing with his le, as best he could, he collapsed last year in his garden with back and leg pain.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Reynolds had a previous spell at the club back in - under Stephen Kenny and he admitted he felt he had unfinished business at the Brandywell. “I’m not sureI ever thought I would arrive back here but it is a club I have a good affinity with,” he said. “I really enjoyed my spell here in  and . At times I felt like it was unfinished business that I would end up here at some stage because of the relationship I had with some of the people up here. I’m delighted to be here, it’s a new challenge and there’s a lot expected from us, but we’ll embrace that and enjoy it.” City boss Ruaidhri Higgins took his time deciding on his number two and feels he has now got the right man for the job. “Alan is a fantastic coach and it is important for me to have someone of his quality and experience here,” he stated. “He knows the league inside out and will have the trust of the players, which is key. He’s been here before which always helps as well, and he will bring plenty of ideas and energy to the club. “We are comfortable with where we are in our preparations for the new season and are looking forward to getting going again in the coming weeks. ”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, rd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The  Local Elections saw Derry with its first nationalist majority in council as well as Hugh C.

The Greencastle native played at the Brandywell between - and became one of the most beloved players in the club’s history in that time. After bursting onto the scene with a hat trick against Limerick in the promotion  relegation semi-finals in , Mark really came into his own following the arrival of Stephen Kenny a year later. Forming a lethal partnership with Gary Beckett, Mark was the lead goalscorer in one of the club’s most successful periods in the League of Ireland era, with City becoming a household name across Ireland and Europe in  and . Forced to retire due to a brain tumour, Mark scored the winning goal to hand Derry City the First Division title in what was supposed to be his final game for the club on a memorable and emotional night in Monaghan in . However, showing incredible fighting spirit, Mark ed to break Liam Coyle’s long-standing goal record with a hat trick against Mervue United in the FAI Cup in  to stand alone as the club’s most lethal hitman since entering the League of Ireland. Mark then moved to Glenavon before he was forced to retire again in , and he spent the next few years battling his illness alongside his family and we Terri before tragically passing away in , aged , after a brave battle with cancer.  Incredible le ‘The Love of the Game’ tells Mark’s story through the eyes of those who knew him best, and those who shared those precious moments with him on his journey through an incredible le. From his wicked sense of humour, to his hopes, fears and his amazing refusal to give up in the most dficult of circumstances, the story of Mark’s le is inspiring, hilarious and heart-breaking in equal measure. “Mark signied everything that was good about the human spirit,” Republic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny says. “He was such a good person. I just loved his warmth, his humility and his smile and laughter around the group. “It was an amazing period and Mark Farren was our goal scorer. He was the player who scored the most goals. He was our first defender, our first line of attack who chased down every lost cause. He was prolic, he was quick, he was dynamic, he was skillful, he was inventive and he could score all types of goals. He could chip the goalkeeper, he could go around the keeper easily with his speed and control and he had a venomous left foot and accurate so he could score any type of goal.”  ‘Big goals’ Derry City manager Ruaidhri Higgins remembers Mark as the man for the big occasion. “He scored in cup finals, he scored on final days of the season Mark always scored in big games and big moments and always scored against the top teams as well,” he said. “You get lads who score lots of goals but they punish the lesser teams, whereas Mark scored a lot of big goals in big games and when you do that you are a hell of a player.” “When I signed for Bohemians, the likes of Jason McGuinness and Brian Shelley and Owen Heary always commented on how much they hated playing against Mark Farren. These are top players sometimes you can take your own team mates and players for granted, but that coming from opposition players who have won the lot, and for other players who constantly talk about Mark Farren highlights how good he was.” Former teammate Paddy McCourt rates Mark as one of the finest finishers he ever played alongside. “When I think of Mark Farren, the first thing that comes to mind is goals,” he added. “He was a ruthless finisher. He was a quiet, unassuming fella off the pitch, with a very dry but witty sense of humour. I always found him good company. He was quite happy to be in the background and be funny. “We had a lot of big characters in the dressing room at the time, so Mark would have been a quieter type of funny. He would have been happy to be playing pranks on people and joking about. I always found him really funny.

The Greencastle native played at the Brandywell between - and became one of the most beloved players in the club’s history in that time. After bursting onto the scene with a hat trick against Limerick in the promotion  relegation semi-finals in , Mark really came into his own following the arrival of Stephen Kenny a year later. Forming a lethal partnership with Gary Beckett, Mark was the lead goalscorer in one of the club’s most successful periods in the League of Ireland era, with City becoming a household name across Ireland and Europe in  and . Forced to retire due to a brain tumour, Mark scored the winning goal to hand Derry City the First Division title in what was supposed to be his final game for the club on a memorable and emotional night in Monaghan in . However, showing incredible fighting spirit, Mark ed to break Liam Coyle’s long-standing goal record with a hat trick against Mervue United in the FAI Cup in  to stand alone as the club’s most lethal hitman since entering the League of Ireland. Mark then moved to Glenavon before he was forced to retire again in , and he spent the next few years battling his illness alongside his family and we Terri before tragically passing away in , aged , after a brave battle with cancer.  Incredible le ‘The Love of the Game’ tells Mark’s story through the eyes of those who knew him best, and those who shared those precious moments with him on his journey through an incredible le. From his wicked sense of humour, to his hopes, fears and his amazing refusal to give up in the most dficult of circumstances, the story of Mark’s le is inspiring, hilarious and heart-breaking in equal measure. “Mark signied everything that was good about the human spirit,” Republic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny says. “He was such a good person. I just loved his warmth, his humility and his smile and laughter around the group. “It was an amazing period and Mark Farren was our goal scorer. He was the player who scored the most goals. He was our first defender, our first line of attack who chased down every lost cause. He was prolic, he was quick, he was dynamic, he was skillful, he was inventive and he could score all types of goals. He could chip the goalkeeper, he could go around the keeper easily with his speed and control and he had a venomous left foot and accurate so he could score any type of goal.”  ‘Big goals’ Derry City manager Ruaidhri Higgins remembers Mark as the man for the big occasion. “He scored in cup finals, he scored on final days of the season Mark always scored in big games and big moments and always scored against the top teams as well,” he said. “You get lads who score lots of goals but they punish the lesser teams, whereas Mark scored a lot of big goals in big games and when you do that you are a hell of a player.” “When I signed for Bohemians, the likes of Jason McGuinness and Brian Shelley and Owen Heary always commented on how much they hated playing against Mark Farren. These are top players sometimes you can take your own team mates and players for granted, but that coming from opposition players who have won the lot, and for other players who constantly talk about Mark Farren highlights how good he was.” Former teammate Paddy McCourt rates Mark as one of the finest finishers he ever played alongside. “When I think of Mark Farren, the first thing that comes to mind is goals,” he added. “He was a ruthless finisher. He was a quiet, unassuming fella off the pitch, with a very dry but witty sense of humour. I always found him good company. He was quite happy to be in the background and be funny. “We had a lot of big characters in the dressing room at the time, so Mark would have been a quieter type of funny. He would have been happy to be playing pranks on people and joking about. I always found him really funny. He was just a great lad who loved being a footballer for Derry City. “I have been fortunate to play international football, I have been fortunate to play with some big clubs, but it was very rare in that time that I played with someone, who,they went through one on one, I was as confident as I was when I seen Mark Farren go through one on one. The goals that he got for Derry City speak volumes about that being true.” ‘The Love of the Game’ will be released in the coming days, with details of the launch set to come.

With  minutes played, the Maghera side trailed their Antrim counterparts by - to - and looked to be fading into the December chill. However, Thomas McKeagneys nd effort got St Pats moving again, and they had closed the gap to five points at the second half water break. When James Friels th minute free dropped straight to the net, it left just the minimum between the sides and Maghera outscored Garron Tower by - to - in the final ten minutes to take the spoils. The defeated St Killians side. The Derry men had started brightly too, and a Callum OKane brace had them - to - up after just five minutes, but a magnicent double save from Odhran McElhinney proved a warning for St Pats. Two huge frees from Joseph McLaughlin got St Killians off the mark, and after Niall McGarrell had put them ahead on  minutes, McLaughlins third gave them a - to - lead at the water break. Well in the ascendency, Garron Tower were swaggering, and hit three points in as many minutes from McLaughlin , Cormac McKeown and Niall McGarrell to extend the lead to five points. James Friel hit back with two long range frees, but a long range Padraig McKillop effort in stoppage time saw St Killians lead by - to - at the break. The Antrim side continued where they left off in the second half, another brace of McLaughlin frees and a McGarrell effort opening up a seven-point lead, but then things began to turn.  St Pats Knock out Our Ladys to reach Mageean semi final  The Maghera school will now meet St Killians, Garron Tower in the semi final.   Thomas McKeagney punched the air after hitting St Pats first second half score on  minutes, and Callum OKane wriggled free to point and leave them trailing - to - at the water break. Corner back Conor Shiels raised a roar from his team with a long-range free on  minutes to close the gap to three, before St Pats got the little bit of luck they were craving. James Friel sent in a long free, and despite several swinging hurls, the ball floated over them all and into the net. Another Shiels free levelled matters in the th minute, but the expected St Killians backlash never came, and McKeagney nudged Maghera in front on  minutes. A sublime sideline cut from Eoin Scullion doubled the lead three minutes later, before Conor Shiels third free opened a - to - gap. Only a goal would do for Garron Tower, but they watched in disappointment as Seanie McIntosh’s attempt at dropping the ball into the box floated over the bar, and Conor Shiels restored the three-point margin with a nd minute free, his fourth of the day. A satisfying comeback for the Maghera side, who will now contest a Mageean Cup final with either St Louis Ballymena or St Patricks Downpatrick, who meet at the Dub on Friday night.

Gemma Doherty and Morgana MacIntyre, Reporter: Domhnall MacDermott Dec   addthis, Fresh from winning Album of the Year at the NI Music Awards, the Derry Belfast duo Saint Sister are destined for big things. The group, made up of Derry born singer harpist Gemma Doherty, of the Delacroix Dohertys, and Belfast-born singer Morgana MacIntyre, are currently playing their first tour in almost two years. googletag.cmd.push I caught up with Gemma after their triumphant Nerve Centre debut last weekend: What’s it like playing for crowds again after a year of livestreams  “It was amazing to see creative people come together and make some really special online shows in the absence of live music. “That said, it’s hard to beat the feeling of people coming together and experiencing something live in a room. “I really missed the feedback you get from the audience and how that feeds into the performance. “It can completely dictate the energy of a show, and that’s just not something you can create with only cameras in the room. “I think we’ve been a lot less nervous chatting and engaging with the audience since everything has opened back up, and we’re a lot more aware of being in the moment since it was taken away from us for a while.” Which do you prefer  Stripped down shows or playing with the full band  “I absolutely love playing the shows with the full band, especially with the seven-piece or the -piece band that we got to play with for our album livestream back in June. It’s a dream to hear the full scale of the album arrangements behind us when we’re on stage. “But I’ve been really enjoying the run of more intimate two-piece shows that we’ve been playing over the last few weeks. “When you strip the songs right back to their core, it becomes all about the vocals and finding the journey of each song with just one instrument behind it. “ We seem to lock into a dferent kind of flow and it feels like we’re engaging with the audience on a dferent level.” What was it like opening for Keane in America before lockdown  “It was great craic. Those were some of the biggest venues we’d ever played and the crowds and venues were beautul. “The last show we played in the states was in the stunning Dolby Theatre in LA where the Oscars had been held just a few weeks before. “It was supposed to be a  date tour, but we got to play  shows on the West Coast before things started closing down and we had to come home.” What’s been the best part of touring again and why was it playing Derry  “Hearing people sing along to the tunes from the second album has been really special, and as I mentioned before, being able to feel the audience in the room again and react to their energy. Derry was a class gig, we loved it. “It’s always a bit nerve-racking playing in your hometown, the stakes feel higher. “But it was the warmest welcome we could have asked for, and the same in Morgan’s hometown Belfast the following night.” Did you make any changes to the new album after lockdown delayed it’s release  “Thankfully we had just got our final mixes back around the beginning of March , and by the time the first lockdown hit we were already getting it mastered. It would have been so tempting to go back in and tweak it endlessly with the perceived extra time that lockdown gave us. I’m grateful in a way that it was finished before all that, and that it got to stay true to itself before the world went a bit mad.” How did it feel to win the NI Music Award’s Album of the Year   “Thank you! There were so many great albums out this year so we were genuinely shocked when it was announced. We missed the ceremony in the Ulster Hall unfortunately as we had a show in Waterford that night but we came off stage and looked at our phones and got a lovely surprise! And we got to celebrate properly a few nights later with the hometown shows in Derry and Belfast.” Other Voices is  this year. Want to share some memories of it from over the years  “Some of our favourite experiences as a band have been with the Other Voices gang. “There Courage livestreams were so inspiring and really set the bar for what a streamed experience could be, taking hold of some of the country’s most beautul spaces and opening them up in a new way. “We did an Other Voices livestream in the Guildhall last July with the string quartet from the Crash Ensemble and I think it was one of my favourite shows of all time. “ We’ve had some of the best weekends in Dingle over the years too, playing in St James’ Church in  was a massive one. “We met Lisa Hannigan for the first time outside the church after that gig, which lead to us going on tour with her a few months later, and having her feature on our most recent album.” Saint Sister’s brilliant second album, ‘Where I Should End,’ is available in Cool Discs on Foyle Street and other good record shops.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The resulting spot kick was coolly dispatched again by Robinson.At the beginning of the second half Omagh pulled level again and the sidelines were a hive of activity, with changes being rung by both sides.Left-back Jack Kelly delivered a deep cross into the Omagh box and the hardworking Tom Crudington recycled it out to Calam Mulqueen, who made no mistake when called upon to put Down High - ahead with the clock running low.But once again Down High became complacent as Omagh turned the screw and won countless corners. The pressure took its toll and a thoroughly deserved equaliser left the tie at - with the visitors left wondering what had gone wrong.At this stage, goalkeeper Alex Truesdale was busy keeping his side in the game and made one miraculous point blank save, resembling Jerzy Dudekrsquos heroics for Liverpool in the  Champions League final.Extra-time loomed large and with the floodlights now on both sides knew that one mistake or a well-placed pass could be decisive.After a cautious start to extra-time, Caolan Lennon stepped up to take a free-kick and scored a simply stunning goal into the top corner of the Omagh goal mdasha tremendous -yard thunder strike that encapsulated his class throughout the game.Omagh Academy pushed to get back into the game and were caught on the counter when that man Robinson pounced and rounded the rsquokeeper to score and put somne breathing space between the sides.Robinsonrsquos goalscoring exploits won him the man-of-the-match award, with Mulqueenrsquos midfield battling also worthy of high commendation.Lennon was a constant thorn in Omaghrsquos side while mazy runs from Josh Ward caught the eye, with Josh McMullan working hard too.

In a newspaper report, a journalist said he was an unsung hero, he was exactly that.His sons, Barry and Stephen, have now received the award on behalf of Bonny which will be kept at the family home with their mother.Stephen said that his father would have been ldquoquietly delighted with his award.ldquoHe was a very modest man, not one for taking the limelight, he said of the grandfather-of-one who worked as a mechanic.ldquoMy father was also very involved in local skittles and he would raise money by holding skittle nights or other clubs would fundraise for him, added Stephen.ldquoMany players would bring their skittles to him for repair and he would never take money for it, just ask them to make a donation to Marie Curie.ldquoHe and my mum would have collected money from around the ground at Drumaness Mills any time there was a final so they were always very involved in it. My father dedicated a lot of his time to Marie Curie.Stephen added that due to his fatherrsquos love of local sport, GAA and darts clubs also supported his fundraising activities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Sam McBride trust charity night  ","story":"PROGRESS continues to be made to erect a le-size granite replica of world championship road racer Brian Reid at the Temple roundabout.The Sam McBride Temple Motorcycle Clubrsquos charitable trust ndash which is the driving force behind the new monument plan ndash recently held a successful charity night at Temple Golf Club which was very generously supported.Guests included former world champion and road racing legend Reid and his family who were joined by road racers Glen and Andrew Irwin and their families.

Together we can put a stop to illegal puppy farming. Buying a puppy from illegal breeders can have devastating results, she continued.ldquoOften puppies die a short time after purchase or end up with infectious diseases such as parvovirus which is expensive to treat and, often fatal. They can also suffer behavioural issues relating to fear and anxiety due to poor or no socialisation.Chief Inspector Ford said it can be tempting to buy a puppy in these circumstances and often purchasers will recognise that things are not quite right, asking people to remember that by lsquorescuingrsquo a puppy in these circumstances, they are fuelling and supporting what is a particularly lucrative criminal industry.She added: ldquoWe would encourage anyone who is aware of illegal dog breeding establishments to contact their local council and we would like to take this opportunity to thank those that have done so to date already.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason said the local authority was committed to working with its partners to address this issue.ldquoWe investigate all reports made to us, she said. ldquoRecently, animal welfare officers seized seven dogs from a property following reports the animals were kept in poor living conditions and a further  dogs were seized at an illegal puppy farm with associated poor environmental conditions.Cllr Mason said the local authority is currently investigating a case of failing to ensure the welfare needs of dogs and causing unnecessary suffering.She continued: ldquoThis is a particularly timely message at this time of year when many will be thinking of purchasing a puppy for Christmas.ldquoCouncils are the lead agency when it comes to animal welfare issues and we routinely work with other agencies such as police and Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to help us tackle this serious issue.Cllr Mason also asked people across the district for their help.She added: ldquoIf anyone sees or is are aware of anything untoward, please report it to your localcouncil dog warden immediately so we can take appropriate action and seek assistance from relevant partners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13260700.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Monaghan.DAERA officials have also confirmed, late last night, the presence of Avian Influenza in two wild birds retrieved from the Belfast Waterworks site earlier this week.Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread.Under the new housing measures, all bird keepers in NI will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures.This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard or hobby flock.Announcing the decision to introduce a housing order, Minister Poots said: ldquoI took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland.ldquoIt is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.ldquoThis decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry.ldquoThis decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zoneintroduced on November , and is another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed.ldquoThese housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ.ldquoSince my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast ndash that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population.ldquoKeeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out.ldquoAdhering to, and a constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion.ldquoMy officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the Republic as the situation develops.To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules, a Biosecurity self-assessment tool has been developed that is available on the DAERA website.If avian influenza were to enter NI, the disease would have a signicant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from their vetthey have any concerns.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hence it is that effective opposition to the protocol is severely compromised because the DUP are not willing to sacrice their idol in defence of the Union.

The prime minister, the EU and pan nationalism know this and so treat Jeffrey Donaldson’s threats as no more than empty, hollow rhetoric. They are as void of meaning as Arlene Foster’s “blood red lines” and Nigel Dodds’ “precious Union”. The stark reality for unionism is that the DUP are as much an obstacle to the removal of the protocol as are the EU and pan nationalism.If as unionists we really want to remove the protocol I suggest we must first begin by voting the DUP out of office. We have the opportunity in May . Unless and until we do so the protocol will remain.Richard Ferguson, Dollingstown ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Well maybe, but not as low as % which is now the accepted benchmark for making cataclysmic constitutional change. Still, % must be worrying for advocates of Irish unity.One of the consequences of a  years of partition is that most southerners don’t really know people from the north. And we don’t know them very well either. If Taoiseach Micheal Martin arrived at the average house in Northern Ireland he probably wouldn’t be recognised. It’s far more likely that he would be mistaken for someone who wanted to tarmac your driveway.Give anti-vaxxers the wrong treatment. For a broken leg prescribe listening to Van Morrison’s latest albumSo this poll is a real opportunity for unionism.Let’s face it Ulster Protestants have an, often unfair, reputation for being ... how can I put this politely ...dour, sour-baked, stubborn, thran, carnaptious and frankly unpleasant. This is a real asset to be exploited.So here’s my advice to unionists. Forget about trying to make Northern Ireland work, , instead concentrate on making yourselves so thoroughly obnoxious and unattractive as to ensure a landslide No vote down south. Unionists should immediately launch a campaign to put southerners off a United Ireland. We could call it “Operation You Couldn’t Like Us”This, of course, is where Jim Allister would really come in to his own. Exposing Jim to a southern audience and letting him just be himself is bound to enrage and alienate anyone who sees him. He should set up a southern branch of the TUV and run for the Dail and get on RTE as much as possible. But don’t stop there. Unionists should go on special missions down south with instructions to annoy as many people as possible. Firstly, every time you meet a southerner make sure to always call the south “Eire”. It really winds them up. Deliberately mispronounce Taoiseach and Tanaiste – to be fair unionists are already great at doing this — and always remember to roll your eyes and sigh when anyone speaks Irish.Keep reminding southerners that a British team won the All-Ireland this year. Also keep asking southerners what the All-Ireland is. Drop in to Aras an Uachtarain*and demand to know where the Deputy First President’s Office is.Send Stephen Nolan on a  county live tour and let people stare in amazement as he claims to be the “biggest show in the country”. “Country  The  Counties is a country  ”Or best of all just drive a big bus all around the south with a slogan written on the side of it: “Britain gives Northern Ireland £ billion a year. How much are you willing to pay ”That’s the Union safe for another  years. You can thank me later.• I would give anti-vaxxers medical treatment – the wrong treatmentHow has your week been Probably better than that of a North Macedonian women’s football fan. Or a Barbadian royalist. Or a council chief executive watching ‘Spotlight’. Mine was OK until I tried to watch ‘I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here’. I didn’t recognise any of the celebrities. My son said they were all Z list nobodies and were so obscure he was surprised I didn’t get the call.I didn’t let this annoy me because I’m an easy-going person, a stranger to anger. But I’m afraid to say that this week the mask-dodgers, Covid-sceptics and vaccine scaredy cats really are starting to challenge my natural equanimity.Three DUP MPs voted against mask-wearing. What have the DUP got against masks  Fair enough the Shinners have traditionally been very pro-mask. Especially in the s, s and s but that was pre-pandemic.Worst of all there was an anti-vax protest in Belfast last week during which a woman read out an anonymous letter from a ‘real’ nurse. Among the numerous ludicrous allegations in this farrago of fabrication and fakery was the claim that medical staff were being asked to lie in hospital beds and pretend to be sick with Covid. This was simultaneously hilarious and grossly offensive to hard-working NHS staff. But what can NHS staff do when faced with bare-faced liars  How do you deal with hysterical people who compare having to show a QR code on your phone to the Nazi death camps The Hippocratic Oath requires medical people to treat the ill, no matter how stupid those people are. I’m not saying that anti-vaxxers should be denied medical treatment. Of course not. I would give them medical treatment. But I would give them the wrong medical treatment. If an anti-vaxxer turns up at AE with a broken leg simply prescribe listening to Van Morrison’s latest album. It’ll take their mind off the pain. Or even better let these self-appointed medical experts treat each other. Anti-vaxxers should play Russian Roulette with their own health the same way they do with ours. Let Piers Corbyn do Paul Frew’s ingrown toenail. Let Paddy Barnes have a go at an appendectomy. After all they’ve all done their “own research”. How hard can it be  The Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture and Traditionreport has been published, after a long delay.Setting up such a commission was the right thing to do. If Northern Ireland is to be a harmonious, stable society in which people across the community can feel respected in their identity and cultural affiliations, then the very least we can do is try to navigate a way through these thorny topics.The report is  pages long so will take some time to absorb. That it has been able to make  recommendations given the breadth of its commissioner baseis progress of sorts.But on core topics such as flying flags from lamposts and public buildings, on terrorist memorials, and on the handling of bonfires there is no agreement.That Declan Kearney, the chairman of Sinn Fein, is calling for an “orderly implementation” of the proposals hardly gives cause for optimism about the likely fate of the report.While the approach of republicans towards, for example, the Northern Ireland centenary has been depressingly intransigent, in a way it has helped to clary things. There is no generosity and there seems to be little prospect of generosity.Disgracefully, Northern Ireland has not been allowed to celebrate its th birthday — we have not even been allowed to be marked at Stormont with a centenary stone. Not even a church service of celebration of our wonderful country .What chance is there of wider agreement And what prospect is there of consensus on bonfires given that Sinn Fein and the SDLP over the summer took to the courts to try to force a resolution to a contested bonfire in north Belfast  Or when there are efforts to float the idea of two national flags flying on public buildings in NI, which would be a symbolic undermining of UK sovereignty and the consent principle ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityConservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden said his party had no intention of cancelling its own Christmas drinks, and others should continue with their celebrations.His remarks came as figures showed Covid- infections have increased in all four UK nations and remain close to record levels, though the latest rise is not linked to the arrival of the Omicron iant.Around one in  people in private households in England had Covid- in the week to November , up from one in  the previous week, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics .The proportion of people in England who were estimated to have coronavirus at the peak of the second wave in early January was one in

previous week and slightly below the recent record high of one in .In Northern Ireland, the latest estimate is also one in , up from one in  the previous week and slightly below the record of one in

Downing Street in the run-up to Christmas would be ldquoprivate events that would not be publicly announced.Askedhe would inform reportersthere were plans for a Christmas party for staff, the Prime Ministerrsquos spokesman said: ldquoObviously, events that happen in No  that are private events, we wouldnrsquot inform you.ldquoWe obviously wouldnrsquot set out details of private s in No  but, as I say, there will be festive events in the run-up to Christmas..removeIt comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who received his booster dose of the Covid vaccine on Thursday, urged the public to ldquocontinue as they are within the new measures introduced to stop the spread of the virus, following the emergence of the Omicron iant.Senior Tories, including Health Secretary Sajid Javid, have looked to encourage the public to hold firm to their pre-Christmas plans, with the hospitality industry warning it had suffered a ldquoslew of cancellations after Omicron sparked fresh safety fears.Mr Dowden told Sky News: ldquoThe message to people, I think, is fairly straightforward ndash which is: keep calm, carry on with your Christmas plans.ldquoWersquove put the necessary restrictions in place, but beyond that keep calm and carry on.The former culture secretary said he understood there were ldquoconcerns about the Omicron iant of coronavirus, but argued the Government had put in place ldquosufficient measures, such as reinstating rules around wearing face coverings in shops and on public transport, in response.ldquoPeople should continue with their plans as intended, Mr Dowden said, as he encouraged people to take up the offer of a booster jab.Asked about the Toriesrsquo own party plans, he told BBC Breakfast: ldquoI think it is still planned, and I donrsquot intend to cancel it as chairman of the Conservative Party.Medical experts have struck a more cautious tone, however, urging people to avoid large groups this winter.Influential scientist Professor Peter Openshaw said he would not feel comfortable attending a party as the ldquochances of getting infected were too high.Prof Openshaw, a member of the Governmentrsquos New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group , told BBCrsquos Question Time: ldquoPersonally, I wouldnrsquot feel safe going to a party at the moment,it involves being indoors in an enclosed space where yoursquore close to other people, and people are not wearing masks.ldquoEventheyrsquove been tested and vaccinated, I wouldnrsquot feel safe.The British Medical Associationsaid people should be encouraged to ldquoavoid large groups and meet outdoors where possible over the festive period.The debate over social gatherings comes as scientists continue to study the possible threat posed by Omicron.A study in South Africa, where the mutation was first detected, has suggested that the iant has ldquosubstantial ability to cause reinfection in people who have previously had Covid.The research, which has not been peer-reviewed, found people who had tested positive for coronavirus could pick up the virus again, potentially causing a wave of infections in those with some prior immunity.It did not say how the iant will behave when spreading in a highly vaccinated population such as the UK, or whether the virus can evade the protection offered by vaccines against severe disease.But experts in the UK believe their research on the impact of booster vaccines could offer hope in the fight against Omicron. vw,vw,px, px\"The CovBoost study found that booster jabs may well offer good protection in the face of the iant.A team studying the effects of third doses said the bodyrsquos T cell immune response after a booster shot is such that it may provide protection from hospital admission and death.The study also backs up the UKrsquos decision to offer Pfizer or Moderna as a third shot, with mRNA jabs leading to the most signicant rise in immunity levels.Professor Saul Faust, trial lead and director of the NIHR Clinical Research Facility at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, said the vaccines worked well against existing iants, although Omicron was not tested in the study.Asked specically about Omicron, he said: ldquoOur hope as scientists is that protection against hospitalisation and death will remain intact..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga,

Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon will benefit from greenway works in Dromore and secure cycle parking, bike repair stands and cycle counters.Mrs Kelly said: “The announcement of an additional £m funding from SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon will benefit projects and people locally and across the North. Since becoming a minister, Nichola Mallon has made greenway and active travel projects a key priority for her and it’s great to see this delivery building on the success of other projects in this area. “In Upper Bann, cycle parking facilities and its usage have been generally very low but a large proportion are located on private land for customer use.
