The key, as I’ve said, was operational needs. But today, it seems, the Military has changed radically. The announcement by the Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, that there are no roles in the military that women cannot do surely suggests that SAS selection will be opened up to them. This could mean one of two things: Women being allowed to attempt selection as it stands, which they will physically fail or that selection will be somehow modified to accommodate them. If the latter is true, it would be utterly misguided because not only would it lower standards, it also is totally unnecessary.As I’ve explained, women have been able to join the SAS in the past without going through traditional selection – and this has been driven by operational need.My fear, however, is that the Defence Secretary’s announcement is not driven by such a need, but by politics.The fact is that the men of the SAS are selected to be an elite. The physical expectation of them is fearsome.We can either abandon our ability to complete such operations in order to fall into line with political correctness or accept that there are some things females cannot do biologically. My fervent hope is that Gavin Williamson is doing this for all the right reasons and not because he has caved into the bankrupt military equality lobby which he so long resisted. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/23/07/518E422F00000578-0-image-a-7_1540277251934.jpg","title":"Controlling boyfriend sniffed girlfriends knickers handcuffed her","story":"John McLaughlin handcuffed himself to Devon Brown at night to make sure she wasn\u0027t being unfaithful (both are pictured) Terrified mother was found dead close to the body of her...Irish woman, 27, admits stabbing her controlling fiancé, 29,...Share this articleDevon, 26, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, bought her boyfriend handcuffs for Valentine\u0027s Day to \u0027spice up\u0027 their relationship.But he used them to bind himself to her in what she described as \u0027mental torture\u0027 that led to her having a \u0027breakdown\u0027. McLaughlin’s behaviour was uncovered when police attended the home to deal with a domestic violence incident.

And because it\u0027s on a Monday, Philip Hammond will not speak until 3.30pm because parliamentary business gets off to a later start after the weekend.So will there be anything leftfield in the speech itself? Well even in the dullest Budgets there is usually something worth commenting on. Here we run down what might be in the 2018 fiscal statement:ECONOMY AND PUBLIC BORROWINGBritain\u0027s finances are in better shape than they have been since the 2008 crash. Official figures show Government borrowing below £40billion in 201718, having peaked at £153billion in 2009.And it emerged this week that the pressure could have eased on the Chancellor to raise taxes to fund Tory pledges on the NHS and ending austerity.Help, my £1m property is a Stamp Duty prison! On the eve of...Stamp duty and property slowdown blamed as number of homes...Have cash Isas become too complex? The amount of money...Share this articleWhat to expect in the Budget - and is a Labour government the real big tax threat? The This is Money podcastReports said that stronger than expected tax receipts mean that the Office for Budget Responsibility\u0027s forecasts for the public finances were set to reduce the deficit for 2018-19 by around £13billion - a massive revision.That could help the Chancellor avoid unpopular tax increases to pay for Theresa May\u0027s pledge earlier this year to raise an additional £20billion a year for the NHS in England by 2023.One of the many things that Brexit makes awkward is economic forecasting: the Office for Budget Responsibility has its work cut out there. For the record, the OBR\u0027s current forecasts are below.          Workers will be getting out their calculators if the Chancellor freezes income tax thresholds on Monday.Some £7billion worth of previously announced benefit cuts are still working their way through the system.There is a lot of pressure from Tory backbenchers for more generous funding of Universal Credit, including from the architect of the system Iain Duncan Smith.  Reversing cuts to the new benefit imposed by George Osborne in 2015 could cost anything between £2-£5billion.Any serious change to the rollout, or the generosity of the benefit, would be politically embarrassing after Mr Hammond\u0027s resolute defence of the scheme. VAT, SIN TAXES AND INSURANCE PREMIUM TAXIt is tempting for Chancellors to increase the tax on insurance because no one really takes much notice. And they have done: the Government has been raising the rate on Insurance Premium Tax in recent years. In 2011 it was just six per cent, but in 2015 was pushed up to 9.5 per cent, 10 per cent in 2016 and 12 per cent in June this year. Last year it raised £6.1billion from IPT - more than inheritance tax.          Duties on tobacco and alcohol are likely to rise although MPs have called for a freeze on beer duty to protect pubs.Reports say the Chancellor is examining controversial proposals to drag hundreds of thousands of firms into the VAT system. At present, traders only have to charge VAT if their turnover tops £85,000 a year.Halving the threshold to £43,000 – the level said to be favoured by the Chancellor – would affect half a million small firms and raise up to £1.5billion for the Treasury in extra VAT receipts.Cutting the rate to £25,000 could yield up to £2billion, but would drag 1.5million small traders into the VAT system. Similar plans were abandoned in the run-up to last year\u0027s Budget following warnings they would be politically toxic.One report has speculated that Mr Hammond could impose VAT on private school fees for the first time in a £1.5billion grab. Private schools do not currently charge the 20 per cent levy on the thousands of pounds a year they net in fees because they are set up as charities.Duties on tobacco and alcohol are likely to rise although MPs have called for a freeze on beer duty to protect pubs. FUEL DUTYDespite speculation this summer that Mr Hammond as set to lift the cap on vehicle excise duty, Theresa May has promised that VED will be frozen for the ninth year in a row. The Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank estimates that the policy costs the Treasury around £9billion a year.          Estate agents say homeowners aren\u0027t trading up for larger properties because of punitive stamp duty rates on more expensive homes.STAMP DUTY \u0026amp HOUSINGMr Hammond scrapped stamp duty for first-time buyers last year to help people get on the property ladder.But estate agents say homeowners aren\u0027t trading up for larger properties because of punitive stamp duty rates on more expensive homes - which is restricting the supply of smaller homes for first-timers and generally gumming up the property market.So there\u0027s a  chance he could do something again with the stamp duty rates higher up the ladder - it would be eye-catching and probably not that expensive.Other possibilities include \u0027help to sell\u0027: giving landlords tax incentives to sell to their tenants.PENSIONSAccording to the Treasury, tax relief costs the Government £39billion a year - a cost that some now believe is excessive. Hammond has described pensions tax breaks as \u0027eye-wateringly expensive\u0027.Mr Hammond could either cut rates of relief - which correspond to the higher rate at which the saver pays income tax - or the annual allowance, i.e., the amount one can save each year tax free. Or come combination of both.          The Chancellor is said to be considering a special fund to support ailing shopping areas in a bid to help a High Street under seige from taxes and the internet.SAVINGSThe Chancellor is facing calls to simplify the Isa landscape, with the plethora of products available causing confusion among savers.Savers today must trawl through seven types of Isa to work out which is best for them, including the basic cash Isa that has been rendered ineffective by the savings interest allowance and by poor rates.As the rock-bottom interest rate environment rumbles on, any move to re-introduce some form of penioner bond would prove highly popular.THE HIGH STREETThere is speculation struggling high streets could be thrown a £300million business rates lifeline. The Chancellor is said to be considering a special fund to support ailing shopping areas in a bid to help a High Street under seige from taxes and the internet.It is thought that he could unveil a £300million tax cut designed to help town centres badly hit by closures and the loss of more than 50,000 retail jobs so far this year. Firms in hard-hit areas could be offered an immediate cut to their rates that would last for two years.Other schemes being considered include a tax on huge foreign tech firms such as Amazon that are luring customers away from bricks and mortar stores.\u0026#xA318 for 11Mbps speeds\u0026#xA3200 cash to switch and stayFee-free overdraft for 6 months"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/13/20/4F12DE2F00000578-0-image-m-42_1534188410678.jpg","title":"WWE makes difficult decision recommit Saudi Arabian show","story":"    Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi disappeared after entering his country\u0027s consulate in Istanbul on October 2.

Bseiso has also been linked to the Munich atrocity and was assassinated in Paris in 1992.Labour insisted Mr Corbyn had been at the cemetery to commemorate 47 Palestinians killed in an Israeli air strike on a Tunisian PLO base in 1985.But the Mail found that the monument to the air strike victims is 15 yards from where Mr Corbyn is pictured – and in a different part of the complex. Instead he was in front of a plaque beside the graves of Black September members.For two days, Labour continued to insist that Mr Corbyn had attended a service to commemorate the 1985 victims.Corbyn\u0027s allies \u0027draw up emergency plans to protect Labour...Diane Abbott gets up and walks away when Jewish teenager...Hate-filled curtain raiser for Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s wreath...Share this articleBut Mr Corbyn then went on TV where he appeared to admit being present at a wreath-laying for Palestinian terrorists.

According to a story in The Guardian, it told Ipso that several papers had misrepresented the event which the Labour leader attended.Last night a spokesman for the Labour Party said: \u0027Our view remains that the reporting we complained about seriously misrepresented the nature of what took place, those buried in the cemetery and the mainstream Palestinian leaders conducting the ceremony, and these inaccuracies breached the Ipso code.\u0027Regrettably, confidential communication with Ipso was leaked and it was unable to trace the source or assure us it would not recur, and we considered that the complaints process was unacceptably compromised.

They had passed the extremely rigorous Surveillance Detachment selection designed to weed out anyone who would not be able to cope with the unique challenges of undercover operations.Both these women had served several tours of duty in Northern Ireland – behind the lines as it were – in the toughest parts of the province.Operating alone or in pairs, they knew that to be captured by the Republican movement ensured a hideous death. The senior of the two was a Warrant officer who had won a Queen’s Gallantry Medal before she was 21 and who also happened to be married to my Operations Warrant Officer – himself an experienced ‘Det’ operator as well as an SAS trooper of some standing.The reason for their recruitment into the SAS was simple – operational needs.

Private Laura Docherty of the Royal Army Medical Corp pictured on patrol in Helmand province, AfghanistanWomen can now serve in ALL roles in the Armed Forces...NATO kicks off its largest military exercises since the Cold...Share this articleHaving female operators badged in the SAS gave us the flexibility to get close to targets who would have otherwise seen us coming a mile away.I remember one operation to track an extremely violent Republican killer operating overseas, in which two operatives posing as a husband and wife with a pushchair – and with sub-machine guns within easy reach – were able to sit beside him on a park bench. The key, as I’ve said, was operational needs. But today, it seems, the Military has changed radically. The announcement by the Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, that there are no roles in the military that women cannot do surely suggests that SAS selection will be opened up to them. This could mean one of two things: Women being allowed to attempt selection as it stands, which they will physically fail or that selection will be somehow modified to accommodate them. If the latter is true, it would be utterly misguided because not only would it lower standards, it also is totally unnecessary.As I’ve explained, women have been able to join the SAS in the past without going through traditional selection – and this has been driven by operational need.My fear, however, is that the Defence Secretary’s announcement is not driven by such a need, but by politics.The fact is that the men of the SAS are selected to be an elite. The physical expectation of them is fearsome.We can either abandon our ability to complete such operations in order to fall into line with political correctness or accept that there are some things females cannot do biologically. My fervent hope is that Gavin Williamson is doing this for all the right reasons and not because he has caved into the bankrupt military equality lobby which he so long resisted. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/25/08/14B4C3A900000514-6313511-image-a-5_1540453289544.jpg","title":"Mass Debenhams store closures pile pressure Chancellor","story":"    The shop could also cut as many as 4,000 jobs over the next five years as it aims to remedy the financial loss          Philip Hammond is set to deliver his Budget on Monday with pressure mounting on th Chancellor to provide relief to the struggling high streetDetails of the crisis at Debenhams came just hours before online retailer Amazon unveiled bumper results.The contrasting fortunes between the firms triggered fresh calls for Mr Hammond to take action in the Budget on Monday to save the high street.Debenhams forked out £80million in business rates last year and more than £5million on its flagship store on Oxford Street alone – up 20 per cent on a year earlier. The figures are in stark contrast to rates paid by Amazon which came in at just £14million on its 14 warehouses across England and Wales last year.           Debenhams posted a loss of almost £500million for the year and is planning to close up to 50 stores as a result          Debenham\u0027s financial results for the year are a far cry from the previous results when the firm posted a profit of £59millionThe Mail has been campaigning for an overhaul of business rates, with more than 50,000 jobs lost this year as shoppers increasingly buy online.

Sergio Bucher, Chief Executive of Debenham, has backed calls for lower business rates‘So when you are facing a tough market, having business rates that continuously go up is a clear headwind and we definitely need our Government to take action to establish a level playing field across the retail industry.’Mr Bucher added that action on business rates was crucial in securing the future of the struggling high street.I can’t pre-empt what the Chancellor is going to announce on Monday.

She tells us about her meditative approach and why ‘thinking too much is boring’A translucent bubble floats in the air next to a picture of a baby’s head cradled tenderly in an adult’s arms. Nearby, among an arrangement of similarly intimate images, an infant’s tiny hand is gently enfolded in an elderly grandparent’s grasp. On a single wall in the National Portrait Gallery, amid the contrasting styles and subject matter of the 2018 Taylor Wessing portrait prize, Rinko Kawauchi’s vivid images of four generations of her family create a quietly intense space in which to pause and ponder the beauty and fragility of the everyday.Recently, that sense of life’s frailty has become more acute for Kawauchi following the birth of her daughter, whose first few years have been captured in characteristically hypnotic images. Since Kawauchi’s arrival on the art scene in 2001 with the simultaneous publication of three photobooks, Utatane (“Catnap”), Hanabi (“Fireworks”) and Hanako (a Japanese girl’s name), her family have featured in her work alongside often breathtakingly beautiful photographs of the natural world – insects, rainbows, clouds, butterflies and, of late, sacred rituals and ancient sites in her native Japan. She is an artist of the quotidian sublime, creating a world in which the tiniest details – a slice of watermelon on a plate, a bird’s egg cracking open – are imbued with meaning as part of the greater whole, the great interconnectedness.The images on show at the NPG are a continuation of an ongoing project that began with her 2005 book, Cui Cui, which comprised photographs of extended family taken over the previous 15 years. In that time, she witnessed the death of her grandfather and the birth of her nephew. It is not, though, she insists, a work of “personal disclosure” – rather a visual contemplation of the cycle of life in all its sadness and wonder.She is, she tells me in her faltering but often poetic English, “in sympathy with small things in the bigness of nature”. Her approach is patient, deeply attentive, akin to a kind of heightened meditation. “It’s about finding a certain space of mind, if that makes sense. When I am shooting, I am following my intuition without thinking. Thinking too much is boring, not good. It stops the surprising from coming through. When a picture happens, I just say ‘thank you’ and move on. It is only afterwards that I become an editor and impose the meaning on the work.”In person, the diminutive Kawauchi is quietly spoken and self-contained one senses that her work is an extension of her self. It is difficult to imagine her operating in the combative world of commercial advertising photography, which she did for several years after graduating from college in the early 1990s. She cites the American master of the everyday William Eggleston as a formative influence, alongside the younger Japanese photographer Takashi Homma. Her early images, which often seemed like deftly composed snapshots, were bathed in natural light and washed with bright colour tones that added to their almost dreamlike quality.In 2004, Martin Parr gave her two gallery spaces when he guest-curated Les Rencontres d’Arles, and in 2006 she had a solo show at the Photographer’s Gallery in London. Back then, I noted that her work “might initially appear to approach the deadpan detachment that characterises so much contemporary art-photography, but on closer inspection there is always some glimmer of hope and humanity, some sense of wonder at work in the rendering of the intimate and fragile.” That remains the case, but, of late, her vision has widened and deepened. In 2013, her series Ametsuchi announced a departure of sorts. Using a large format camera mounted on a tripod, she shot from a distance, creating panoramas of the stark, elemental, volcanic terrain around Japan’s Mount Aso, a sacred site for Shinto pilgrims who gather there to perform often spectacular fire rituals.Last year, Halo continued her exploration of these bigger themes. In rural Japan and China, she photographed other religious fire rituals and the vast constellations above. On England’s south-east coast, she captured the wondrous natural spectacle that is the murmuration of starlings. The private and the everyday had suddenly given way to the celestial elemental, the tranquil to the spectacular. And yet, they remained Rinko Kawauchi photographs: striking, luminous, poetic.“Halo is really about the relationship between nature and the manmade,” she says, “There is something about time passing in all the work and, with Halo, it is about a practice that is unchanging for hundreds of years while the world changes around it.”Her work is changing in other ways, too. When she began making work, Kawauchi gravitated towards the photobook as the perfect medium for her closely observed images of the world around her. Now, she is intrigued with the possibilities of the moving image. To this end, in 2015 she created an installation in a gallery in Shinjuku of video works mounted on 30 monitors, her images, both intimate and elemental, unfolding to an ambient soundtrack of natural noises – wind, insects – and “music created on real instruments”.I ask her, in conclusion, if being a mother has changed her approach to her work. She thinks for a long moment. “I would say yes, but not in the expected way. In my personal life, it has been amazing of course as a photographer, I am not so sure. When I feel happy, I see no reason to make work, but sometimes there is this hunger to make work. So, it is complicated. I need this hungry spirit and the calm. I need the balance to find the story inside me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe52592842efe1611eae994268b706ade56bcf2/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d509e3464e299dfd7b2a87b6a93bb58","title":"life on the tiny island of migingo in pictures","story":"A rounded rocky outcrop covered in metal shacks, Migingo Island rises out of the waters of Lake Victoria like an iron-plated turtle.

The right soundtrack has the power to transform even a burger and chips into a fine-dining experience, at least according to research by Cornell University. Why? Because the music makes us eat more mindfully and even perceive our food more favourably.“Dinner parties are essentially about communication and the mingling of several different conversations, so you want background music that’s sophisticated enough to spark conversation, then melt away rather than competing with your chat,” says composer Oliver Davis, whose 2018 album Liberty recently topped the iTunes classical charts. So what music works best with different dishes? We spoke to a range of experts – from restaurateurs to party planners and composers to find out.Soundtrack for starters“I put as much thought and care into the music I play at a dinner party as I do into my cooking,” says restaurateur Asma Khan of the Darjeeling Express in Soho, London.Her favourite starter is a mutton shikampuri kebab, a recipe from the Royal Kitchens of Hyderabad. “It has a uniquely layered shah-jeera flavour,” she says. “You think it’s mild at first, then the cardamom and cumin spice blend hits you. Most people don’t recognise all the flavours, but this starter never fails to impress.”While guests dig in, Khan plays the classical Indian Sufi song Maula-e-Kull, sung by Abdida Parveen. “It has a very deep rhythm,” she says. “You don’t need to understand the words to feel the emotion in the voice of the singer: it starts off with the love between two people, then becomes deeply complex. Both the song and the starter have this incredible hidden layering, and together they set a rich, serene tone for your evening.”Your musical main“The right music helps the conversation flow, which is particularly important when your guests are meeting for the first time,” says Alice Matthews, founder of MotherHustler supper clubs.“I love the classical guitar interpretation of Johann Sebastian Bach’s Air on a G String, by Richard Mollenbeck,” she says. Like the vegetarian tagine she serves her guests, the music is about different interpretations of a classic, melodiously coming together to create something new. “I’ve discovered guests relax and enjoy themselves more when eating familiar food and listening to familiar music, but in a heightened, luxurious atmosphere,” she says.Sweet symphony“I love to cook with seasonal, locally sourced ingredients, and my taste in music reflects that too,” says Henrietta Inman, author of The Natural Baker: A new way to bake using the best natural ingredients.“For a dinner party I’ll make my plum, blackberry and blueberry crumble, served with a rosemary and lemon syrup. The topping is crunchy and decadent, made with wholegrain spelt, oats and almonds.” And the perfect accompaniment? The Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams, says Inman.“It’s a beautifully tranquil piece by an English composer and it brings to mind a dusky evening eating outdoors, with birds singing in the hedgerows and trees hanging heavy with ripe fruit,” she says.The tune for cheese“The cheese course comes at a perfect moment to steer conversation into another direction,” says La Fromagerie’s Patricia Michelson, author of Cheese.She recommends presenting a five-strong board with Sinodun Hill, a nutty goat’s cheese the creamy, sweet and aromatic Beaufort Chalet D’Alpage Lincolnshire Poacher Double Barrel, a hard cheese with a distinctive savoury acidity from the chalky soil where the cattle graze a decadent Brie aux Truffes and Regalis, a ewe’s milk blue that combines sharp mineral qualities with a rich, floral taste.On the playlist is a classical composition with a jazz vibe, such as the Jacques Loussier Trio playing Bach. “It’s reflective and stimulating but soft and flowing, and these are words I often use when describing cheese too,” says Michelson.The finale Just as a digestif serves to calm the mood at the end of the meal, music plays a similar role. “One of the wonderful things about music is it fills in any awkward silence at the end of your dinner party, when everyone’s said an awful lot,” says Davis.“I love an Amaretto, but I wouldn’t be as didactic as to suggest that a sweet liqueur goes with sweet music,” he says. “Go for something cosy that welcomes guests into your own personal comfort zone.”For that, try downloading Rêverie Nocturne by Giulio Regondi or Liberty by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners know that food and music are the perfect pairing.

His consort song for five voices and five viols is effectively an early 17th-century rendering of the sounds of Cockney stallholders advertising everything from “lilywhite mussels and new fresh herrings” to “roasted sausage, hot puddings, fresh cheese and cream, and ripe strawberries”. It may well have been inspired by Clément Jannequin’s Voulez ouyr les cris de Paris – similarly including the everyday sounds of a Renaissance French street market.While today there are a few restaurants in which music students will entertain you with arias between courses, in centuries past musical accompaniment to dining was a common phenomenon. The concept only became formalised in the 18th century and the best-known collection of such work is Telemann’s Tafelmusik, (Table Music). Published in 1733, it is a traditional set of suites to be played by a small group of string players at banquets.A musical work inspired by food, which became a popular sensation following its 1898 London premiere, is Hiawatha’s Wedding Feast by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. The cantata for tenor, mixed chorus and orchestra sets part of Longfellow’s epic poem, delighting in the lush and sensual choral description of the sumptuous menu: “First they ate the sturgeon … and the pike … then on pemmican they feasted … and buffalo marrow, haunch of deer and hump of bison, yellow cakes of the Mondamin, and the wild rice of the river.”Belshazzar’s Feast (1931) depicts another impressive meal, this time a lavish banquet thrown by the hedonistic and hubristic Babylonian king. In the biblical cantata by William Walton, apart from generous libations of wine drunk from sacred goblets looted from the Temple of Jerusalem, Osbert Sitwell’s libretto does not tell us what was on the menu. However, a clue is given in a description of the city’s resources for such a meal: “fine flour, wheat, beasts and sheep”, which we might conclude, like the score, was lavish.On a smaller scale, Erich Korngold’s Die Gansleber im Hause Duschnitz, (The Goose-liver in the Duschnitz House) is a song written spontaneously by the Austrian composer following a meal in 1919, thanking his Viennese hosts by honouring their delicious main course, with his lyrics declaring: “Because a goose liver like this is a wondrous thing … when it’s browned, when it’s crisp and crackly …”In a rare instance of music from the perspective of the food itself, there is Olim lacus Colueram. Known as the Song of the Roasting Swan, the exquisite aria for tenor and chorus comes from the pseudo-medieval secular cantata Carmina Burana (1936) in which composer Carl Orff manages to create a sense of dizzying musical rotation as the roasting bird delivers its, er, swansong, with the tenor singing at the top of his range in sympathetic anguish.Turning to something more sugary, Hansel and Gretel, Engelbert Humperdinck’s 1893 operatic retelling of the Grimm fairy tale, features a gingerbread house covered in sweets. Tchaikovsky’s festive ballet The Nutcracker (1892) is also filled with confectionary, in which, following mice eating gingerbread soldiers, young Clara and her prince are whisked off to the Land of Sweets, which is ruled by the Sugar Plum Fairy, an otherworldly character represented by a brand-new twinkling keyboard instrument, the celesta.Then there are cookbooks set to music. La Bonne Cuisine (1947) was inspired by Emile Dumont’s culinary guide. From it the American composer Leonard Bernstein arranged four recipes for mezzo-soprano and piano. The gastronomic delicacies are Plum Pudding, Ox-Tails, Turkish Delight and Rabbit at Top Speed – the last well-named, as the entire song-cycle is under five minutes. Three years later with Ode à la Gastronomie (1950), composer Jean Françaix showed that the French can also have a sense of humour when it comes to food. His lighthearted satire punctures the pretentious solemnity of Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin’s 1825 tome La Physiologie du gout, offering a both comic and exquisite paean to the sensual pleasures of eating, setting the gastronomic ruminations as a choral work for 13 a capella singers.Eating, of course, provides a backdrop for dramatic action and consequently it often crops up in opera. A great example is Giacomo Puccini’s La Bohème, which migrates from a cold and empty flat in Montmartre to the local Cafe Momus. There, among the riot of life, street vendors shout their wares: “Oranges, dates, hot chestnuts, trinkets, crosses, nougat, whipped cream, fruit pies, toffees, finches, sparrows, dates, coconut milk, carrots, trout and plums.” The friends enter the bistro and order sausage, roast venison, table wine, dressed lobster, creme caramel and chicken, before leaving the bill for hapless sugar daddy Alcindoro.Finally, there is food inspired by classical musicians. French modernist Erik Satie ate only white foods, so for more mouthwatering invocations one must look to the Italians and dishes created in their honour. Neapolitan tenor Enrico Caruso had a sauce named after him by Uruguayan chef Raymundo Monti. Salsa Caruso is a warm sauce for pasta consisting of cream, onions, ham, cheese, nuts and mushrooms. Meanwhile, Tournedos Rossini is a steak dish created by French chef Marie-Antoine Carême in collaboration with the famously food-loving composer. It consists of beef tournedos pan-fried in butter, served on a crouton, topped with hot slice of foie gras, garnished with black truffle and Madeira demi-glace sauce.And for afters? How about peach melba, the famous dessert of peaches and raspberry sauce with vanilla ice-cream, created in 1892 by French chef Auguste Escoffier at London’s Savoy Hotel for the Australian soprano Dame Nellie. Quite a final movement, that is.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners know that food and music are the perfect pairing. Feeling inspired to cook your own masterpiece tonight?

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, EstelleMoon, who has had a disappointingly fulfilling experience:Well, as much as I’d like to say I’ve been reading something esoteric and obscure, no, I’ve been reading something incredibly popular. And as much as I’d like to say that the popular thing is overrated and bad, no, in fact, it turns out it’s incredibly popular and incredibly good.I’m talking about Elena Ferrante. I finished My Brilliant Friend a couple of days ago, and I’m now about 100 pages into Volume 2 of her Neapolitan Quartet, The Story of a New Name. They’re so vivid and rich when it comes to detailing this beautiful, frustrating and profound friendship between Elena and Lila, full of love, full of competition, full of resentment, full of life. But they’re also a portrait of a community, of a country coming from fascism, they’re about the urge to break away from the stifling world you grew up in, they’re about masculinity, about family, about politics and so much more – but all these heady themes emerge in the best way possible – ie, organically, through the story and the lives of Elena and Lila.Oh well. Elsewhere, julian6 has enjoyed Mario Vargas Llosa’s early book, The Time of the Hero:This account of the daily struggles and cruelties at a military academy in Peru has sharply etched characters and wonderfully economical descriptive work. Llosa plays with time sequences throughout, moving back and forth, slowly drawing out the painful life journeys of his characters. It is clear-eyed, unsentimental and unfailingly honest, showing its vulnerable, petty, vindictive but not entirely irredeemable protagonists in a raw uncompromising light. The translation brought out the fluency of phrasing, the choice vocabulary. These narrators - for there are many viewpoints in this work, as well as third person - know their world intimately. I was drawn in from the beginning. The sympathy that emerged was never pleaded for or crudely awakened. There is nothing cheap in Llosa’s vision - it is a naked portrayal of diminished lives caught in an unforgiving web of poverty, prejudice and pitiless power structures.A second reading of Life and Fate by Vasily Grossman has impressed Ieuan:Very similar to War and Peace (which was its inspiration – and of similar length and complexity). The manuscript was confiscated by the KGB upon writing and Grossman was told it couldn’t be published for ‘at least 200 years’. A copy was smuggled to the west in the 1980s and published here. It was hailed a masterpiece and (IMHO), it is.The Power by Naomi Alderman gets a nod from koelner:I just finished reading and it absolutely blew me away. I didn’t necessarily agree with how things developed (ie that it would really work out like that if it happened in real life) but it was just so clever, especially the letters between authors at the end. I finished it and immediately had the urge to write an essay on it like back when I was in school. I mean, I didn’t, but there was just so much to think about and comment on and discuss. It really fired my imagination. It would be such a good book to study at school. Really enjoyed it.Meanwhile, The Power and the Glory by Graham Greene has worked for scoopster35:Greene puts you exactly in his world – peasant Mexico, in this case – with no fuss, no flowery prose, just hard, clear, vivid writing.RedmonT recommends The End of Vandalism by Tom Drury:It’s hilarious. Rare indeed that I laugh out loud from a book but I have done several times already. There’s something tragic about it, too.Here’s paulburns on Richard Flanagan’s Death of a River Guide:During an expedition down the Franklin River in northwest Tasmania, Aljaz Cosini, the expedition’s guide, drowns in an attempt to rescue a punter who has fallen into the raging rapids. As he drowns he recalls not only his own life, but the lives of several generations of his relatives, one of whom is a Tasmanian Aborigine. (For those who don’t know, Tasmanian Aborigines are a different type of indigenous people to the mainland Indigenous Australians), and another a convict, whose relatives are ashamed of the ‘convict stain’. At the same time, Flanagan writes in detail and lovingly of travelling down the Franklin River (not the safest thing in the world to do) in a journey beset by tragedy. This is a fine, beautifully written book.I am reading Harry Potter again, this time with my grandson. He is the same age his mum was when the first book was published,when we found it in the library, well before it became A Thing. He pleads for another chapter each time we finish one. ‘You can read this yourself,’ I said. ‘Yes, but it’s funner having you read it so I can imagine it in my head’ he said.

Blackstone acquired the building for £320m in 2014, with reports suggesting it might sell for as much as £430m.“The short-term uncertainties surrounding Brexit have presented us with opportunities to acquire assets with deep value,” said Frank Khoo, the group chief investment officer at CDL.The 27-storey building, close to the Bank of England, is CDL’s second deal in London this year after a £183m transaction for Aldgate House in September.“We have confidence in the long-term fundamentals of London as a global financial hub with a robust office market,” Khoo said.The former Stock Exchange Tower is home to tenants including the law firm King \u0026amp Spalding, China International Capital Corporation and the property agents Cushman \u0026amp Wakefield, who advised CDL on the deal.Andrew Hawkins, an international partner at Cushman \u0026amp Wakefield, said CDL had snapped up the building without any rival bidders, securing it at an “attractive price”.Foreign investors have shown strong interest in the London commercial property market in the past 18 months.In August, Goldman Sachs agreed the £1.2bn sale and leaseback of its new London headquarters with Korea’s National Pension Service.In May, China completed a reported £200m-plus deal to buy the Royal Mint Court site, overlooking the River Thames and opposite the Tower of London, and plans to convert it to its new UK embassy.Last July, the controversial “Walkie Talkie” skyscraper sold for £1.3bn, a record price for a single building in the UK, to the property arm of Hong Kong’s Lee Kum Kee Health Products Group.In March 2017, the “Cheesegrater”, the tallest building in the City of London, was sold for £1.15bn to CC Land, a Hong Kong-listed company controlled by the Chinese property tycoon Cheung Chung-kiu."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0158e965d175f3e5bad33977a98bf84570f73e84/0_350_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96cd4bcb18b15ac51820bcbbef929985","title":"us tech disappointments dampen market recovery as investor jitters mount business live","story":"Investor fears mount as disappointing results from Amazon and Google add to a cocktail of risks, sending European and Asian markets sharply lowerIt’s partly a story of a stronger dollar, which is up against a basket of currencies ahead of the US GDP number at 1.30pm UK time.Another day, another statement from Patisserie Valerie, the troubled cafe and bakery chain which earlier this month discovered a black hole in its accounts and a £1m unpaid tax bill that threatened the firm’s collapse.The latest news is that Chris Marsh, the firm’s finance director who was arrested on suspicion of fraud and subsequently bailed, has resigned.Patisserie Holdings plc announces that following the suspension of Chris Marsh on 9 October 2018, the company has now accepted his resignation as the company’s finance director with immediate effect, while reserving its position in respect of any potential claims it may have against him.The latest announcement isn’t quite surprising as the company’s other ones over the past month.Thursdays rebound on Wall Street - with the Dow Jones surging 401 points - is nowhere to be seen today, with global markets on course for their worst week in more than five years. European markets are sharply lower and US futures suggest the Dow could lose another 300-or-so points when the bell goes on Wall Street.Here’s a look at US futures:The bailed-out bank published third-quarter results this morning, and the detail has underwhelmed investors.Operating costs also increased as the bank set aside another £200m for payment protection insurance claims.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says that hopes appear to have been dashed for a positive end to the week for the FTSE .Any suggestion UK stocks might end the week on a more positive note has been swatted aside after the third quarter sales performance of Amazon and Google’s parent company Alphabet disappointed after the market close in the US. Given the technology sector helped lead US indices to fresh highs in 2018 and is so dominant, its performance in the current earning season was always likely to be pivotal to investor sentiment.As if traders didn’t have enough to contend with, later today we’ll get US GDP data for the third quarter. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spread Ex, says the number could weigh on investor moods:Given that the slightest thing sets the markets off at the moment, it is going to be interesting to see how they deal with this afternoon’s first look at the US third quarter GDP figure. Let’s take a closer look at the markets in Europe, where losses are accelerating this morning:As well as the disappointing results (on some measures) from Amazon and Alphabet, investors are also concerned by a number of other risks. To name a few - the USChina trade war, rising US interest rates, instability in emerging markets, and Brexit.Here is our story on how the market volatility has gripped Asian and Australian markets overnight:Opening bells have rung across Europe and the mood is gloomy:David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, explains why Amazon and Alphabet disappointed investors:We heard from tech giants Amazon and Alphabet after the closing bell last night. Amazon topped the earnings per share forecast, but missed on revenue and the guidance. Google’s parent, Alphabet, exceeded estimates on EPS, but undershot the revenue forecast. Both stocks dropped heavily in the post-market session, and in turn sparked selling across major US indices. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.We’re almost at the end of what has been a hugely volatile week for global stock markets.But sentiment soured when US tech giants Amazon and Alphabet reported disappointing revenues after the closing bell on Wall Street. It was enough to send US futures lower, which in turn triggered a sell-off in Asia where shares hit 20-month lows.Markets across Europe are expected to open sharply lower this morning as the gloomy sentiment spreads across the Atlantic:We will be following the markets and all the latest business news as this volatile week for global markets draws to a close."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dc57d9b40a195b094b5f2c79ad0e095e9e0fe54/27_0_3325_1996/master/3325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac0f6ae074400775577dfb3c5c55396d","title":"what it feels like to cross the worlds longest sea bridge hong kong china","story":"There are moments of awe while travelling across the brand new Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge, but finding the on ramp isn’t easyKenny Li is waiting patiently at a coach terminus in Kowloon on a misty and cold Hong Kong morning.He is planning to have lunch in the Chinese city of Zhuhai, which on a normal day would take him about four hours to reach by road. But today the journey will take just over 30 minutes, because today is not a normal day.Kenny is one of scores of passengers – including your correspondent – who are queuing for a seat on one of the first cross-border coaches to travel over the newly-opened Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge.The $20bn, 55km bridge and 6.7km undersea tunnel link Hong Kong’s Lantau island to Zhuhai on the southern coast of Guangdong province and the gambling hub of Macau, a popular tourist spot for Chinese visitors. The mega-structure is supported by three cable-stayed bridges and designed to withstand typhoon-force winds of up to 340km an hour.It took almost eight years to build and, according to ambitious plans hatched in Beijing, will help form a high-tech and economic region, namely Greater Bay Area, to rival New York, San Francisco and Tokyo bay areas.But those lofty aims feel fairly irrelevant to the band of eager passengers who have assembled at the Kowloon coach terminus on Wednesday morning. This group wants something different from the HZMB, as it has become known. For just HK$120 (£11) for a single trip ticket, we can be part of history.Private cars can only travel on the bridge with a special permit, which is not easy and costly to obtain. So, taking the cross-border coach is the quickest and easiest way to become one of the first members of the public to travel on the bridge.“I was the first person to get the ticket three days ago,” says Li, as he waits patiently for our white and green Chinalink coach to arrive.Other passengers are similarly excited. YW Cheung and his wife bought the tickets on Sunday as soon as he heard about the news about coach companies running the bridge service.“I want to take the first coach to cross the bridge,” he said. “We will meet friends in Zhuhai and eat out with them, and then we will go to Macau.”But before we can take our place in the annals of human transportation, we have to find our way on to the bridge. Once everyone is boarded we leave the coach station at 8.45am. By 9.30am we are a bit lost.Our driver, who is also on his first trip across the structure, is having trouble finding the right lane to take onto the bridge at Hong Kong port. The crossing is so new that road signs haven’t quite caught up. Anxiety among the passengers rises slightly. Will Li and Cheung’s lunch plans fall apart?In the end, a red-faced coach company representative has to flag down some passing police officers and ask them to escort us onto the right ramp. “The announcement on the opening of the bridge was sudden, we barely had enough time to familiarise ourselves with the new roads,” he explains.After a quick check by border control our coach finally makes its way onto the bridge. From here it is much smoother sailing. At first, the sea crossing feels like an ordinary drive on a three-lane highway, except instead of being surrounded by rolling countryside, we are flanked by a vast expanse of water. The sea is flat with no waves and the sky is foggy. The road itself is largely empty with the occasional port-to-port shuttle bus travelling in the opposite direction.Soon the road slopes down to an artificial island where we enter a 44-metre deep underwater tunnel. After five minutes under the ground, we are back in the open air.At this moment the scale of the project really hits. A ship that seems toy-sized is plying the sea below us. At times, you can see the whole bridge, hanging high above the water. The sea seems endless.The feeling of awe doesn’t last long. Minutes later our trip ends abruptly. We arrive in China. The crossing had taken approximately half an hour. The lunch dates are saved. There are broad smiles all round. As we enter the Zhuhai checkpoint, a sign reads “No photos”. This is China after all.The sea crossing has been controversial throughout its seven-year construction period. Budget overruns (from HK$7.76bn to HK$120bn – or $990m to $15.3bn), worker deaths and construction delays have dogged the project.In Hong Kong there were fears that the bridge served – above all – a political purpose to bring the territory closer to its motherland at a time when politically sensitive locals were panicking over anything related to integration with China. Officials, however, claimed the new link between Hong Kong, China and Macau would boost flows of people, logistics, trade and money.On the return journey to Hong Kong, mainlander Yin Qingyun is taking the coach to Hong Kong. The retired civil servant from Yunnan had made the trip to Zhuhai to witness the bridge’s opening. She said that she felt very emotional that Hong Kong, China and Macau could finally unite “like the same family”.Not everyone is happy though.

If I could distribute travel-size dispensers into every jacket pocket I possessed, no germs would dare to come near me. (They did.)Windows were a thing one year fresh air would do the trick. (It didn’t.) I’ve never gone as far as the Sars mask, but I have definitely gone through mad phases of not holding the pole in the subway.The real answer, I know, is to eat and sleep better but this seems unachievable, or at least deeply uninteresting without some programmatic element with grander marketing promises to make me immortal. And so this year, after everyone in my household promptly got sick three days into autumn and has been engaged in a relay race of infections ever since, it’s meal prep. If I can make my fridge look like a trolley on an airplane, we will hack this cold season and emerge fighting fit in the spring.In this, at least, I am helped by the food preparation services of New York, which have proliferated in the last few years so that any requirement can be met and delivered to your door. If you’re on a blockbuster diet – Paleo, say, or the Whole30 – there is a company that will deliver those meals every day. There is a new company devoted to “fitness” meal plans, which seems to involve the same combination of protein, carb and fibre as its competitors, with the exception that every meal comes with a jaunty fitness-inspired name: “bodybuilder’s essential white rice”, for example, or “athlete chicken teriyaki”.Actually, I tried that last one this week and the chicken did look like it had done a hard workout. The homespun version of all this is meal-prep Sunday, a movement on Instagram and elsewhere in which people post photos of a week’s worth of meals they have prepared on Sunday night. It is supposed to encourage, but something about the image of seven salads in mason jars or a week’s worth of neatly deconstructed chilli bowls fills me with despair.The difficulty is primarily one of scale. Left to my own devices I will eat any old crust I can find lying around, and seem to have existed for three years solely on leftover fish fingers, so clearly there is work to be done. But the outsourcing impulse, or the adoption of radical new habits, is a piece of avoidance that ends up like all other grand schemes – in the bin.The sensible thing, I know, is simply to shop better, which doesn’t mean panic-buying 75 kiwis and, over the course of two weeks, watching them slowly disintegrate on top of the microwave. Still, it is hard to let go of the idea there is something better out there, something bolder and more definitive in its results.And so I go back to the internet. “Avoid contact with people who are sick,” seems to be the main headline on more than one health website, which in my case would mean moving to a separate house from my children. After another night of coughing, I think I have finally found the answer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fce0d07f92867204f3e6c55f1fc10b2d901eba3f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1102c758d30b2a32abe310d455ecf73c","title":"ending austerity detoxify tories theresa may","story":"And with one bound, Theresa May is, well, not free exactly. But certainly at liberty to leave the frying pan for the next blazing inferno. The prime minister has survived talk of a leadership challenge in much the way she usually does, which is less by pulling off some dramatic intervention (for all the talk of her “emotional and personal” address to the 1922 Committee, MPs coming out of it didn’t seem able to recall a single memorable line) than by letting them have a good hard think about the alternative.People will tolerate a surprising amount when all the other options look dreadful, which is fast becoming the guiding principle of May’s government. But while her modus operandi of grinding opponents down into a state of weary resignation still works reasonably well within her own party, it won’t help with her next challenge, which is delivering on a promise earlier this month to end austerity. Here is the real litmus test of what the Tories actually learned from their 2017 election disaster, and whether they’re capable of doing anything with that knowledge.May’s speech to the party conference already feels like a lifetime (and several leadership crises) ago, easy to forget in all the ensuing melodrama. But on Monday her chancellor must deliver a budget that will now be judged almost solely on whether it fulfils that conference promise – or it will if Labour has anything to do with it, which is why the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is so eager to offer his own definition of what ending austerity really means.Say the A-word, and most people probably think about food banks and rough sleepers, headteachers sending home begging letters asking for cash, or the home affairs select committee saying that underfunded police forces risk becoming almost an “irrelevance” in some areas.Its meaning is now as much emotional as technical, shorthand for a general feeling of things coming apart at the seams – some of which genuinely is due to budget cuts and some of which has more to do with bad decisions. Universal credit has quite understandably come to symbolise everything that’s gone wrong in the past eight years, and it was austerity that carved billions out of Iain Duncan Smith’s original plan to simplify the benefits system, turning it into a cover for smuggling through welfare cuts. But it is the delays and errors and clumsy assumptions built into the system that so often push people into debt in the first place, which means sorting out the mess probably requires both cash and a rethink of how it operates.And what most people expect from the words “ending austerity” goes well beyond the strict economic definition of easing off from cutting the deficit. It’s a general feeling that the sun might finally be coming out again that their own lives are getting easier that they no longer see so many sleeping bags in high street doorways perhaps even that the government accepts it might have gone too far and is genuinely ready to change tack. For without the latter, Hammond could end austerity in the strict economic sense yet barely touch the sides of the political disaffection it’s caused. A technocrat’s budget that grudgingly keeps to the letter, but not what voters surely hoped would be the spirit, of May’s promise would be almost worse than no promise at all.It goes almost without saying that if the Brexit talks collapse, then all Hammond’s efforts are for the birds no chancellor can conjure up a cheery feelgood mood while sick people are stockpiling medicines for fear of running out, or civil servants are talking of chartering ships to bring food aid to Britain. But in the near-miraculous event that Brexit doesn’t go horribly wrong, and even assuming that revised forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility give him a bit of room for generosity, the Tories still have a reckoning with the electorate ahead.For the overriding impression left by that party conference was that most Tories still don’t get exactly why they so nearly lost the last election. Fringe meetings were jam-packed with grassroots members earnestly trying to understand why young people seemingly don’t want to vote for them. But even among those who grasped the peculiar meaning of “young” in this electoral context (not so much Generation Z as people in their 30s and early 40s, with jobs and kids and often mortgages, living in marginal seats) there’s often a curious blind spot.It’s comforting for Tories to blame their unpopularity on the fact that fewer people are becoming homeowners, since that fits with a very conservative idea about the virtues of living in a property-owning democracy. But as important as housing is, it’s very far from being the only problem (school funding cuts are right up there for many of May’s target voters) and it’s not what has retoxified the brand. The damage done not just to their own life prospects but to the social fabric over the past eight years is surely a large part of what has made voting Conservative toxic by association for so many.May hinted rather opaquely at that in her conference speech, saying that the process of getting the deficit down had been “painful”. But if she wants those millennial swing voters back now, she’s arguably going to have to do more than ease off on austerity and hope they obligingly forget it ever happened. She’s going to have to apologise for it, or at the very least acknowledge the damage done, if she genuinely wants people to think it’s over. And in that sense, this budget isn’t really the end of austerity. It’s barely even the end of the beginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/876a42772a28d50d1dffc588f0017e2dc71e8bb7/0_107_1640_984/master/1640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ca27dd4d12f3d66f37d62305214652d","title":"gradgrind ethos school exams special educational needs","story":"There was a boy in my rural primary school who we used to tease as the village idiot. He was popular though, and we fiercely defended him if anyone bullied him. Our two teachers worked hard to fit him into the school and thus the community, and in this they succeeded. I think he was a happy boy. Yet today that school would risk penalties for lowering its test score and accommodating him would damage, not enhance, its reputation. That is the absurd situation in which our schools find themselves.Recent revelations that pupils with special needs are being excluded to improve school performance can be put down to one thing: an obsession with testing. Since public league tables were introduced by John Patten in 1992, they have defined English education. First it was just A-levels, then GCSEs, then Sats, as the cry went out to measure everything.Ministers of both main parties have become obsessed with the OECD’s Pisa tests, a crude way of comparing the incomparable. Under Michael Gove, English schools were to be benchmarked against Chinese ones. Under Nicky Morgan, tougher tests were demanded for six- and seven-year-olds. These were “essential to make British pupils more competitive with students abroad”. Education was treated as a branch of the Olympics.In an attempt to make the important measurable, we have instead made the measurable important. This month we have a first straw in what, it must be hoped, is a wind of change. Ofsted’s boss, Amanda Spielman, has criticised schools “where too much time is spent preparing for tests at the expense of teaching”. This is like the chief of the defence staff joining CND. Ofsted has for years judged schools on “exam floor targets” – the regime that led the last chief inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, to declare that fully “a third of British schools are failing”. That was after nearly three decades of league tables used to score, penalise and humiliate schools and their teachers – before starving them of money.Exams are educational dross to which politicians turn when they can think of nothing else for pupils to do. The new GCSEs last June produced a deluge of criticism for challenging pupils’ mental resilience more than their memory. Such was the pressure that half of London parents bought private tuition. There was a predictable surge in mental stress among children. Examination implies a public loss of faith in the profession of teaching. We don’t judge doctors by patient longevity, or lawyers by cases won. Yet we reduce education simply to what can be recalled on a particular day, even if promptly forgotten. It scores not just children but teachers and schools. A teacher recently wrote to the Times that in Germany, largely exam-free schools “are trusted to educate in the broadest sense, and objectively assess their own pupils, without recourse to any self-serving, outsourced exam industry”. I doubt that a modern English school would know what to do with its time without exams.Askmost people what they remember from school and they mention an inspiring teacher, not an exam result. Ask employers what they look for in a recruit and they list articulation, presentation, creativity, imagination and social skills – qualities that appear nowhere in an English curriculum. They might be the benefits of talented pedagogy, but scoring them is absurd.Pisa, Whitehall and Ofsted are obsessed with maths not because algebra is the key to happiness, or geometry to great riches, but because it is easy to score globally. Bereft of an ideal of a good education, government, and especially central government, likes anything that yields mass data. It holds the key to control, to the regime of rewards and penalties that underpins modern administration and its funding.One day, I believe exams will be as outdated as the slate and the birch. For the time being, we can only bewail those most likely to suffer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cd1cc4049775b04d58e0a3315c5c78cba96e8b1/0_101_3028_1817/master/3028.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ab4d321862f71b694ae8a666dbb8778","title":"russia brexit britain trade wto negotiations liam fox","story":"Liam Fox was finally able to announce the start of a set of trade negotiations yesterday, but they were of a kind he had probably hoped to avoid. The issue is this: as the UK leaves the EU, it must go through a process of certifying its own schedule of goods and services at the World Trade Organization. This schedule is essentially a set of rights and obligations the UK must follow regarding other WTO members. The UK has been part of the EU’s schedule, but now, following Brexit, must set its own independent one.The UK had hoped this would be an uncontroversial technical exercise, and for the most part it has been. This is because the UK intends to replicate as far as possible the EU’s schedule of commitments and concessions, including on tariffs. Where this has become problematic, as expected and even seemingly anticipated by the UK, is on splitting the EU’s current share of tariff rate quotas (TRQs).TRQs essentially set the amount of imports that can enter a country at an agreed low duty rate. Beyond that volume limit, higher tariffs then apply. Unsurprisingly, they are most controversial when it comes to agricultural goods, where the upper limits of many countries’ tariff rates are high. Extracting the UK share from the EU’s current set of TRQs is a delicate exercise. While the EU would be only too happy to offload some of its quotas, other countries want to make sure they are still getting the same market access to Europe for their produce, as well as access to the newly independent UK.The UK and EU together agreed an approach to split their TRQs in a way that still added up to the present quotas for the EU28 as a whole. But a number of countries have protested, both to the UK’s draft proposal and to the EU’s. While Russia’s objection has occupied the headlines, many of Britain’s closest allies have raised concerns as well. Among these are the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The reality is that when it comes to agriculture, special relationships mean little in practice. Everyone’s out for their own as far as meat and dairy go, and trade negotiations sink or swim on these issues.The UK will get its first real taste of this battle as it moves to open the 90-day comment period – the beginning of the negotiating process – for these talks, under article 28 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This means the negotiations could go right up until the UK’s official Brexit date.But while leaving the EU with the UK’s new schedules “uncertified” – that is, without agreement from all other members – is undesirable, it would not be calamitous.A country can trade on uncertified schedules, as the EU itself knows from recent history. With successive rounds of enlargement, it has had to modify its own goods schedules at the WTO to reflect the integration of member states. This has even led to Brussels having to compensate other WTO members for changes to their market access. The process has been a protracted one, so slow that only last year the EU circulated revised goods schedules for all 28 members, meaning it has been operating with uncertified commitments long out of date. Not that you would know it from a day-to-day trading perspective.So as negotiations go, the UK’s schedules snafu is probably something of a storm in a teacup. The government’s negotiations to accede in its own right to the global procurement agreement is more pressing, and reported US moves to challenge Britain’s application could prove thorny.But they all pale into significance when set against the scale of Brexit negotiations. If nothing else, British negotiators are getting a crash course in trade talks. The learning curve is steep, but at least we will emerge less naive about the challenge of turning global Britain’s trade policy into a reality.• Allie Renison is head of Europe and Trade at the Institute of Directors"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862567f818f4a1cc74e0055f3feaade30fc67edf/0_366_5492_3295/master/5492.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46a44b4cfde86046d79b568707b41865","title":"soy destruction deforestation in argentina leads straight to our dinner plates","story":"Argentina’s Gran Chaco forest is being razed for soya, ending up in Europe as animal feed, and on our plates. It’s the backbone of Argentina’s fragile economy, but has come at a price for the indigenous people who live thereby  Uki Goñi in SaltaThe extent of the destruction is painful to see. Flying over the area around the El Corralito indigenous community in a single-propeller plane, only thin strips of green are left between vast fields of pale, newly uncovered earth, pencilled in with parallel white lines of the ashes of bulldozed trees.Only a few years ago, this stretch of land in Argentina’s northern province of Salta was still forest – home to the Wichí people, and part of the gigantic Gran Chaco forest that spreads across northern Argentina and its neighbouring countries Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil. Second only to the Amazon in South America for its size and bioersity, the Gran Chaco covers 250,000 sq miles of dry forest, which is being cut down faster than scientists can study it. Since 1996, when the government authorised the introduction of genetically modified soya bean, Argentina has cleared nearly a quarter of its native forests. Much of that newly cleared land has been turned over to the soya bean crop that has been critical to Argentina’s cyclically ravaged economy. “Argentina is in a forest emergency,” says Natalia Machain, director of Greenpeace Argentina.Once harvested, the small creamy beans are crushed. The extracted oil is mainly used for fuel, while the remaining meal – the protein – is used for animal feed. Only a small percentage is turned into human food products such as soy milk. Around 43m tonnes of soya bean meal, soya oil and soya bean a year floods out of Argentina and into Russia, the Middle East, Australia and Asia, with the largest part going to Europe and Europe’s farms.Argentina is Europe’s largest single supplier of soya bean meal, providing more than a third of total European soya meal imports, 9.8m tonnes out of a total 27.1m in 2016.A number of major food companies, most notably the fast food company McDonald’s, have pledged to axe deforestation from their global supply chains. The European Union itself has made a number of impressive sounding noises on the subject. But when it comes to traceability, Argentina lags far behind its giant neighbour Brazil, which has more controls in place because of its history with deforestation in the Amazon.“The truth is that at the moment decent traceability of soya bean in Argentina is a black box, and while it remains a black box, Argentina’s forests are going under the axe,” says Toby Gardner, an environmental expert at the Stockholm Environment Initiative intent on providing traceability for South America’s exports. The Roundtable on Sustainable Soy is working to try to improve things, but has had limited success. A team sent to Argentina by the US-based NGO Mighty Earth came up against a brick wall recently trying to determine what percentage of Argentina’s soya bean originates from deforested areas. “There is no legal requirement for companies to document the geographic origin of their soya bean or provide evidence that it has been produced legally,” Mighty Earth says in a report on the trip released earlier this year. “As such, it is currently impossible for European companies that source from these traders to ensure that the soya bean they are buying has not been produced through deforestation.”European supermarket chains frequently market their meat and dairy products as sustainable and locally produced, but the feed consumed by the livestock often comes from thousands of miles away, says Mighty Earth. “As such, the locally grown labelling only represents half the truth about the origins of this meat.”Mighty Earth says the environmental commitments of food companies are difficult to uphold if livestock raised in Europe is fed with soya meal from a country where traceability remains opaque. “Consumers want to know where products come from and want their food to be produced in a manner consistent with their values,” says Glenn Hurowitz of Mighty Earth. “We’ve made great advances regarding traceability of soya bean from the Amazon but we have been blind to the deforestation happening in Argentina.”Meanwhile the Wichí people helplessly stand by as their home disappears. “We have no future,” says Amancio Angel despairingly. He is standing next to a clump of trees, the only home left to his clan after another swath of green was uprooted earlier this year by giant bulldozers hauling chains through the dwindling forest. “We used that forest to hunt and collect fruit, people from other communities got honey there, now life has become impossible,” says Amancio.Now it is almost totally gone, part of 9,000 hectares (an area about one-and-a-half times the size of Manhattan island) earmarked for deforestation by just one out of a total 32 deforestation permits issued in recent years by Salta’s provincial authorities.Nonetheless, in response to pressure from environmental groups to halt the rampant deforestation, Argentina’s congress passed a law that went into effect in 2009 iding the country’s forestland into red (untouchable), yellow (mixed use) and green (available to deforest) areas. Unfortunately for communities such as El Corralito, the law has been honoured more in the breach than in the observance, with inidual provinces authorising vast deforestation projects in red and yellow protected zones. In Salta, for example, more than 170,000 protected hectares – an area larger than Greater London – have gone under the bulldozer since the law came into force.Earlier this year the national government was forced to intervene, and a moratorium was put in place in Salta. But the deforestation continues, according to Greenpeace Argentina. The local governor, Juan Manuel Urtubey, a good looking and softly spoken 49-year-old politician who has ruled Salta since 2007, and is a likely candidate in Argentina’s upcoming 2019 presidential elections, may have handed out plenty of permits himself but he frowns on the landowners who have continued clearing land after the moratorium was imposed in January.“Clearings carried out outside the framework of the law are a crime and administrative and judicial instances are under way so that those who committed that crime pay their responsibility,” he says.The problem is that the law sets only moderate monetary fines for offenders. “The fines are no deterrent at all, producers just factor them in as another cost,” says Noemí Cruz, an indigenous campaigner for Greenpeace in Salta.“What producers have done to get around the forest law is obtain written statements from community chiefs agreeing to deforestation in exchange for houses and water deliveries,” says Ana Alvarez, a lawyer who defends indigenous rights. “These statements, often signed with a thumbprint by Wichís who cannot read or write Spanish, are then used by landowners to obtain deforestation permits from the province.”Governor Urtubey vows that he is taking the deforestation issue seriously. “We are discussing a law to duplicate the size of protected areas in Salta,” Urtubey tells the . “So we’ll have 4m hectares of protected areas and 2m hectares of agriculture. We’re working with the national government, environmental organisations and producers on how to reduce the environmental impact of productive activities evaluating on a case-by-case basis.”The effect is not only felt by the Wichí. Soya bean has created a rural exodus from dairy- and beef-producing areas, displacing local farmers in favour of mechanised production by giant conglomerates who wield tremendous economic influence. The sight of the horseback “gaucho”, Argentina’s equivalent of the US cowboy, trailed by dogs, has disappeared from the landscape. Many landowners have knocked down their farmhouses to make more space for soya bean.During a two-hour drive across dirt roads in Salta, once peopled by gauchos, farming families, horses and dogs, the only traffic encountered was a lorry with a trailer hauling a giant bulldozer to cut down more forest, followed by a small tractor pulling a cistern carrying fuel for the tree-killer.The short-term benefit for Argentina’s economy comes at a heavy price. “Soya bean devastates native forests and decreases the infiltration capacity of soils,” says the indigenous campaigner Cruz. “Its associated agrochemicals pollute the water table and aquifers. In the Gran Chaco area there is little water to start with, so the contamination of natural water sources is doubly serious.” The salinisation of the soil, which renders it unusable for further planting, is another problem associated with soya bean production.John Palmer, a British anthropologist who has been living in Salta since the 1990s says the message for the Wichí is: “Bye-bye indigenous people. This world is not a place for you. The world is a place for us, the big spenders, the big money grabbers – that’s who the world is for.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03685a3da671e9d00b210937187d029b11952de1/605_121_4781_2868/master/4781.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e6d233b1aaae9aeebe0e107844f2d46","title":"how tattoos went from subculture to pop culture","story":"Body art is more mainstream than ever although for many, it is no longer a design for lifeWhen Nathan Boon started working as a tattoo artist about 10 years ago, tattoo parlours could be found in back alleys or on the outskirts of town. Over the years, as trends have moved from tribal designs on the lower back to geometric designs on the sternum, he’s seen more shops open up in central business districts. “When I first started, you had to go and find someone to tattoo you. Now it’s in your face,” he said.The Manchester Tattoo Emporium, where he works, is in the city’s most central shopping area. On a weekday afternoon business is booming in the studio, which opened four years ago. The company has three other studios – the first of which opened six years ago and the newest one a year ago. “There are more kids now than ever who have tattoos,” said Boon. “It’s not a taboo thing any more.”Earlier this week, England and Chelsea footballer Ross Barkley, spoke publicly about his decision to remove a whole sleeve of tattoos, including one that marked his first game with his previous club Everton.“I got them at a young age and sometimes when you are young you do stupid things and do not think about it,” the 24-year-old midfielder told the Times. “But I went into it too quick and over the years I felt I wanted to get them removed.” He added that he would not rule out getting more tattoos in the future.After being shown a picture of Barkley’s tattooed arm, Boon said he was not surprised by the decision. “I can see why he’s taken them off because it’s a whole bunch of different styles that don’t really go together. He was probably in a rush to get tattooed,” he said. “If you get tattoos for the sake of getting them, you can regret them a few years down the line.”“If more people are getting tattoos then there will be a market for more removal,” said Boon, who attributes the rise in popularity to the influence of celebrities and social media. “I say to my clients all the time, be careful of the choices you make because what I liked when I was 20 is not what I like now.”Chris Bull, the marketing director at Sk:n, which has 51 skin clinics in the UK, says demand for laser tattoo removal has increased significantly over the past five years. “I would argue that it is because tattoos are becoming more popular so people are choosing to change them or adapt them over time,” he said.David McComb, journalist and author of 100 Years of Tattoos, said: “Tattoos have always gone in and out of fashion throughout history. The best example is that back in the early 1900s there was a craze in high society for tattoos. Famously, Winston Churchill’s mother had a snake tattooed around her wrist. Literally, within about five years it had gone completely out of fashion again.“Whereas my generation would think about it for a long time, young people don’t think twice about going to get a tattoo,. They have a more relaxed attitude towards body art and, if they don’t like it in a few years, they’ll just get something else to cover it up.”McComb believes that we are living through a period of high tattoo popularity, which is unlikely to last forever. “If I had tonnes of money I’d certainly invest in a tattoo removal machine,” he said. “I think it’s something that’s going to become very, very popular over the next few years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fca748be1f135d5200038b5258c7cf082096bf5/0_7_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8dec2d266499b3c98953e89b4fdfd56a","title":"bohemian rhapsody from the doors to behind the candelabra which classic biopic is best","story":"With the long-awaited Bohemian Rhapsody finally released, here are the best music biopics rated on dodgy plots, bad wigs and nightmarish productionRegardless of genre or the iniduals in question, music biopics generally follow the same narrative.

Kilmer’s hair – which goes through three distinct, shaggy iterations – is his own.Cast Kilmer is so perfect as Morrison – knocking around hips-first into doorways and wearing scarves over an open shirt and being blown in an elevator – that he had to go to therapy post-production to “get Jim out of his head”.Unnecessary songs There are a couple of unnecessary performances, but most of the time it’s Kilmer-as-Jim singing and everyone else in the band looking at each other, amazed, just stunned to even be in the same room as him, which I imagine is: not how it happened.Production nightmare The biopic was first mooted in 1985, with Brian De Palma, Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin all taken with the idea of making it at various points. After Oliver Stone wrote three scripts and begged with everyone depicted, it finally hit screens in 1991. It’s genuinely amazing that six years of working on a script didn’t come up with something more than “JIM MORRISON does ACID in a way that SEEMS IMPORTANT. Everyone WANTS TO SLEEP WITH HIM.

Slade fakes his own death at his final concert then disappears off the face of the earth: Stuart, now a grumpy Manc journalist, tracks down those who were close to him to retell his mythological story and try to figure the mystery out. Oscar Wilde is involved for some reason. The whole thing is inexplicably a Citizen Kane rip-off. Eddie Izzard’s in it. It’s a lot.Wigs A lot of wigs, yeah. Rhys Meyers had to portray Davi– sorry, Brian Slade’s early hippy hair, his alien blue final form, and every chop and cut in between. Ewan McGregor had to wear something blond and Iggy Poppish to play Curt Wild.Cast Bale is pitch-perfect as Just a Simple Northern Lad What Wants to Shag David Bowie, and Rhys Meyers is almost painfully beautiful as Slade. Ewan McGregor’s gravelly American accent could … have used some work.Unnecessary songs Seeing as the film had to pretend all the characters were works of fiction and Bowie refused to license any of the songs, a team of musicians were hired to form the fictional Venus in Furs, including Thom Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Bernard Butler and Andy Mackay. Anyway, there are still two too many songs.Production nightmare Pretty straightforward job, this one.Rating Two aliens out of five.Plot Anna Mae Bullock (Angela Bassett) is abandoned by her mother as a child, which just completely messes her up and gives her massive abandonment issues. She goes to St Louis to reunite with her and immediately falls in love with Ike Turner (Laurence Fishburne) instead, a rich musical genius and a complete dickhead. They quickly marry, have a kid, and start a hugely successful career together, before Ike turns abusive and Tina learns exactly one Buddhist chant.

Fishburne turned down playing Ike five times.Rating Four rivers out of five mountains.Plot Maniacally flamboyant pianist Liberace (Michael Douglas) decides to turn his toyboy lover Scott Thorson (Matt Damon) into him via a series of rudimentary facial surgeries. Then he gets bored with banging himself so bangs someone else. Long story short: Liberace dies.Wigs There are … a fantastic number of wigs. Douglas’s Liberace is poised, posture-perfect in heavy crystal-studded outfits, tan and tight-faced, which makes it genuinely quite revolting when it cuts to scenes of him sagging out of the shower in a bald cap or hairlessly having his face sliced open with a saw.Cast Douglas was already past the age Liberace lived to by the time filming began Damon, playing apparently a wide-eyed 18-year-old at the start of the film, was 42 the show is stolen entirely by Rob Lowe, face taped to the back of his own head, playing the pair’s speed-dealing Hollywood surgeon.Unnecessary shots of a song that are only really put in there because the lead actor went so far as to learn the entire song None. Douglas absolutely did not bother to learn piano for this one, so all the performances are probably his head CGI’d on to a more adept body.Production nightmare The idea of a Liberace biopic came to director Soderbergh in 2000 in 2008, he began adapting Thorson’s memoir, with Douglas and Damon signing on later that year production took four years as the team struggled to secure studio funding and shooting was also delayed by Douglas’s 2010 cancer diagnosis.Rating Five candelabras out of five."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffd6b8375c67e065618edda0de539112c460602f/0_81_2643_1587/master/2643.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff21437e5b8c67f0010e8a339a146495","title":"clueless remake paramount tracy oliver","story":"Paramount orders remake of the 1995 hit based on Jane Austen’s Emma from Girls Trip writer Tracy OliverClueless, the much-loved teen comedy, which catapulted Alicia Silverstone and Brittany Murphy to fame in the mid-90s, is to be remade by Paramount.

Now, two new major retrospectives aim to introduce her work to modern audiences Box knew of what she spoke. Fifty-four years since her final film, she remains Britain’s most prolific female director. In the 1950s, she strived and scrimped, surmounted institutional prejudice and ill-health to make her 13 features. Now, they are being seriously re-examined, with major retrospectives at this year’s San Sebastián and Lumière festivals. Audiences are finding Box isn’t just worthy of interest because of her outrider status, but because of her quest to find adventurous new expressions of women’s lives.Beyond the baseline of independently minded female characters, Box singled out emerging areas for women workers, such as the police (in 1953’s Street Corner), and touched on taboos such as child prostitution and venereal disease (1960’s Too Young to Love). Even a crowdpleaser such as 1957’s The Passionate Stranger, about a strapping but dim Italian chauffeur who mistakes the romantic fiction of his novelist boss for wish fulfilment, couches its feminism in a bluff and surprising way. As the hired hand reads his boss’s work – in which a pent-up concert pianist romances her driver – the action shifts from black and white into gaudy colour. Written by Box and her producer husband Sydney, this tentative postmodernism feels like the couple having fun satirising how domestic tensions filter into fiction. But never mind the would-be Latin lover’s assumptions about women’s fiction. Writing simply serves a straightforward purpose – economic self-sufficiency and enjoyment – for Margaret Leighton’s novelist, who gives her suitor the brushoff.Despite winning a screenplay Oscar for the 1946 melodrama The Seventh Veil, Box struggled to make the next step to director. The couple’s projects were repeatedly turned down, but Sydney persuaded Gainsborough Studios to let his wife reshoot portions of Cockpit, a Richard Attenborough wartime vehicle eventually released as The Lost People.The pair formed their own company: London Independent Producers. First up was The Happy Family, but despite business arrangements designed to afford her more control, Box came up against the same old attitudes. The received wisdom was that innate “sensitivity” made women better editors than directors. On The Happy Family, Sydney told casting directors that he and Box would co-direct, then let his wife call the shots.Sometimes initiating projects through their company, sometimes working for the big British outfits, Box had to decide how feasibly she could challenge the existing framework of the industry – and wider society around it. Her sister-in-law Betty Box (AKA Betty Box Office) became a powerhouse producer, married to future Carry On honcho Peter Rogers – but Box never fully gave herself over to prevailing commercial mores. Even the relatively benign The Happy Family, with its bickering cockney family defending their house from demolition, had an unusually female slant. Her last film, 1964’s Rattle of a Simple Man – featuring Steptoe and Son’s Harry H Corbett as a Mancunian bachelor on a lad’s away day in Soho who scores himself an improbable evening with Diane Cilento’s buxom escort girl – seems to cede to the nudge-wink Carry On vogue. But it mocks male priapism and conducts an almost anguished examination of power relations between the sexes.Making room for outsider perspectives sometimes meant stretching existing forms, as in The Passionate Stranger. Sometimes Box just delights in experimentation for its own sake. The riotous Simon \u0026amp Laura, from 1954 – about a quarrelsome OlivierLeigh-esque pair of married actors forced to put on a show of harmony for their new show – anticipates reality TV. It’s when Box is handling her most explicitly feminist themes that her artistic seams can show. Just as such debates were unresolved in 1950s Britain, her films occasionally have the feel of an argument being worked through in real time. Too Young to Love, in which a juvenile-court judge attempts to fathom why a 15-year-old girl would begin taking money and gifts for sex, becomes tortuously snagged on the generational conflict between mother and child. For the teenager, slipping into prostitution is a form of self-liberation from an oppressive household the mother can’t accept her rejection of the haven she has slaved to create.It’s interesting that in both Too Young to Love and Rattle of a Simple Man, Box equates female autonomy to some extent with prostitution, as if society at the time deemed both beyond the pale. But the two characters have self-assuredness and moral courage. There’s similar conviction in how frank Box’s films often are about sex, even when they’re old-fashioned in other ways. Too Young to Love makes a bald plot point out of abortion, still illegal when the film was released. Cilento, in Rattle of a Simple Man, looks like a swinging 60s glamourpuss, but her guilt-free attitude to sex is less self-consciously saucy than an acknowledgement that women should dictate and enjoy their sex lives. It’s not clear how much Box did, but – with her first boyfriend a colleague of her father’s more than a decade older than her – she seems at least to have a firm disregard for convention.Perhaps that self-assertion is what allowed her to pull through when Sydney, despite his facilitating role in her career, didn’t turn out to be such an ally. In 1964, an intercepted phone call revealed he had been keeping a mistress in another London house. He later admitted he had never been serially unfaithful during their 30 years of marriage.They orced in 1969 with her works struggling at the box office, her directorial career didn’t survive the wreckage. She later founded Britain’s first feminist publisher, Femina Press, and her parliamentary campaigning led to meeting and eventually marrying the lord chancellor, Gerald Gardiner. Her films fell into the abyss of the unwatched until her name resurfaced in the 90s.There’s a note of disquiet in critic Elisa McCausland’s essay for the San Sebastián retrospective, about the need to periodically remind that Box and her fellow pioneers existed: “We might wonder if these cyclical recovery strategies are not a sign of essential failure. If we have to unearth the same names every couple of decades, instead of definitively including them in the history of cinema, it is because something about them does not appeal beyond political and cultural cosmetic operation.” Hopefully, more opportunity to see Box’s brisk sketchwork of the battle of the sexes on the big screen will settle that debate.

There was plenty of excitement when they signed Fred from Shakhtar Donetsk in the summer but the Brazil international has not been given many opportunities to demonstrate his abilities. He has been a substitute since scoring on his last start – the 1-1 home draw with Wolves – and must be wondering what he has to do earn a place in Mourinho’s starting 11. Nemanja Matic struggled again during the midweek defeat to Juventus and looked cumbersome during last weekend’s draw with Chelsea. Perhaps Mourinho should consider giving Fred a chance to develop a relationship with Paul Pogba when United host Everton on Sunday. JS• How well has Mourinho spent money at Manchester United?• Mourinho denies FA charge of using offensive languageUnai Emery’s Arsenal revolution has been built on a series of minor tweaks, slotting players into different positions to create a deep, versatile squad capable of consistency in the league and in Europe. One player who has had to adapt more than most is Mesut Özil, shifted from one wing to the other in the Premier League before Monday’s home win over Leicester. Returned to the No10 role and given the captain’s armband, Özil struggled until a goal just before half-time sparked a breathtaking inidual and collective second-half display. He has surely earned the right to continue as the team’s creative linchpin at Selhurst Park, where Palace are yet to score at home this season. The challenge for Özil and Arsenal will be to unpick a stubborn home defence and extend the visitors’ winning run to 12 games. NM• Welbeck pounces to give Arsenal Europa League win over Sporting• Are Arsenal genuine contenders for the Premier League title?Cardiff have played Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Tottenham and now face Liverpool, but after this game they face none of the current top six and five members of the current bottom half before Spurs visit on New Year’s Day. Indeed, the way Cardiff’s fixtures have fallen has left them with two particularly difficult periods, one from which they will emerge after Saturday, the other falling inconveniently at the end of the season, when their final seven fixtures include games against Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool and Manchester United. Being out of the bottom three – thanks largely to last weekend’s 4-2 win over Fulham – is significantly ahead of rational expectation and leaves Neil Warnock’s side looking ahead with optimism to the possibility a relatively enjoyable, bookmaker-confounding few months. Once they get this potentially morale-shattering fixture out of the way, of course. SB• Quiz: who are the Premier League top goalscorers by country?With Andriy Yarmolenko likely to miss the rest of the season after suffering an achilles injury during last weekend’s defeat to Tottenham, West Ham’s squad is starting to look stretched. Losing the Ukrainian winger is a blow for Manuel Pellegrini, especially with Felipe Anderson flitting in and out of form and Marko Arnautovic struggling to shake off a knee injury. Candidates to fill Yarmolenko’s spot on the right for Saturday evening’s trip to Leicester City include Michail Antonio and Robert Snodgrass and it will not be a surprise if Pellegrini opts for experience. But perhaps West Ham’s manager will be brave enough to give Grady Diangana another opportunity. While the 20-year-old winger is yet to start a Premier League game, he impressed in the crushing Carabao Cup win over Macclesfield Town last month and Pellegrini introduced the rookie instead of Antonio when Yarmolenko collapsed against Tottenham. JS• David Squires on ... Usain Bolt’s comic-book football adventureThere will be plenty of creative talent on show at Wembley on Monday night, with Christian Eriksen and Kevin De Bruyne expected to start. Both returning playmakers will hope the pitch survives an NFL trampling the day before, but if a more direct approach is required, City may have a valuable weapon in Aymeric Laporte. The French centre-back has earned praise for his left-footed, long-range distribution to either flank, and also weighs in with the odd headed goal. City have conceded just once in their last seven games, when Laporte was switched to left-back against Hoffenheim. At centre-back, he has been imperious, tightening Guardiola’s defence and making the leaders almost as tough to break down as they are to keep out at the other end. NM• De Bruyne concerned about playing Spurs at Wembley after NFL game• Guardiola rushed to Manchester Arena to find family after terror attack• Spurs’ academy is succeeding thanks to locally sourced players• Tottenham’s Vorm says: ‘We had to kill PSV game. We know that’This could be a pivotal moment in Jürgen Locadia’s career at Brighton. While Glenn Murray has an outside chance of being passed fit to face Wolves at the Amex Stadium on Saturday afternoon, the expectation is that the veteran striker will be ruled out of contention after suffering a concussion in last weekend’s victory over Newcastle. Chris Hughton is likely to turn to Locadia if that proves to be the case and the Dutch forward, who has not scored since February, will need to make sure that he is ready for a difficult test. Brighton, who are looking for their third consecutive win, rely heavily on Murray for their goals and Locadia has not convinced since his £14m move from PSV Eindhoven in January. This would be a good time for the 24-year-old to end his barren run. JS• Football Weekly Extra: defensive rocks to dazzling DortmundThere might not be much positivity in the air when Southampton host Newcastle on Saturday afternoon. On the one hand, Newcastle’s wretched history in this fixture – one point from their last five visits, conceding 15 goals – means their long-suffering fans will expect the worst on their way to the south coast. An increasingly gloomy Rafael Benítez has already said that Newcastle need to find three worse teams in order to escape relegation, but despite the worrying statistics, his side will regard this as a fine opportunity to earn their first win of the season. Southampton have gone four league games without a goal, sit a point above the bottom three, , and their worries will increase if they cannot muster any ruthlessness against the ision’s bottom side. JS• Belgium top Fifa rankings while win in Spain lifts England to fifthBournemouth have made a strong start, tucked in behind the runaway top five, but there is still room for improvement – particularly in front of goal. Eddie Howe’s side have averaged an impressive 12 shots per game so far this season, but are statistically among the league’s most wasteful sides, with striker Callum Wilson particularly guilty of profligacy. They put just two of their nine shots on target in the stalemate with Southampton, and fired 14 efforts wide of goal in the 4-0 defeat to Burnley. By contrast, Bournemouth put four past both Watford and Leicester despite creating less chances than their opponents, showing what they can do when their collective eye is in. Fulham’s porous defence will surely offer up plenty of chances on Saturday – the trick is taking them. NM• Europa League roundup: Celtic lose at Leipzig, Milan beaten by BetisIn their last home game Watford were routed 4-0 by Bournemouth, and with those memories still fresh their next visitors are walking reminders of a similarly disastrous performance last December, which ended with Huddersfield winning 4-1. “Last year it was a good game for the team and for me as well,” said Florent Depoitre, whose goal at Vicarage Road was his fourth of last season – there have been two more in 27 league appearances since. “It was a really big win for us, so I am hoping we can repeat the scenario. We need to get points now.” Watford are a different proposition this season under Javi Gracia, and despite failing to win any of their last five games before last week’s 2-0 success at Wolves have performed admirably in every fixture except one having also lost at Huddersfield last season, they have a score to settle here. SBChelsea have not lost in any competition since the Community Shield, while Burnley have won only twice in 16 matches this season, and last week fell 5-0 at Manchester City. But a perfect illustration of football’s unpredictability can be found in the game played between these teams on this weekend nearly a century ago, in 1921. On that occasion Burnley were the overwhelming favourites: they were league leaders and reigning champions, while a week earlier Chelsea had lost 5-0 – to Burnley. That was the ninth victory in the Clarets’ first 11 games of the season while their opponents had won just once, and Jack Cock had scored every one of Chelsea’s humble tally of six goals. But despite it all the Londoners, said the , “astonished everybody by their performance”, winning 4-1. “On the face of it there could be only one result,” wrote the Observer, but “Chelsea obliged their many supporters, some of whom had almost given them up, by giving Burnley a really good hiding.” (Unpredictability was all the rage: on the same weekend Aston Villa, beaten 5-0 at Middlesbrough the week before, thumped the same opponents 6-2 while Manchester United, who had gone down 4-1 at Manchester City, prevailed 3-1.) So, in short, it’s a funny old game.

Take SD Compostela: for most of their existence they’ve played in the Spanish regional leagues, but their four seasons in the top flight in the mid-1990s just happened to coincide with one of the greatest inidual campaigns football has ever seen. Pretty much everyone outside of Spain remembers them for one moment, in a game they lost 5-1.Ronaldo scored 47 goals in 1996-97, his only season at Barcelona, but it isn’t the numbers that make nostalgics go moist at the eye. At the most basic level, what thrilled in that season was his combination of speed and delicacy, impossible control at implausible pace, one of those rare players who appealed both viscerally and cerebrally. “I’m just a regular player – he’s on another planet,” said Juan Antonio Pizzi, the poor sod who occasionally had to deputise for him.Of those goals, it’s tempting to nominate the one, in a hat-trick against Valencia, scored after he barrelled through an imperceptible gap between two defenders, like the Millennium Falcon bursting out of the second Death Star before it exploded. Or another against Deportivo, when he is fouled, the ball returns to him while he’s on the floor facing away from goal: he gets up, races past two defenders and scores before anyone else realises what’s going on.And then, of course, there’s the one against Compostela, on a drizzly October evening in 1996.It all starts innocently enough. In the 36th minute Gica Popescu wins the ball in the Barcelona half, stabbing it vaguely in the direction of the centre circle, where Ronaldo loomed. Even though Ronaldo was in the early weeks of his career in Spain, the Compostela defenders already know enough to realise they’re in trouble. In their panic, two cartoonishly collide, and the ball breaks loose again.Ronaldo skips away from the defender pile-up and goes after the ball, where he’s met by midfielder Saïd Chiba. Perhaps mindful that conventional weapons are of no use here, Chiba immediately gives up any pretence winning the ball and goes for the basic solution of trying to foul Ronaldo.He does that six times: a hook to the back of the left leg which nearly takes Ronaldo down a sweep to his left ankle then another then he takes a meaty fistful of Kappa shirt, attempting to haul his man back via Italian sportswear that drags Ronaldo back for just long enough to attempt another kick then a final, desperate barge into his back.The fouls succeed as far as to give the brief impression Ronaldo had lost control of the ball, but with a speed of thought that convinces you his brains must be in his feet, he stops it with his studs for just long enough that Chiba thinks he’s got him, and curtails his assault.No dice. Ronaldo breaks free, Chiba looking like a man who’s just vainly tried to prevent a horse bolting from a stable. Two years later Chiba, a Moroccan international, nearly finished the job he tried to start, planting his studs into Ronaldo’s thigh during a 1998 World Cup group match. It didn’t work then either: Ronaldo scored in a 3-0 win for Brazil.At this stage, everyone in the stadium has their eyes on Ronaldo, jaws slackening – absolutely everyone, including Compostela goalkeeper Fernando Peralta. “He stopped and he started again and when I saw him coming I was thinking: ‘Oh my God, this guy is amazing,’” Fernando said. Even if you were playing against Ronaldo, even though you were being paid to stop him, you couldn’t help but turn into a gawping child, staring in wonder at this act of God in Nike boots.Ronaldo cuts back inside, a brief lateral interlude which allowed Ramón to almost catch up, when he and William try to sandwich Ronaldo. But another lightning shimmy, ball transferred from foot-to-foot in less than a blink of the eye, takes care of that.At this stage, Ronaldo almost loses control, the ball escaping beyond his one-yard gravity field for the first time since the halfway line. No matter: obviously nobody else was going to react quicker to this brief escape, and ultimately this nanosecond of lost control only serves to tee up a perfect shooting chance. Then the ball is in the bottom corner.On the sidelines, an assistant coach called José Mourinho celebrates wildly. But manager Bobby Robson clasps his hands to head and almost looks annoyed, as if he’s just seen a goal so good that the continuation of football is now pointless, and he’ll have to find something else to do. “You won’t find a player who can score goals like that,” said Robson after the game. “Can anybody, anywhere, show me a better player?”You know a goal is good when the referee tries muscling in on the credit. “I felt very satisfied with my own part in that goal,” said Victor Esquinas Torres years later. “I could have blown for a foul on him several times but I let him keep going and going … my goodness.”Nike turned it into an advert, footage of the goal garnished only with the slogan “What if you asked God to make you the best soccer player in the world? And he was actually listening?” If even marketing people step back and decide on the “less is more” approach, it suggests something quite special.It’s a shame that Barcelona fans can never quite enjoy this goal fully. Ronaldo left for Inter amid such acrimony that he didn’t even win the club’s player of the year award, with Luis Enrique nominated by the fans instead. “I’d prefer to have scored it with Real Madrid, to be honest,” he told a Spanish TV show in 2016, nominating it as his favourite of his 414 career strikes.In retrospect, it’s all quite poignant. When we see someone do something this good, there’s always a half-assumption (hope?) they’ll be that good forever. He continued being that version of Ronaldo for another couple of years, but then came the World Cup final and the ruinous knee injuries. He was brilliant for years afterwards and his greatest achievements came post-2002 comeback, but as a spectacle he was merely human. Plenty of goals came, but none as awe-inspiring.Still, some were underwhelmed. Compostela’s president José María Caneda looked on and decided he’d seen better. “Ronaldo’s goal was shitty,” Caneda concluded. “He stumbled through and if I was there, I’d make sure to nudge him and then we’d see if it happened.” You really can’t please everyone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5dd7c8cfd92c8a5d324bb18172c24ceac924582/0_301_4490_2693/master/4490.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ce544e78ec9b130e8aea17c30b06221","title":"premier league clasico news and fifa latest weekend football countdown live","story":"Quick line from the courtsthe world of Antonio Conte: reports in Italy (specifically from Sportmediaset) that Conte has finally come to an agreement with Chelsea over his contract.

Gianni Infantino has confirmed that AP story from earlier that they will “bolster the consultation process” and “set up a task force” about the Fifa World Cup Clubglobal Nations League reforms.If you want, should you wish to punish yourself for some non-specific reason, you can watch the Fifa Council question and answer session here.The good news is that now they’re not having that vote, Fifa have more time to focus on the important issues.Good point, well made...Tell you what’s weird: Aaron Ramsey’s contract situation. According to the man himself, a deal had basically been agreed, but it was withdrawn for reasons unclear. He said:Hopefully somebody will come up and tell me why. I’ll accept that if there’s a reason. When the time is right, I probably will find out but that hasn’t happened yet. There is no contract on the table at the moment so there is nothing for me to consider or whatever. We all know that the contract was taken away off the table. I’m not sure exactly why because a few weeks before we sort of agreed and I was ready to sign.Here’s Amy Lawrence with some more, from Lisbon last night.Here’s some expanded Mourinho, from our man Jamie Jackson. Features some red hot United team news, which we can summarise thus: they’re all injured, and it’s someone else’s fault.To Barcelona v Real Madrid. With Cristiano Ronaldo now splitting his time between Turin and his lawyers’ office, and Leo Messi nursing a broken arm, this will be the first clasico not involving the big two since 2007. It’s going to be weird. Beyond the actual game, the biggest story around this one is that defeat could be curtains for Julen Lopetegui, said to be on the verge of the big managerial bin anyway, but if they lose to Barca...well. According to Marca, the Real players are keen to keep Lopetegui around, perhaps because of the alternatives (see update at 10.27), or perhaps because of their own guilt at getting another manager sacked. Probably the alternatives thing.If he does go, after all that palaver in the summer, can you think of a manager who has so flamboyantly torpedoed his own career with just one decision?More Mourinho, if you can stand it. Here he is talking about how he can’t rest Romelu Lukaku, who hasn’t scored in eight games and generally looks like he’s playing wearing boots made out of osmium:We are not in the best moment to try to think about resting players or try to find solutions, the solutions is to find the players we have.One day will be and one day he will score and one day his confidence levels will be back to normal, which clearly they are not there but I always feel that.Interesting breaking news from Rob Harris of the Associated Press, on the Fifa proposals (summary at 10.58). Looks like an implosion won’t happen today...A Fifa decision on a $25 billion overhaul of competitions was expected to be delayed again on Friday after opposition from European soccer leaders and clubs intensified.Fifa President Gianni Infantino had hoped to secure an agreement from his council on the concept of revamping the Club World Cup and establishing a Global Nations League. Instead, a taskforce is set to be created to explore in more detail the merits of the new formats, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations ahead of the council meeting were private.By backing down in the face of Uefa opposition, Infantino was likely to avoid the prospect of European representatives carrying out a threat to walk out of the meeting when the new competitions were discussed.Charles Antaki is here to drink milk and throw a cat among the regulation pigeons - and he’s just finished his milk: “The FIFA rule banning extra-time subs is going in the wrong direction. They should make it mandatory that a particularly rubbish player from each side is removed every minute, preferably selected by public chanting, whistling and booing, and replaced by someone from the crowd who has spent the entire match claiming that their 12-year old could do better. Or indeed, by the 12-year old.”Big news: from this weekend the yellow ball returns to the Premier League. Do we care? Will you notice? Are any of you going to join me in refusing to watch another minute of Premier League football until they use the adidas Telstar (the old, 32-panel, 1970 World Cup vintage one) as standard?Another quiz! The sports quiz of the week, as put together by Paul Campbell. There’s some non-football stuff in here, but don’t let that put you off.Here’s Mark McBeath with some thoughts on the proposed rule to prevent time-wasting by banning substitutions during injury-time.“Rather then tweaking rules at the margins, I’d like a trial where time-keeping isn’t the ref’s responsibility, as in some other sports.“Each time the ref whistles to stop play, an official time-keeper could stop the clock, and restart it when the ref signals to, or as a throw-in is taken or as the keeper takes a goal kick. No added time at the end, the clock simply runs to 45 minutes, the time-keeper gives a signal and the ref does the peep peep peep to end play.“One less thing for the ref to worry about and for fans to argue over.”Some light reading: a Golden Goal - Ronaldo (Brazilian) vs Compostela in 1996 by, erm, me.Roy Hodgson speaks, about Crystal Palace’s recent late defeat to Everton, and indeed a bunch of recent defeats to a bunch of teams:Here’s some more from Infantino, who told the Associated Press:I really think we have to think out of the box to think about new models to preserve football and the relevance of football and the structure of football.I don’t think there is anything that dramatic or wrong to discuss about competitions, to discuss about how to commercialise these competitions. I don’t understand this hype.You might think that Cardiff don’t have a prayer of beating Liverpool at the weekend, but at least Neil Warnock is in optimistic mood. He roared:It’s virtually impossible for any team in the current game. I think the front three is probably the best in the world. We’ve all got to play at the top of our potential to give them a good game and hope they have an off day.So then: Fifa. As mentioned, the Fifa Council is meeting in Kigali, Rwanda today, and there may be trouble ahead. Basically Gianni Infantino has a bunch of proposals for changes to the Club World Cup, and introduce a new global Nations League, based on the European one we’ve all been enjoying.Infantino wants the Club World Cup to be a bigger deal, and just bigger, with proposals floating around for it to become a four-yearly thing in place of the Confederations Cup, or an annual tournament to be held in the summer, with the number of teams increased from the current seven teams to as many as 24, including 12 from Europe. Of course this might be a high-minded concept to spread the word of football even further, or it might just be another wheeze to generate more money. About $25billion, according to the BBC, when you throw in the global Nations League thing too. Among those not keen on the plans is Infantino’s successor as Uefa top dog, Aleksander Ceferin, who feel they are being railroaded into plans that won’t suit their members. In fact, they will reportedly stage a walkout if Infantino tries to press for a vote on the proposals today. We’ll get to the big Fifa stuff shortly, but there could be an interesting tweak to the laws of football when the International Football Association Board (the people who control and change the rules and regulations) meet in March.An IFAB member told the Times:Looking at ways to cut down on time-wasting, speed up the game and increase playing time is one of our priorities. A rule to say there should be no substitutions during added-on time is an interesting one and could work well. Referees add on 30 seconds for a substitution but in practice it can eat up a lot more time than that. There would, however, need to be trials to see if there are any unforeseen ramifications.Thoughts? Would this make a difference? Would this not just lead to a stack of subs between minutes 85 and 90? Turns out Gennaro Gattuso wasn’t impressed at all with Milan’s performance in their Europa League defeat to Real Betis last night. He said, possibly while strapping on a cilice and punching himself in the face:It’s only right that my position is under discussion. It’s difficult for a coach to sleep after a performance like this, one of the worst. It was a terrible, embarrassing performance. I saw a team that was switched off and that has given me cause to reflect. I’m worried, disappointed and angry, especially with myself. This team cannot think about doing well in the championship with that sort of mentality. I can’t accept a performance like that.Quiz? Quiz! Mesut Ozil became the Premier League’s top scoring German this week, so here are some questions about some other nationalities.Spicy old report in El Pais, which if accurate doesn’t sound like Thibaut Courtois is wild about the prospect of a couple of former managers taking over at Real Madrid.Diego Torres reports - and, we should stress, this is what he says a witness told him - that Courtois said during training, with a “pale” look on his face:I can not believe it! Here I am the only one who has worked with Conte and with Mourinho. I left London to not have to go through something like that again and now it turns out that Conte comes, and if not, Mourinho. We don’t know the context. So keep that in mind. Maybe he was saying it in jest. Maybe he was deadly serious. Whatever the true picture, we know this: it’s funny. Here’s more from Mourinho:We play against Newcastle and we go to the national team period in a good situation and then after two weeks we lost Dalot in Portugal, we lost Fellaini in Belgium. We lost Alexis with Chile, we lost - who else? - McTominay with Scotland. And some of them, the national teams they were very professional with us and they send the players back and we could start the process early. But some of them, they weren’t and they kept the players and we didn’t even know the dimension and the nature of the injuries, so when the players arrived here two days before Chelsea, we have no idea what is going on.”Fuller quotes coming up. Sources have told the  that no other Premier League teams have international footballers.He also says United won’t be re-signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Have you read Eni Aluko’s column this week yet? If not, you should probably get on that. It’s about Karen Carney but more broadly social media abuse, and this passage is particularly notable.The huge problem for me is that there aren’t enough consequences for people who do this sort of thing – if they knew that writing that kind of sentence could potentially get them a jail sentence or a ban from Twitter, they wouldn’t do it. Instagram, Twitter and Facebook need to get real about the consequences and deterrents for users.Rumour Mill! The transfer window doesn’t open for another few months, but gossip never sleeps. Get stuck in. If your weekend doesn’t start here, it should start with the 10 things you need to look out for in the Premier League, by your pals Simon Burnton, Niall McVeigh and Jacob Steinberg.Plenty of big football coming up, lots of big stories, but perhaps the most extraordinary is that Andy Carroll is back in training for West Ham. Imagine that! Obviously the chances are something will snap off him before he gets near the first team, but there’s always hope.“Andy is recovering,” said Manuel Pellegrini yesterday. “He started this week working, part of the warm up with the whole squad so we will see in the next week how he improves and I hope that maximum 15 days he will at least working with the squad, completely.”Good morning, hello, and welcome to your weekend football countdown. Exciting, eh? Plenty going on today, looking forward to the on-pitch action over the next few days: we’ve got the build-up to Manchester City v Tottenham, what must be the first Messi and Ronaldo-less Barcelona v Real game in a while, whatever José Mourinho’s latest excuseexplanation for Manchester United being no good is, plus a whole bunch of other stuff that you should know before the weekend kicks off.Plus, the Fifa Council are meeting in Rwanda, and trouble is afoot. The Uefa delegates are threatening to walk out over a whole heap of issues, which we’ll get into later, but the short version is there could be an absolute s-storm brewing.So stick around, we all might learn something. Or just waste a few hours while staring intently at the clock. Maybe both. Together, we can do it.If you fancy emailing in thoughts on anything - preferably football, but let’s not restrict ourselves - then direct those to Nick.Miller.casual@the, or tweet @NickMiller79"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2f6606f630b735792be8e43752118fffa1dce7e/865_721_1693_1016/master/1693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42bba9c0f231bc7589e6ec783d05f0e3","title":"i got my head stuck in a pumpkin","story":"I felt a jab of panic as I moved my head around trying to find the right angle. ‘I can’t get it out!’ I roaredPumpkin carving at Halloween is a family tradition. When I lived in Las Vegas, we had to make do with baseball-size ones from the grocery store. But since we moved to the north-west 10 years ago, we’ve visited a local farm every October. There we ride tractors to the pumpkin patch and I compete with my three brothers and sister to seek out the biggest specimen. My dad has a rule that we have to carry our pumpkins back to the wheelbarrow, and as the eldest child I have an advantage – in 2015 I staggered back with an 85-pounder.The following year, when I was 16, it was hard to tell whether my prize or the one chosen by my 14-year-old brother, Jason, was the winner. Unfortunately we neglected to weigh them before scooping out their innards, but I was determined to prove my point. All five of us were hard at work at the kitchen table, with my mom filming the annual ritual. I’m unsure now why I thought forcing my head inside the pumpkin would settle the matter, but it seemed to make perfect sense at the time.With the pumpkin resting on the table, hole uppermost, I leaned over and pressed my crown against the opening. At first I got jammed just above my eyes and then, as I leant into my task, unwilling to quit, my nose briefly prevented entry. Then in it popped: my whole head, like a cork forced into a bottle. I was able to straighten up, triumphantly, with the gigantic squash resting on my shoulders.My exultation was short-lived. The pumpkin was heavy. “I’m going to set it down, now,” I said, and with Jason helping to support its weight, I bent back over the table to give it somewhere to rest. It was only when I tried to remove my head that I realised getting out was going to be less straightforward than getting in. The knot of my ponytail caught against the rim when I tried to pull out, as did the underside of my jaw. When I pulled my chin into my neck, my nose got in the way instead. I felt a jab of panic as I braced against the table and moved my head around trying to find the right angle, but it was no use. “I can’t get it out!” I roared, my voice sounding unnaturally loud in the enclosed space. The muffled voices from outside were oddly calming, though – Mom unruffled and amused, Jason giving advice, my 10-year-old brother, Austin, singing a song I couldn’t make out. There was enough space around my neck to let a little light in and, fortunately, I’ve always liked the smell of pumpkin. My bellowing provoked little sympathy. “Don’t use up all your oxygen,” Mom suggested.Dad was summoned – less, it seemed, in expectation of practical help than to make sure he didn’t miss out on the spectacle. I heard him propose calling the fire department. “Stay tuned,” said Mom she’d mentioned she was going to upload the video to Facebook, but it was only then I realised she’d been filming the whole time. I was stuck for five or six minutes though it felt much, much longer. The video cuts before my rescue – Dad got me to push my head farther into the pumpkin so Mom could reach in and undo the rubber band round my ponytail. I emerged with squash-conditioned hair, a sore chin and my nose plugged with pulp.That Facebook video went up the Monday before Halloween, and by the end of that day it had over 1,000 views. People asked Mom to put it on YouTube, and by Wednesday morning we were getting 5am calls from TV breakfast shows and then the international media – the video started racking up hundreds of thousands of views. When I went on a youth camp, I was recognised by children I’d never met. The pumpkin also became a minor celebrity. Passersby and trick-or-treaters would knock and ask, “Which is Rachel’s pumpkin?” before taking selfies with it.Although our pumpkin carving the following year was a more sedate affair, I wouldn’t say I learned my lesson. A few months later I squeezed myself into a laundry basket during a game of hide-and-seek and became hopelessly jammed. It was Dad who responded to my cries for help. Inevitably, I was kept waiting for a while – first he had to look for the video camera.• As told to Chris BroughtonDo you have an experience to share?

His staging, psychodramatic in approach and fiercely challenging the work’s reputation as primarily a display piece, was considered both groundbreaking and controversial when it was first seen in 2008. I had reservations about it when it was new, some of which remain. But opinion can change over time, and 10 years on it strikes me as a superbly cogent piece of theatre, subtle and disturbing in equal measure.Alden updates the work from the aftermath of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to the mid-19th century and so explores the hypocrisies and power structures of Victorian Britain that resonate down to our own times. The Ashton mansion, strikingly designed by Charles Edwards, is a stifling, decrepit hell hole where portraits of the family ancestors stare inscrutably down from the walls as Sarah Tynan’s Lucia is exploited and bartered for the sake of financial expediency. This is a world in which adherence to tradition masks brutality and abuse, and conspiracies of silence destroy lives.Lucia is sexually assaulted by her brother Enrico (Lester Lynch) in the presence of the family chaplain, Raimondo (Clive Bayley), who turns his back on them before unctuously proffering Lucia support when Enrico is out of the way. Eleazar Rodríguez’s Edgardo is a proud, impulsive hothead with a violent temper, who throws Lucia to the floor at one point when she contradicts him. Forced into marriage with Michael Colvin’s supercilious Arturo, she becomes a sacrificial victim pinioned on an altar, and madness becomes her only means of escape from the men who seek to control her life.The drawback to Alden’s approach is that he loses sight of the work’s political dimension – specifically the crucial fact that Edgardo and Enrico face each other across a ide that is as much ideological as monetary. But even so, this is a darkly compelling interpretation and the final scenes in particular are chilling. Bayley rounds on Elgan Llŷr Thomas’s Normanno, accusing him of being the tragedy’s prime mover, but it’s clear by the time the curtain falls that the moral responsibility for Lucia’s death is communal, that an entire society has her blood on its hands.Musically, it’s exceptionally strong. Tackling the title role for the first time, Tynan sings with a silvery purity of tone and an exquisite sense of line. Her coloratura is admirably liquid, yet always placed at the service of the drama. She can be thrillingly accurate in her upper registers, though in the Mad Scene she replaces the traditional showpiece cadenza with something altogether more thoughtful and darkly expressive. Rodríguez makes an outstanding Edgardo, meanwhile: handsome-sounding, impeccably stylish and intense, with an easy ring at the top of his voice.Lynch, a fine vocal actor, expertly captures Enrico’s obsessive temperament and self-loathing, while Bayley, returning to the role he sang in the first run, is oily hypocrisy incarnate. The smaller roles are cast from strength and vividly characterised. Stuart Stratford conducts with great passion and care, slowly ratcheting up the tension as the evening progresses. The choral singing is tremendous."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc1a6f3986499b7f2efa82931f8b420c9267d845/0_182_1430_858/master/1430.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aebd6bab47f317e127fe345384d2ce1d","title":"sinead oconnor converts to islam shuhada davitt","story":"The singer says she is ‘very, very, very happy’ and thanks Muslims for welcoming herThe singer formerly known as Sinéad O’Connor has converted to Islam, changing her name to Shuhada’.She made the announcement on Twitter, saying her conversion was “the natural conclusion of any intelligent theologian’s journey. All scripture study leads to Islam. Which makes all other scriptures redundant.”She has since documented her new faith, writing that she was “very, very, very happy” after being given her first hijab, and expressing thanks to “all my Muslim brothers and sisters who have been so kind as to welcome me to Ummah”, meaning the Islamic community. She also posted a YouTube video of her making the Islamic call to prayer.Her full new name is Shuhada’ Davitt, using the surname she gave herself when she changed her name to Magda Davitt in 2017. She said at the time that she wanted to be “free of the patriarchal slave names. Free of the parental curses.”Davitt has candidly documented her struggles with mental health in recent years, posting a Facebook video in August 2017 in which she admitted to suicidal thoughts. “I am one of millions ... people who suffer from mental illness are the most vulnerable people on earth, we can’t take care of ourselves, you’ve got to take care of us,” she said in the video. “My entire life is revolving around not dying, and that’s not living.” In a previous update in November 2015, she said she had “taken an overdose”, and a police search was launched for her in May 2016 after she briefly went missing in Chicago, sparking fears for her wellbeing.Earlier this week, she claimed on Twitter that a healthcare assistant working with her was fired “for spiking me with crystal meth”.She was ordained as a priest in 1999 by the Irish Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic church – the group are not officially affiliated with the Catholic church, who do not allow the ordination of women as priests.She became disillusioned with Catholicism in the wake of child abuse scandals in the church, describing the Vatican as a “nest of devils” in a 2011 newspaper article. In an open letter published in August this year, she asked Pope Francis to excommunicate her, and said she had made similar previous appeals to Pope Benedict and John Paul II.Also in August, she released her first new music in four years, a song called Milestones made with Northern Irish producer David Holmes, whom she met at a birthday party for Pogues frontman Shane MacGowan. She is preparing a new album called No Mud No Lotus, which, she says, won’t be out before October 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c0d607d1e57ab1725871fc3daedf0e3eac24a65/0_0_3443_2903/master/3443.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d543a33224e4853329599f93a653ff12 1010w","title":"politics live readers edition 26 october","story":"A forum where readers can discuss today’s politics and share links to breaking news and to the most interesting politics stories, blogs and tweets on the webWe’re not writing our usual blog today but here, as an alternative, is the Politics Live readers’ edition.

As a result, Hubble has remained in so-called safe mode and all science observations are on hold.Gyroscopes are needed to keep Hubble pointing in the right direction as it operates 340 miles (545km) above Earth. Precise pointing is crucial: astronomers use the telescope to peer deep into the cosmos, revealing faraway galaxies, black holes and solar systems. Last week, astronomers said they may have discovered the first moon outside our solar system, with Hubble’s help.The problem with the backup gyroscope was spotted when detectors in the gyroscope wrongly signalled that the wheel within the device was rotating at a much greater rate than that 19,200 revolutions per minute it should be spinning at.Nasa has said Hubble is expected to  return to normal science operations soon after it performed a “running restart” of the gyroscope on 16 October, which turned the device off for a second. The intention was to clear any faults that may have occurred during a restart on 6 October. That did not seem to work so it was followed up on 18 October with a series of spacecraft manoeuvres – known as turns – in an attempt to clear any blockage around the sealed “float” which contains the spinning wheel in the gyroscope. At the same time the system was switched between two modes to help with the procedure. The team think that the dodgy rotation speeds could have arisen if the float was off centre in the device.“At a high level, if people want to call it jiggling around, I suppose they can,” Patrick Crouse, Hubble’s operations project manager, told the Washington Post. “But we were trying to do very particular activities we thought would clear the problem. It certainly wasn’t as simple as turning it off and turning it back on.”The next day further jiggling of the telescope and twiddling of switches was performed: the issue now appears to be resolved.The space agency said: “The Hubble operations team plans to execute a series of tests to evaluate the performance of the gyro under conditions similar to those encountered during routine science observations, including moving to targets, locking on to a target, and performing precision pointing.

So that is one of our exciting sites.“But there really is going to be something for everybody, because we do cover the entire range of history.”A battlefield site presents particular challenges, she said. “They are really ephemeral in the landscape, because people just met there for a day, moved across, had combat and went away.” Archaeologists will use metal detectors to hunt for arrowheads and weaponry, while there is a slim chance of burials on the edges of the battlefield.“But you’re just trying to look for something that can validate the written sources that we have, that are obviously hundreds of years old. If we find arrowheads of the day, or weaponry of the day, or pieces of armoury, that helps us really pin down what people were writing about. Because obviously history was generally written by the victors, so they might have a particular spin on the battle. So are they telling the truth?”In Birmingham, excavations include exploration of the 19th century Park Street burial ground on what will be the site of the new HS2 Curzon Street station, which the archaeologists say will offer an insight into a period when the city’s population grew tenfold in the Industrial Revolution.At the other end of the line, another burial ground at St James’s gardens, next to Euston station, is expected to be the largest archaeological excavation of human remains from 18th and 19th century Britain.The cemetery, where up to 61,000 people were buried between 1788 and 1853, was the final resting place of both paupers and nobility, including a number of notable names including Captain Matthew Flinders, who completed the first circumnavigation of Australia, and Bill ‘The Terror’ Richmond, a freed slave who was born in New York but came to London and became a famous bare-knuckle boxer who taught Lord Byron to spar.Wass said the project would seek to engage people living along the length of the rail line, offering community events, pop-up museums, apprenticeships and training opportunities at different sites.“We are really trying to engage communities, because I think everybody is very interested in their locality, even if they haven’t been particularly aware, for example, of the Roman site down the road. I think people always want to know who these people were, where they lived, how they lived, how they cooked their food – all those stories that bring our ancestors to life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/943af9ea26e4f7b4c6c109213453eba346301b34/130_0_3340_2004/master/3340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4a0b8dbb404ffa99c2b705185ed838a","title":"astronomy photographer of the year 2018 the winning images","story":"The US photographer Brad Goldpaint has beaten thousands of amateur and professional photographers from around the globe to win the Royal Observatory Greenwich’s title of Insight Investment Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2018.

Ministers must “take decisive action, not more warm words,” he said.He said the government should offer “housing delivery contracts”, where developers sign up to targets for the rate of housebuilding on a site, with fines if these targets are missed.Healey said that would provide much greater power over the speed at which homes are built. Councils only have the power to give or refuse permission to build.Earlier this year, Labour proposed the creation of a new English Sovereign Land Trust, to buy discounted land and allocate it to a range of developers, breaking up the number of big firms on larger sites.Landowners sell at a price that factors in a significant increase in value after obtaining planning consent, meaning a hectare of agricultural land worth £20,000 can sell for closer to £2m if it is zoned for housing. Developers regularly deny using land to speculate, arguing more profit can usually be made from building.Labour is considering a policy to give the Land Trust powers to buy sites at closer to the lower price, by changing the 1961 Land Compensation Act so the state could compulsorily purchase land at a price that excluded the potential for future planning consent.“The chancellor must use the budget to break big developers’ stranglehold over new homes and speed up housebuilding,” Healey said, saying housing was still below pre-crisis levels despite a number of government initiatives.“This means giving councils the power to set tough new rules to ensure homes get built quickly. The number of new social rented homes is stuck at the lowest level since the second world war. We need decisive action, not more warm words from ministers.”Greg Beales, the Shelter housing charity’s director of policy and campaigns, said the UK could not afford to fall behind. “We have become overly reliant on big developers who will only build as fast as they can sell, but many people simply can’t afford the homes they have to offer,” he said. “This has created a massive logjam, which can only be unblocked if we bring down the cost of land and start building the social homes which people actually need.”The former cabinet minister Oliver Letwin is chairing an independent review of land banking, which Shelter said it hoped would recommend strong legislative changes to the Land Compensation Act to bring down the cost of land. It is expected to report back next week.Housing minister Kit Malthouse said: “There is no mission more urgent than making our housing market work, and we are committed to building 300,000 homes a year by the mid 2020s.“Building more of the homes people want on large sites more quickly is an important part of this. We asked Sir Oliver Letwin to carry out an independent review into the build out rate so we can get more properties built more quickly and he will report back shortly. This is all part of our drive to build more, better, faster.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1583e3eb515c27c49ead4d41d799ee651298c36/0_77_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c37c2963b0b0166e89a534aec37cd2d","title":"universal credit not solely to blame food bank rise minister says","story":"Alok Sharma insists jobcentre staff and claimants are happy with benefits overhaulUniversal credit cannot be solely blamed for the rise in food bank use in areas where the benefit is being rolled out, the minister for employment has said.Alok Sharma was responding to a report from a committee of MPs that found the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had a “fortress mentality” that prevented it from tackling the “unacceptable hardship” created by the switch to universal credit.With the chancellor under intense pressure to act in his budget next Monday to cushion the impact of the new system, the public accounts committee said the government had ignored the concerns of those affected.Universal credit is the most radical change to Britain’s welfare system in decades, rolling six benefits into one, which is paid in arrears to mimic a monthly wage packet.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Sharma insisted the message he was getting from jobcentre staff and claimants was that they were much happier with universal credit.Asked about it three times, Sharma said another report by MPs had suggested there were “very many reasons” why people used food banks and they could not be attributed to just one factor.Sharma rejected claims that his boss, Esther McVey, had been ducking out of media appearances, and said he was responsible for the government’s benefits policy, which he claimed was working because “cliff edges” that had previously put people off working had been removed.He said he had been visiting jobcentres, most recently in  Harlow, Essex, adding: “There are absolutely brilliant people in DWP working as work coaches and they tell me that for the first time in their lives they are doing what they came in to do, which is to provide that one-to-one support which wasn’t available under the legacy system, and that’s a message I get from claimants when I talk to them.”Separately, analysis by the campaign group 38 Degrees claimed that as many as 39 Conservative MPs, including Sharma, could lose their seats as four million people have their income reduced because of the benefit changes.The group highlighted the constituencies where the number of people who could be moved on to UC was significantly higher than the majority held by the incumbent MP. In 39 seats it was at least double the majority in 23 of those seats, it was five times higher.Those said to be at risk included one of the key architects of UC, the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, whose majority of 2,438 was significantly outweighed by the 6,180 households expected to be moved on to UC. Sharma is defending a majority of 2,876 in a constituency where 6,567 households were expected to feel the impact of the shake-up.The chair of the public accounts committee took evidence from charities and local authorities, which told MPs they had seen sharp increases in rent arrears and food bank usage among new recipients of universal credit, not least because of the five-week wait for the first payment.But the committee said McVey’s department had repeatedly been unresponsive to on-the-ground evidence about the practical problems with universal credit, and what it called the “unacceptable hardship” faced by many."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03e1ddc820ceb04de953575dd3a55baf0b272c3e/74_249_1866_1119/master/1866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91fc17d89e66ca9b532b1a1f1d96080f","title":"ben stokes looks future world cup ashes england cricket team sri lanka","story":"Ben Stokes hopes his future England performances will become what he is eventually remembered for as he looks to put the events of last year’s much-publicised street fight firmly in the rear-view mirror.After being found not guilty of affray at Bristol crown court during the summer, the England all-rounder has one last hurdle to overcome as both he and teammate Alex Hales go before a cricket disciplinary hearing in early December.But speaking at the England team hotel in Colombo before Saturday’s one-off Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, Stokes insisted his mind is now solely on delivering for his country and not on any sporting sanctions that may result.Asked about missing last winter’s Ashes, Stokes replied: “That’s the thing about going forward. Everything you do from here onwards is what people will hopefully remember. That’s what I’m trying to do. As I said, it’s a big year coming up, two important things – a World Cup and an Ashes – and with them both being in England it’s really exciting.”Despite the not guilty verdict in August, the England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, said the fallout from events in Bristol on 25 September had likely serve as a “wake-up call” for Stokes and added that a show of public contrition may be advisable at some stage.With the Cricket Discipline Commission’s verdict yet to be determined – he and Hales are due in front of the panel on 5 and 7 December – Stokes is keeping his counsel for now and there has been the suggestion that this is to avoiding prejudicing the process.Instead he intends to let his cricket do the talking and despite a rain-affected one-day series against Sri Lanka, there are signs his best form is returning. Both an unbeaten 35 in the shortened third match, and his 67 from 60 balls in the fifth, saw him far more fluent at the crease and the England management are encouraged.In the summer’s Test 3-1 series victory against India Stokes throttled back with the bat, scoring at a strike-rate of 41 due to the seaming conditions. The 27-year-old believes this adaptability will serve him well down the line, not least looking ahead to the Tests with Sri Lanka that start on 6 November in Galle.“It’s just playing to the situation.

LeBron James changes the balance of power in the NBA every time he moves teams. Serena Williams has forced tennis to confront issues of racism and sexism. Neymar’s contract demands may soon affect global GDP rankings.We should now include a 4ft 8in 21-year-old on that list. Through a perfect storm of circumstances – a strong claim to be the greatest ever in her sport and a series of misadventures in her national federation – she wields incomparable influence. She’s Simone Biles, and she is changing gymnastics in innumerable ways.When the American competes at the World Gymnastics Championships in Doha this week, few of her competitors will have any hope of challenging her. On the mat and various apparatuses, she is beyond comparison. She literally rewrote gymnastics’ history at the age of 16, when she added a new, fiendishly difficult leaping tumble to the sport’s code of points in the same year she won the first of her three successive World Championship all-round titles. She was one of the stars – in any sport – of the 2016 Rio Olympics, winning four gold medals. She took a break in 2017, but has returned to competition this year and is as dominant as ever.It’s away from the gyms and arena that she’s truly flexing her muscles. She has spoken about her difficult childhood – she entered foster care at the age of three before she was eventually adopted by her maternal grandparents – and has worked with organisations that help children in similar situations.But it was this month, when USA Gymnastics appointed a new interim presidentCEO, that Biles’s influence became clear. Mary Bono, a former gymnast and Republican congresswoman, was appointed to the position on 12 October. She didn’t last long. The next day, gymnastics fans found a tweet of Bono drawing over a Nike swoosh in response to the company’s campaign featuring quarterback-turned-activist Colin Kaepernick. Biles offered a short but pointed response on Twitter: “Don’t worry, it’s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,” she wrote.Bono promptly deleted her original tweet, but a headline in Deadspin summed up the situation in US gymnastics: “Simone Biles Has All The Power, And She Knows It.” Fellow Olympic champion Aly Raisman then followed up Biles’s lead. She attacked Bono for her ties to a consulting firm she accused of failing to act on the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal while it worked with USA Gymnastics. On 16 October, Bono resigned. Under fire from Biles and Raisman, her reign hadn’t even lasted a week.Even before the Bono incident Biles had emerged as a fearsome force for change within USA Gymnastics in the wake of the Nassar sexual-abuse scandal, which shook the sport to its core. Biles wasn’t the first athlete to say she was a survivor of Nassar, the longtime USA Gymnastics team doctor who pled guilty to sexual-abuse charges and is now serving an effective life sentence for his crimes. That would be Rachel Denhollander, who broke the long-standing silence on Nassar and eventually opened the floodgates for a wave of survivors to tell their stories, many of them Olympic medalists.Raisman has taken the most direct approach to confronting not just Nassar but those who failed to stop him. In a blistering testimony at Nassar’s sentencing hearing in January, Raisman calmly and firmly ripped into the disgraced doctor before she turned her attention to USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee for their failure to stop the abuse. In March, she sued both organizations along with Nassar and two former USA Gymnastics officials – president Steve Penny and board chairman Paul Parilla. (Penny was arrested this month, accused of tampering with evidence in the Nassar investigation.)While Biles did not appear at Nassar’s hearing to tell her story of abuse under his care, she has made a powerful impact, using her position as the sport’s biggest star to change gymnastics, often with an economy of words.In August, two days before the US Championships, Biles responded to a question about the overhauled management of USA Gymnastics – including Kerry Perry, who had been named presidentCEO in November 2017 and had been criticised for her inaction over the Nassar scandal. With a succinct but withering statement Biles said: “Hopefully, it’s going in the right direction but nobody can know until Kerry Perry speaks up. It’s kind of hard.” Biles was then asked if Perry should step up and speak more. “Yes,” Biles said. “It’s her job.” Less than a month later Perry resigned.Biles’s comments certainly weren’t the only factor in Perry’s exit. Raisman and Denhollander spoke up again when USA Gymnastics hired Mary Lee Tracy, a coach who complimented Nassar shortly after his indictment in 2016, as elite development coordinator. Each called the appointment “a slap in the face.” But throughout this time, Biles was finding her voice. While sweeping the gold medals at the US Championships in August, she wore a teal leotard, intentionally selecting a color that has emerged as a symbol of strength for sexual-abuse survivors.Biles’s implicit support of Kaepernick during Bono’s attack on the quarterback is interesting. Although the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback’s activism has attracted far more attention than Biles’s own foray into social issues, her impact has arguably been more concrete. Kaepernick deserves immense credit for influencing the national conversation on race and freedom of expression in America, but the NFL has dug in its heels on national anthem protests and he is still without a team. Biles, in contrast, has helped remove two CEOs from her sport’s governing body, advocated for abuse survivors and arrives in Doha as the finest gymnast in the world.She clearly isn’t going away either: she has spoken of her desire to compete at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. It’s a safe bet she won’t be silent – or powerless – in the run-up to the Games, and perhaps for years to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cdf227101b332f1949d41927385142436a05629/0_140_3200_1919/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3f7e1b6ab344a26bb1c6919988978da","title":"sports quiz week clasico harvard fa cup tennis","story":"Who scored?

Sloane Stephens revealing a love of Lionel, bingo and embalming. Yup. Not wanting to be a doom-monger (but I am going to be) surrounding Kerber’s chances but along with her dismal 1-4 record against Stephens, she also suffered a lower back injury in beating Naomi Osaka on Wednesday...If you’re twiddling your thumbs waiting for the match to start, then why not put them to good use with our Sports Quiz of the Week (a mediocre 710 over here)...Elsewhere, reviews could be expanded to include double-bounces and net touches with the ATP trialling the new system at the Next-Gen Finals in Milan from November 6-10. This, from Phil Casey of the Press Association...A new form of video review will be tested at next month’s ATP Next Gen Finals, allowing players to challenge a wider range of decisions. Using the same Hawk-Eye technology which is used on disputed line calls, the experiment will cover double-bounces, net touches or shots played before the ball has crossed the net. In such situations players will be able to call for a review, with no limits on the number of requests, with a video operator then sending the relevant footage to the chair umpire’s table. As with line calls, the same images will appear on the big screen in the venue. Gayle David Bradshaw, executive vice president, ATP rules and competition, said: “Controversy with these types of decisions are rare, but when they do occur they can be particularly unsettling for players. “We do not expect a lot of challenges, but should any instances arise, this technology will ensure the correct decision is reached.” Future use of video review could also include decisions on whether to award the point or to replay it in the case of a corrected line call by an official. In other, considerably more serious, injury news Caroline Wozniacki revealed yesterday that she’s been diagonsed with rheumatoid arthritis...Speaking in her post-match presser, Bertens, who led 6-3, said...I saw her in the match before that she was struggling a little bit with the hamstring, and of course she was taped today, but I think in the beginning she was still okay. It’s never easy or never nice to win a match like this, but it is what it is. I’ll take it and I’ll take my rest, and I have some more recovery time for tomorrow.Regarding Naomi Osaka’s injury, it seems it was her left hamstring. Although that’s unconfirmed.Hello... Noted Lionel Richie fanatic Sloane Stephens takes on Angelique Kerber in the final round robin match at the Finals and, joy of joys, for you, me and the good people of the WTA, there’s plenty at stake! Naomi Osaka’s fantastic season came to a rather sad end earlier today when she had to retire hurt from her match against Kiki Bertens, which has put the latter into the semi-finals – the first Dutchwoman since Brenda Schultz-McCarthy in 1995 to do so, which is nice. Aaaaanyway, as a result, both Stephens and Kerber need to win to follow Bertens into the last four, with Elina Svitolina and Karolína Plíšková having qualified yesterday. Stephens has been impressive, beating Bertens and Osaka – albeit needing three sets in both – and victory over Kerber would ensure she tops the Red Group. Should the German, who defeated Osaka but lost to Bertens, triumph she would advance as runner-up with Stephens eliminated.In terms of head-to-head records, history would lean heavily towards a Stephens win given she’s beaten Kerber in four of their five encounters with the only loss coming at Indian Wells in 2012 when she was just 19 and beginning to make her breakthrough on Tour. In those four straight victories, the American is also yet to drop a set and Kerber’s resistance has amounted to only 16 games.

The place to start is the immense, teeming Djemaa el-Fna square, which every evening sees up to 100 food stalls set up with their makeshift kitchens, tables and chairs and serving counters groaning with a cornucopia of Moroccan dishes. Waiters can be pushy, prices seem a steal until the bill comes as the total mounts with additions you don’t recall ordering: olives, bread, tomato salad, mint tea. Most visitors will experience a meal there once, but there are many other places waiting to be discovered in the souks of the medina and beyond.It takes no time to escape the crowds and noise of Djemaa el-Fna and then follow the huge blue sign in the metalworkers’ souk to the Zen oasis of this cafe. Behind the tiny door lies a health food diner that incorporates a gift shop, art gallery, roof terraces and a school for henna art where visitors can observe the artists and get a pattern painted on their hand. Run by a local Berber, Rachid Karkouch, and American artist, Lori Gordon, a traveller who ended up staying after a holiday, the cafe opened two years ago. Daily vegetarian and vegan specials include the likes of hummus soup and caramelised pumpkin, while meat-eaters can try the chicken gumbo or grilled turkey brochettes. They also supply fun straw sun hats when it gets too hot on the terrace.• Mains from £2.50, Riad Zeitoun al Kdim, marrakechhennaartcafeWatching the dyers work in the Souk des Teinturiers is one of the highlights of the medina, and the nearby Souk Talaa has an equally colourful selection of street-food stalls. One of the most popular is overseen by the smiling, bearded cook known to everyone as Monsieur Fromage. Just ask for him by name and the other stallholders should point you in the right direction. As with all great street-food locales there are just a couple of specialities at this miniscule eatery run by a family now in its third generation. Monsieur Fromage starts grilling bunches of five skewers of lamb kidneys at 10am, changing at midday to lamb chops. Both are served with hot flatbread and tea. Nothing more, nothing less, and by 2pm the stall has sold out and shuts up for the day.• Portion of kidneys or chops £2, Souk TalaaAround the corner from Monsieur Fromage, the tiny grill at Chez Hassan offers a host of different dishes: start of with a bowl of harira, Morocco’s famous tomato, chickpea, lemon and lentil soup, chunky skewers of turkey, fish and chicken sizzle on the charcoal embers, and rather than ordering tagine or couscous, try the speciality rate au viande hachee, lamb spleen stuffed with liver. Sounds scary but then so does haggis, and it tastes delicious. Although there are only a couple of tables inside, a narrow, winding staircase leads to a first-floor dining room and then up to a shady roof terrace.• Main dishes from £2.30, Souk TalaaIn the heart of the medina, by the Marrakech Museum and a fruit and vegetable market, Bakchich is an institution that is popular with both locals and tourists. You can’t miss the cook with his bright red fez tending the tagines on a makeshift pavement cooker. With just a couple of tables at the back, this looks like a hole-in-the-wall diner, but as with so many medina locales you just have to start climbing stairs to reach a tiny rooftop terrace with drop-dead-gorgeous views. Stick to the speciality tagines: there are more than a dozen on the menu, from the speciality rabbit, meatball or fish to vegetarian with figs, apricots and almonds.• Tagines from £1.50, Talaa 294, Ben Youssef, terrasse-bakchich.business.siteJust look for the crowds at lunchtime in Souk Ablouh, where half a dozen packed-out stalls form what is know as Méchoui Alley. This place is not for the squeamish but the reward is a plate of the most delicious méchoui (smoke-roasted lamb) you will ever taste. Chez Lamine has been here for more than a century and work begins each morning by lighting the wood in the underground oven. The fire is eventually extinguished and some 40 lamb carcasses are lowered to cook in the embers and smoke. One by one, they are hauled up at lunchtime, carved by the master butcher and served by weight on a piece of paper, eaten by hand with hunks of hot flatbread accompanied by a glass of scalding hot mint tea. Unforgettable.• Mechoui £13 per kilo, a normal serving is around £3pp, Souk Ablouh 18At the edge of the busy roundabout, by the renovated Mellah spice market in Marrakech’s old Jewish quarter, the rickety plastic tables and chairs of this thriving stall spread out across the pavement, while across the road, the faithful head into prayers at Sidi Hamed el Kamel mosque. This is Berber cooking at its best a dozen tagines cooking away, with the cook keeping them moist by pouring water from a kettle every so often as if he were watering his plants. Pungent sardines and kofte skewers grill on burning charcoal and pots of beans and lentils bubble away. The Marrakech speciality is tangia, chicken or lamb slow-cooked for hours in an earthenware pot with saffron, garlic and preserved lemon, eaten with just a traditional flatbread rather than rice or potatoes.• Chicken tangia £2, Riad Zeitoun al Kdim 2Off the beaten track in the quiet Bab Taghzout neighbourhood, this charming Italian eatery is a real find, popular with locals and expats looking for cucina all’italiana alongside a modern, light interpretation of Moroccan cuisine, plus a good choice of vegetarian dishes. Adriano Pirani, an architect from Bologna, chose to renovate this beautiful riad as a restaurant rather than hotel, and the tiled courtyard of fountains, mosaics and lemon trees is perfect for a romantic alfresco dinner. Chef Valerio Arciona has clearly been influenced by local flavours, so try his tangy carrot veloute with ginger, powdered almonds and lemon zest, a classic seafood spaghetti using plump local clams or, for the brave, a juicy camel burger with orange-spiced onions.• Mains £7.50, Dyour Saboun 40, Bab Taghzout, +212 05243 83030You can’t miss Earth Cafe’s giant signpost in the noisy metalworkers’ souk pointing veggie enthusiasts down an alley to its funky psychedelic diner.

No polling has been conducted on the hopefuls, but the favorite appears to be Bill Bayes, who ran as vice-president in 2016.“I think there’s a good chance that I will win,” a bullish Bayes told the .“I put out my interest in doing it right after the 2016 election.”The tight nomination race follows what was a largely theoretical run in 2016 that saw the selection of a Pennsylvania-based former US marine band member, Jim Hedges. The Prohibition party is the oldest third party in the US, but like other small parties it faces difficulties getting on the ballot in many states.Despite voters only being able to vote Prohibition in three states in 2016, Hedges pulled in the party’s best total since 1988 – but those 5,000-plus votes were a far cry from the Prohibition party’s heyday.Its best performance came in 1892, when 270,000 people voted for John Bidwell, a gold prospector, farmer and former soldier. In the 19th century the Prohibition party was progressive on at least some issues – as early as 1872 it supported women getting the vote, something which was only introduced nationally in 1920.But the party’s current platform is distinctly rightwing. The Prohibitionists are anti-abortion – the platform describes abortion as “morally repugnant” – and considers same-sex marriage “an abomination to God”. Those evangelical-esque beliefs are tied in with Trumpian views on trade tariffs and an “America First” message, alongside, of course, the curbing of alcohol use.The Prohibition party got its wish of preventing the sale and production of alcohol in 1919, but prohibition was repealed in 1933, and there seems little hope of it returning. In 2016 neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump adopted the banning of alcohol as part of their platform, though Trump is famously teetotal.Hedges’ performance has galvanized the party, however.“We really were excited,” Bayes, who lives in Mississippi, said of the 2016 result.“We were real pleased with that. We were surprised.”Hedges’ performance represented a vast improvement on 2012, when the Prohibition nominee, Jack Fellure, garnered just 518 votes, partly due to only being on the ballot in one state, partly due to his lack of tech-savvy making it difficult to coordinate a more successful campaign.“He didn’t have a cellphone, he didn’t have a computer,” said Rick Knox, the chairman of the Prohibition party.That year, bad weather thwarted the party’s bid to make the ballot in Arkansas – the application was delayed because of rain – while the Prohibition party was unable to register for the ballot in New Jersey after losing track of two party members when they moved house.In 2020, though, Knox is determined that the party will come roaring back. He is in charge of ballot access this time, and will use his experience from working on Pat Buchanan’s bid for the Republican presidential nomination in the 1990s.Knox hopes to get the Prohibition party on the ballot in seven states – including Wisconsin and Ohio, which were key to Trump’s victory in 2016. Some states in the US require a substantial fee to get a candidate on the ballot, while others require thousands of signatures – a process which requires organization, and more funding.Given those obstacles, it is difficult for any third party to make a breakthrough in the presidential race, let alone one with the Prohibition party’s tiny budget. Because of that, Knox is realistic about his party’s chances.“When you’re not a major party you operate at a disadvantage,” Knox said.“When you’re trying to run a presidential campaign with under six figures in the bank you’re not gonna fare too well.”Knox said he hopes to win 25,000 to 30,000 votes, which would be the biggest tally since 1960, but is likely to be far less than the number of people who vote for Trump or his Democratic opponent.For now, at least, the Democratic party, the Republican party, and any sort of party involving alcohol are safe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places. Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world.

Joyous, of course, unless you are parent of small children, own pets, are working a night-shift over the weekend, or don’t like the trade off of earlier sunsets for a bit more morning light.2018 may mark one of the final times that the continent of Europe changes the clocks back in unison with the UK – or indeed at all, as moves are afoot to abolish daylight saving time in the EU.Since 2002, EU Directive 200084EC has regulated the time change between winter and summer time in the EU, stating that the last weekend in March and the last weekend in October should be the switchover dates. But a 2017 report by the European parliament into the practice has led to the European parliament voting that daylight savings time arrangement be reconsidered, allowing member states to opt out of changing their clocks. Some non-EU European countries, like Russia, Turkey, Belarus and Iceland, have already abandoned the practice.The argument in favour of the harmonising the clock change across the EU is that it helps the single market to function, and is beneficial to the transport sector, especially cross-border, while also making some energy savings.But scientists and politicians have become increasingly worried on the impact it has on the human sleep cycle. In 2016 an investigation by the German Bundestag concluded that “the process of adaptation to the time change might be more difficult for some people than has been assumed in earlier years”.Researchers had previously thought that the clock change, particularly in spring, caused people to suffer minor jet-lag style symptoms for a couple of days after the change. They now think, according to the Bundestag report, that the effects can last up to four weeks, and that “for some people the process of adaptation itself takes place only insufficiently or not at all”.While not the highest consideration in Brexit talks over the Irish border, it raises the possibility that in the future Dublin could have to choose between abolishing daylight savings time and creating a time-zone border with Northern Ireland, or retaining it and being out of step with the time zones of some fellow EU states.Changing the clocks seems set to stay in the UK. It is just over 100 years since the concept of changing the clocks was introduced by the 1916 Summer Time Act, and there doesn’t appear to be any great groundswell of opinion among British politicians about changing domestic arrangements for British summer time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45606cde8b69492d229fa5b28de2edcb398cab82/0_183_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a7dd8fa43a6cd90dd4b9b6c556b2e63","title":"apec summit papua new guinea maserati thousands strike","story":"Bus drivers and airport staff stay home to protest against government purchase of luxury cars Thousands of people have participated in a one-day strike in Papua New Guinea to protest against the purchase of a fleet of Maseratis by the government for next month’s Apec conference.The protest was organised after it was revealed earlier this month that the government of the country in the south-west Pacific Ocean bought 40 luxury cars, and later three Bentleys, to ferry around dignities during the multilateral Apec leaders meeting in the capital Port Moresby.Angry at the lavish spend, opposition MPs announced a national day of protest for Friday, calling for Papua New Guineans to boycott work for the day and stay home. Strikers reportedly included transport drivers and airport staff.Bryan Kramer, MP for Madang, said the boycott was successful and there was “very little traffic on the road” during Port Moresby’s peak hour on Friday morning.“For those who turned up to work only to find that many of your colleagues stayed home I would encourage you to ask your employer for half day off there is no point working when half the workforce stayed home,” he said.Martyn Namorong, a well known PNG commentator and one of the protest organisers, said it “felt like Sunday” in Port Moresby.In the north of the country, bus drivers refused to go to work in Wewak, and in Lae – PNG’s second largest city – many people avoided work and went to the city’s agriculture show.The boycott was supported by some unions, including the PNG Banks and Financial Institutions Workers Union.“Taxpayers are… key stakeholders hence have a indisputable right to know how their contributions into the economy in terms of direct tax is being spent by the government,” said union president Killie Sapu.However, president of the PNG Trade Union Congress distanced his organisation - the largest union in the country - from the boycott. John Paska said wages, housing, health and education were more pressing issues to protest than the Maseratis, and Apec was too important to risk it being “derailed”.Namorong said it was not a protest against the summit.“It’s a protest against the corruption associated with the hosting of Apec. It’s not a protest against world leaders, it’s a protest against our own corrupt, unaccountable politicians,” he said.Namorong said the fact the Maserati purchases were only revealed in a news report highlight the lack of transparency around government spending. “I think the people in the provinces are much angrier than people in Port Moresby,” he said.As well as hosting Apec, the PNG government is also dealing with a devastating earthquake recovery, a nationwide medication shortage, a polio outbreak and worsening TB rates in addition to generally high rates of poverty.Spending on Apec was already a lightning rod for anger among Papua New Guineans. After paying government debt and government wages, there is often very little left over for health, education and other services for the citizens of the country.Police commissioner Gary Baki said people were free to stay home, but police would not tolerate protests or marches. He urged bus and taxi drivers to consider “what could possibly happen to their daily earnings should they choose not to operate”.Chief Secretary Isaac Lupari said public servants must report to work.“I do not want to see any public servants involved in this in any way, as this would be in breach of the Public Service Act and their employment conditions,” Lupari said.“This nonsense is not a strike about an industrial issue, but a soapbox for self-serving politicians.”Minister for Apec, Justin Tkatchenko, has repeatedly claimed all the luxury cars would all be bought – at price – by the “private sector” but he hasn’t provided any confirmation of any purchase commitments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0748ac7875a6168ca31d0de6f58f406a8bd48aae/8_0_3726_2236/master/3726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df3a70120d53f8897b026968be8b9bee","title":"party island of boracay reopens minus drinking smoking and raw sewage","story":"Philippines tourism hotspot limits visitor numbers and clears out casinos and beach vendorsThe Philippines has reopened its famous holiday island of Boracay – spruced up and newly regulated after it was closed to mend decades of harm caused by unchecked tourism.The sandy idyll was closed to visitors in April after President Rodrigo Duterte called it a “cesspool” tainted by raw sewage flowing from hotels and restaurants straight into the sea.But the rechristened resort has a slew of new rules that restrict drinking on the beach, limit the number of tourists and hotels, all while renovations continue.Under the new regime, the beachfront has been cleared of the masseuses, vendors, bonfires and even the builders of its famous photo-op sandcastles. Buildings have been bulldozed and businesses pushed back to create a 30-metre buffer zone from the waterline.All water sports, including scuba ing, jet skiing and kit-boarding, have also been banned for the time being while a marine assessment is carried out by ers and marine biologists this week.Boracay’s three casinos have also been permanently closed, in line with Duterte’s wishes.Years of overdevelopment on the tiny island – which previously handled 2 million tourists a year – had left it soiled, crowded and pushed to its limits.Cabinet and local government officials unveiled a billboard-size image of Boracay’s Puka Beach on Friday, before declaring the island “officially open to all”.\u0026nbspMichael A Martillano, the president of the island’s ing association, who is taking part in the marine assessment of Boracay this week, told the  the water quality, corals and marine life had “really improved” in the past six months.But he admitted that some of the new restrictions, particularly on parties, would be a “big adjustment for all of us”.Drinking and smoking are banned on the beach and the huge multi-day beach parties dubbed “LaBoracay” that drew tens of thousands of tourists during the 1 May labour day weekend will be a thing of the past.“Boracay has been known as one of the best destinations for a laidback island where you could party any time you want, often on the beach, but now that won’t happen in the same way,” said Martillano. “It’s still going to be fun but the old habits of doing whatever you want, whenever you want to party, that will be the biggest change and probably tough for some people.”The fact that ing and water sports remained suspended was “ a bit of a bummer for us, very frustrating”, said Martillano, but overall he was optimistic about the future of Boracay.“It’s now going to be a different mentality for everyone who will enter Boracay, whether you are a tourist, or a local or a worker on the island,” he said. “Have a good time but also take care of mother nature.”Boracay, which major tourist magazines consistently rate as among the world’s best beaches, measures a mere 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres).At peak times there would be 40,000 visitors there, spending $1bn a year but also leaving mountains of garbage and an overflowing sewer system.The new rules say 19,200 tourists will be allowed on the island at any one time, with the government aiming to enforce that by controlling the number of available hotel rooms.Nearly 400 hotels and restaurants deemed to violate local environmental laws have already been ordered closed and airlines as well as ferries have been told to restrict services.Thirty-year-old tourist Roan Tadle from Manila said: “Even if there are many renovations and it’s not yet perfect, when you go to the beach you realise that closing it for six months was worth it.”Tourism secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat says she hopes the new Boracay will be the start of a “culture of sustainable tourism” in the Philippines, adding other tourist destinations will be next.The Boracay Foundation, the main business industry group on the island, has not commented on the restrictions but welcomed the return of tourists.Tens of thousands of workers were left unemployed when the island’s tourism machine was deprived of visitors.“Life will go back to normal. We will have money and work again,” said Jorge Flores, 45, a hotel worker. “In the past six months, hotels here were like … a ghost town.”Other places in the region strained by mass tourism have also used closures as a tactic to protect the sites from destruction.Thai authorities announced in October that the glittering bay immortalised in the movie The Beach will be closed indefinitely to allow it to recover from the impact of tourism."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Civilian John Barrett has clashed with senior officers since joining Garda in 2014Man in hospital with gunshot wound to arm after incident in Meakstown on ThursdayMet \u0026Eacuteireann say temperatures will drop below zero on Friday nightAirline claims cabin crew did not witness racist abuse during altercationVoters will decide on the next President and the offence of blasphemy in the ConstitutionOur Lady\u0026rsquos Hospital in Crumlin not following national guidelines for dealing with CPE bugFront Line Defenders dedicates award to human rights workers worldwideEU commissioner says remains optimistic about Brexit deal40,000 jazz fans to attend as New Orleans-style funeral procession hits townFormer minister said politicians use the shelter of parliament to defame public servantsIt is often thought the state is the strong party in criminal law and the defendant weaker, but with major corporations the roles can be reversedC\u0026ampAG notes just 246 of 547 housing bodies have signed up for regulatory systemThe newly refurbished facility will not house the 22 inmates \u0026lsquowho should not be in prison\u0026rsquoD\u0026uacuten Laoghaire-Rathdown questions plan to have passengers change buses to get to city centreTransport authority said it did not have the resources to attend local information meetings throughout the summerDermot Ahern says 2009 law was designed to make prosecutions for the act impossibleGovernment officials are working on \u0026lsquoplan B\u0026rsquo amid fears over possible collapse of processMore than 5,000 neurosurgical procedures carried out at Temple Street over past decade"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3676147.1540533031!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tougher penalties for drink drivers come into effect","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChief Supt Finbarr Murphy from the Roads Policing Bureau said An Garda Síochána would be ‘strictly enforcing’ the new measures. Photograph: Colin Keegan, Collins DublinTougher penalties for drink-drivers will be implemented from midnight on Thursday. Anyone caught with 50-80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood will be disqualified from driving for three months and receive a €200 fine from Friday. Previously, they would have received three penalty points and a fine for a first offence rather than an automatic ban. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport Shane Ross announced the commencement of the drink-driving provisions of the Road Traffic Act on Thursday. Mr Ross said it was wrong to allow people “who had driven while over the limit receive no disqualification and be able to drive away with a handful of penalty points”.“It sent the wrong message. It suggested a little drink-driving was no great harm. It is, and these provisions when commenced tomorrow, will provide the tougher measures to deal with this problem,” he said. Mr Ross acknowledged the Bill had a “very difficult time” going through the Dáil and accused some of his colleagues of delaying the provisions. “I never want to again see the sort of antics and filibustering which delayed this Bill and to see TDs going rogue in this way, I think it is offensive not just to other TDs but to other people who have suffered tragedies in their lives,” he said. Moyagh Murdock, chief executive of the Road Safety Authority (RSA), said drink-driving remained “a big problem in this country”. She said there was “a clear need” for stronger penalties to deter drink-driving. While the 50-80mg level is sometimes quoted as the equivalent to one pint or a glass of wine, the RSA said there was “no safe way to calculate how much alcohol you can drink and be safe, never mind legal to drive. Our advice is, as always, never ever drink and drive.”Chief Supt Finbarr Murphy from the Roads Policing Bureau said An Garda Síochána would be “strictly enforcing” the new measures. Describing the Act as a “first step”, Donna Price, founder and chairwoman of the Irish Road Victims Association, said “lots more needs to be done”. Ms Price’s son Darren was killed in 2006 when his car was hit by a HGV when he was on his way to college. “When you’ve lost a loved one in such a preventable collision, it’s absolutely soul destroying so we have gone all out to try to change the laws that needed to be changed, to ensure that all of our roads are kept safe for our families,” she told The . “We had to have a more effective deterrent for drink-drivers because the penalties that were in place simply weren’t working, people were continuing to take chances with their own lives and lives of others.” The second element of the Act provides that motorists who lend their car to an unaccompanied learner driver will face prosecution. This provision is due to commence from December 22nd."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3676617.1540551630!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"confusion over fianna f%C3%A1il candidate launch in northern ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEamon Ó Cuív and  Mark Daly with Sorcha McAnespy. Photograph: Fianna FailPA WireSorcha McAnespy was announced as a Fianna Fáil candidate last night for the local elections in the North next May by party veteran and director of elections Éamon Ó Cuív and Senator Mark Daly. The announcement was made at a party event in Omagh, Co Tyrone, with Mr Ó Cuív and Mr Daly unveiling Ms McAnespy’s election poster. The pair also circulated a press release detailing the announcement. However, shortly afterwards the Fianna Fáil Twitter account said the party had not made a decision to contest the Northern Ireland local elections. “Despite some reports, the party has made no decision with regard to contesting the 2019 NI local elections. The party is continuing its discussions with the SDLP,” the tweet said. Fianna Fáil and the Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP) have been in discussions about a potential merger in Northern Ireland. Options being explored include the parties running candidates on a joint ticket for the upcoming local elections and later running under the Fianna Fáil banner. On Friday a party spokeswoman said Fianna Fáil “has made no decision on whether or not it will contest elections in the North. It follows then that it has selected no candidate to contest these elections.” Ms McAnespy is a member of Fianna Fáil’s national executive, and is an independent councillor for Fermanagh and Omagh District Council.The press release detailing Ms McAnespy was to stand for Fianna Fáil in the elections stated she had been informed of the decision by party leader Micheál Martin.The confusion over Ms McAnespy’s candidacy played out on social media last night. Ian Woods, chair of party youth branch Ógra, said he was at the national executive meeting where Ms McAnespy was informed by Mr Martin that she would be contesting the local Northern Irish elections for the party. The event on Thursday was not advertised as the launch of Ms McAnespy’s campaign. Instead it was billed as a discussion on Brexit, and its consequences for the Belfast Agreement, and a potential united Ireland. Ms McAnespy was listed as chair of the discussion, which posters said would also feature Mr Ó Cuív and Mr Daly. Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Mr Daly denied he and Mr Ó Cuív “went rogue” in announcing the party’s first-ever candidate in Northern Ireland.“We were invited, I’m her director of elections. I was invited to launch the campaign as a public representative,” he said. “There is no procedure that announces candidates,” he added. However, one party source described the incident as a “solo run,” which “does not help” ongoing negotiations with the SDLP over a mooted merger. The final decision to approve Fianna Fáil election candidates is made by the party national executive. Commenting on the official party tweet that appeared to pour cold water on her candidacy announcement, Ms McAnespy said she was “dismayed,” and “not sure what that is about.” Speaking on RTÉ’s Today with Sean O’Rourke show on Friday, she said party discussions with the SDLP had “nothing to do with me.”“We’re an all island party, I can’t not run as a party candidate,” she said. When asked if she was officially told she would be a candidate, she said: “yes, I was told I would be a candidate at the national executive meeting.”She said she spoke with Mr Martin in April when “he offered me party support.”Ms McAnespy acknowledged she was previously a member of Sinn Féin, but said Fianna Fáil was her “natural home.”"},{"url":null,"title":"president higgins defends use of government jet on rt%C3%A9 debate","story":"  October 23, 2018Casey accuses incumbent of telling \u0026lsquolies\u0026rsquo as candidates trade criticisms in heated discussion   October 24, 2018Viewers of RT\u0026Eacute presidential debate got an even-handed free for all   October 24, 2018Prime Time\u0026rsquos presidential debate had no winners \u0026ndash and the big losers were its viewers   October 24, 2018RT\u0026Eacute figures show high levels of interest in final TV debate featuring all six candidates "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3675936.1540538044!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"presidential election everything you need to know before voting","story":"President Higgins casts his vote as the polls open in the 2018 Presidential election.  \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMarian Roarty presiding officer and Garda Eamonn McGinley after arriving by helicopter on Tory Island, off the coast of Co Donegal, with a ballot box for the presidential election and referendum on blasphemy. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WirePolls opened at 7am on Friday for the presidential election and a referendum on removing the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution.When you arrive at your polling station you will be asked to state your name and address. You may be required to produce evidence of identity, and may not be permitted to vote if you fail to do so. Where the presiding officer is satisfied as to the elector’s identity, a ballot paper is stamped and handed back to the person voting.On Friday there will be two ballot papers, one for the presidential election, which will have six candidates on it, and a second ballot for the referendum, which will have a Yes or No option. Polling stations will remain open until 10pm.On the ballot paper for the presidential election, the six candidates will be listed in alphabetical order according to their surname Peter Casey, Gavin Duffy, Joan Freeman, Seán Gallagher, Michael D Higgins, and Liadh Ní Riada. The voting system used in Ireland is called proportional representation - single transferable vote (PR-STV). Under this system the voter marks the candidates in order of preference, placing a number 1 in the box beside the candidate they wish to vote for, and then a number 2 beside their second preference, and so on. Voters do not have to fill in the entire ballot, and if they wish can mark the box beside their preferred candidate, and leave the rest blank. When the votes are being counted, if no candidate has secured enough first preference votes to be elected after the first count, the candidate with the least amount of votes will be eliminated. The eliminated candidates’ votes are then redistributed in the second count. If the candidate you voted for with your first preference is eliminated, your vote is then transferred to the candidate you gave your second preference to, during the second count. A candidate is eliminated after each count until one candidate reaches the quota and is deemed elected. The quota is half of the number of valid votes plus one. The other ballot that people will be asked to vote on is a referendum on whether to remove the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution. Blasphemy is defined as “the action or offence of speaking sacrilegiously about God or sacred things”. The last criminal prosecution for blasphemy in Ireland was in 1855.The referendum is proposing to remove the offence from the Constitution. Voters will receive a ballot paper that says “Do you approve of the proposal to amend the Constitution contained in the undermentioned Bill?”. Below this will be the name of the Bill: “Thirty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution (Repeal of offence of publication or utterance of blasphemous matter) Bill 2018.” The ballot paper will have two options, Yes or No. If you wish to vote to remove the offence of blasphemy, vote Yes. If you wish to vote against the proposal and keep the offence in the Constitution, vote No. The vote count will begin on Saturday morning, in centres across the country. You can follow the Presidential election and blasphemy referendum counts live with The  all weekend.

The use of Parliament in this way is healthy and it shows democracy at work.”Frank Field, the MP for Birkenhead who previously led condemnation of Sir Philip over the treatment of BHS pensioners, said: The charge sheet against the knighthood is growing. Parliament and the country have made their views clear on this matter. Ultimately it\u0027s a decision for the honours forfeiture committee.He added that he is planning to raise with ministers the need for a mechanism for abuse victims\u0027 voices to be heard in Parliament.Mr Field said: I have been talking this evening with somebody who witnessed grotesque bullying at work. They would like for what they witnessed to be shared, through the House of Commons, with the nation.I am seeking to raise urgently with the Government the importance of having a mechanism in Parliament through which the voices of victims of abuse can be heard.This would develop the role of the House of Commons in a way which stands up for people who have little money, against those who have much.Number 10 said that it could not comment on cases which were ongoing.Sir Philip Green refused to comment on “anything that has happened in court or was said in Parliament today” but denied any “unlawful sexual or racist behaviour”.The  has spent the past eight months investigating allegations of bullying, intimidation and sexual harassment made against the businessman, and the lengths he has gone to to cover up the claims. However, on Tuesday this newspaper was prevented from revealing details of the non-disclosure deals by Sir Terence Etherton, the Master of the Rolls, the second most senior judge in England and Wales.The intervention makes it illegal, outside Parliament or in reports of Parliamentary proceedings, to reveal the businessman’s identity or to identify the companies, as well as what he is accused of doing or how much he paid his alleged victims.It was the latest twist in a legal fight which began in July, which saw the appeal court rule that the confidentiality of contracts was more important than freedom of speech.It overturned a previous High Court ruling which found that publication of the allegations would be overwhelmingly in the public interest and would significantly contribute to debate in a democratic society.As well as re-igniting the #MeToo debate, the gagging of The  has renewed controversy about the use of injunctions to limit British press freedom.Lord Hain, the former Northern Ireland Secretary, told a hushed House of Lords: “My Lords, having been contacted by someone intimately involved in the case of a powerful businessman using non-disclosure agreements and substantial payments to conceal the truth about serious and repeated sexual harassment, racist abuse and bullying, which is compulsively continuing, I feel it’s my duty under parliamentary privilege to name Philip Green as the inidual in question given that the media have been subject to an injunction preventing publication of the full details of this story which is clearly in the public interest.”Lord Hain later told the BBC\u0027s Newsnight programme: What concerned me about this case was wealth, and power that comes with it, and abuse. That was what led me to act in the way that I did.There\u0027s no point in being in Westminster if you never deploy the precious rights of parliamentary privilege.After his statement Jess Phillips, the Labour MP who sits on the Women and Equalities Committee, said: “I think that today we have proven that wealth and power and arrogance will not always provide you with cover. Whilst people can be silenced with money, as is often the case, I am pleased that actually that has its limits and that we respect the spirit of the law when people like this are revealed.”Maria Miller, chair of the Women and Equalities Committee, added: “I think that given the huge influence that Philip Green has in the business world and the thousands of people that work for him it is surprising that the Court of Appeal decided that it wasn’t in the public interest to make this more public.“I think that we now have to answer another question when it comes to NDAs which is how we stop them being used to cover up serial offenders. That has to be a point that is answered by the Government proposals.”James Cleverly MP, deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, said Lord Hain\u0027s action had shown people must now realise that injunctions and super-injunctions are nothing more than a good way to part with large sums of money and a bad way to keep things secret.      The business world also reacted to the claims. Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General, said: “Sexual harassment and racial abuse is illegal and has absolutely no place in modern Britain. Accusations this serious must be thoroughly and quickly investigated.”   There has been days of speculation about the identity of the inidual, with several prominent businessmen including Lord Sugar and Duncan Bannatyne taking to social media to state that it was not them.In light of the scandal, the Judicial Office was forced to issued a rare statement emphasising that this was a “TEMPORARY injunction preventing publication only until there can be a trial.”There has been growing condemnation over the use of NDAs in this way from both campaigners and senior legal figures, including three former Home Secretaries, a former Director of Public Prosecutions and a former solicitor general.Amber Rudd, former Home Secretary, said: “My concern is that these are being used to intimidate people who would otherwise speak up about illegal activity, by that I mean sexual harassment.

I\u0027m not a racist person by any means and it\u0027s just a fit of temper at the time, I think.I apologise for all the distress you\u0027ve had there and since.Footage posted on social media appeared to show a plane passenger calling Delsie Gayle an ugly black b-----d and telling her don\u0027t speak to me in a foreign language, you stupid, ugly cow.But Ms Gayle and her daughter Carol Gayle rejected the apology over the language used on the plane from Barcelona to London on October 19.Asked if she accepts the apology, Delsie Gayle said: I don\u0027t think so. You must forget and forgive but it\u0027s going to take a long time for me to get over what he has done to me.Her daughter added: He says he wasn\u0027t racist, he wouldn\u0027t be saying words like that if he wasn\u0027t racist.The incident took place on Ryanair flight FR015 at Barcelona Airport on October 19, before it left for London Stansted.Ryanair passenger (pictured) filmed racially abusing woman on flight is identified by policeMr Mesher was was questioned by police for the first time on Wendesday as officers visited the 75-year-old at his home in Birmingham as part of a criminal investigation into the incident.Officers spent just under an hour at the sheltered housing flat before leaving without him.Before his retirement Mr Mesher is understood to have worked as a train announcer for London Midland Railways, and as a booking clerk at Waterloo station.He has never married, and lived with his elderly mother until her death in the late 1980s.On Wednesday night a relative, who did not wish to be named, said he hoped Mesher would be sent to prison if found to have committed a crime.“I saw that video and I would have stepped in to help that woman,” he said.“Someone on that plane should have done something. I don\u0027t care if he\u0027s blood. He should be put in a Spanish jail, I reckon.However a former colleague said Mesher’s outburst was out of character for the man he knew.“David worshipped his elderly mother, so he was always respectful and polite to older people,” the former railway worker said.Barcelona city council has said it will report the incident as a possible hate crime.Ryanair has been criticised for its handling of the incident as Mesher was not kicked off the flight. Instead, Mrs Gayle was moved to another aisle while Mesher was allowed to stay in his seat.Earlier this week, Mrs Gayle, 77, from east London, told ITV: I feel very low. He pays his fare, I pay mine. So why did he abuse me for that? Because of the colour of my skin.If I had done that to him, I\u0027m sure they would have called the police.Ms Gayle is due on Good Morning Britain to respond to Mr Mesher\u0027s apology. Ryanair issued a lengthy statement on Friday making a series of points to clarify the following facts, to prevent any further inaccurate andor unfounded media reportage.The airline defended its response, saying it has a long record of not tolerating disruptive or abusive passenger behaviour.Brexit latest: Allowing EU citizens to vote would push \u0026#39self-destruct button\u0026#39 on Tories, MEPs claim - live updatesQueer Eye: season three will feature a lesbian makeover as the Fab Five take on womenComment: Plenty of Tories want Mrs May\u0026#39s job, but few voters think they could do a better Brexit dealWhen do the clocks go back, why do we use GMT – and will the EU soon put an end to \u0026#39falling back\u0026#39?Sir Philip Green named in Parliament as businessman at centre of Britain\u0026#39s #MeToo scandalErdogan slams Saudi Arabia\u0026#39s \u0026#39childish\u0026#39 explanations of Jamal Khashoggi\u0026#39s deathMan arrested for trying to steal original 1215 Magna Carta from Salisbury Cathedral Tyson Fury holds workout ahead of Deontay Wilder fightSir Philip Green named as #MeToo scandal businessman by Lord Hain: How British newspapers reactedEbola outbreak spreads as war and disease threaten perfect storm Gavin Williamson wins funding battle for armed forces as Chancellor to pledge extra £500m in Budget\u0026#39Cesspool\u0026#39 Philippine holiday island Boracay reopens under strict new rulesFive reasons to stop turning the clocks backWho is Sir Philip Green?

Within a few years, it would be worth more than $10 billion and would eventually peak above $300 billion – surpassing the market cap of the payments giant Visa.Yet despite this success, bitcoin and the thousands of cryptocurrencies that have since appeared are still largely a fringe technology, unable to truly break into the mainstream. On its 10th anniversary,\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspspoke to a number of crypto experts who explain why this is and suggest how this might be about\u0026nbspto change.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearWhile bitcoin has taken off and is seen as the leader of the cryptocurrency market, it’s been adopted by the few not the many, said Chakib Bouda, chief technology officer at US-based payments firm Rambus.Confusion amongst users has played a part, but arguably the biggest failings for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over the past years lies with security, in the first six months of 2018 alone over $761 million bitcoin was stolen, with experts predicting that the amount stolen from exchanges will top $1.5 billion by the end of the year.The key to overcoming this issues, Bouda\u0026nbspsuggested, is keeping the private keys needed to access and use cryptocurrency funds both secure and easy-to-use.\u0026nbsp One way of doing this would be adopting technology used within the traditional financial sector to bring cryptocurrencies up to the levels of security and usability that people expect of a modern currency.Once this secure ecosystem is in place, it’s going to transform how many sceptics view bitcoin transactions, Bouda said. So whilst cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have been described as the ‘Wild West’ by the UK treasury, we expect that in 10 years’ time, bitcoin will become mainstream and have a remarkably different reputation.If bitcoin is able to transform its reputation in this way, bitcoin could find its way into everyone\u0027s pockets through mobile wallets –achieving\u0026nbspmainstream adoption\u0026nbspin time for bitcoin\u0027s next\u0026nbspbirthday.It\u0027s a view shared by Iqbal Gandham, the UK managing director of the online trading platform eToro. The next decade could see bitcoin being accepted as the norm when it comes to money transfer and payments, he said. As with any startup idea, early days are always risky, but I feel these are now few and far between.Alternatively, if another cryptocurrency is able to become a safe and\u0026nbspconvenient payment method\u0026nbspbefore bitcoin developers implement the necessary technology, bitcoin\u0027s place as the world\u0027s most popular cryptocurrency could be usurped.This is the view of Nigel Green, founder and CEO of the deVere\u0026nbspGroup, a financial consultancy firm based in London. Mr Green suggested that bitcoin\u0027s influence will drastically reduce in the cryptocurrency sector, however the overall crypto market will expand by at least 5,000 per cent.“Bitcoin is what kickstarted the crypto revolution and it has changed the way the world handles money, makes transactions, does business, and manages assets, amongst other things, forever.\u0026nbsp It all began with bitcoin, Mr Green said.\u0026nbsp“However, whilst I don’t wish to rain on anyone’s parade, I believe that\u0026nbspbitcoin’s influence and dominance of the cryptocurrency sector will drastically reduce in its second decade.\u0026nbspThis is because as mass adoption of cryptocurrency grows, more and more digital assets will be launched – by organisations in both the private and the public sectors. This will increase competition for bitcoin and dent its market share.He continued: “In addition, it is likely that bitcoin will be hit by the superior technology, features, and problem-solutions, offered by existing and yet-to-be-released cryptocurrencies.”If the deVere\u0026nbspCEO\u0027s forecast is correct, the boost from\u0026nbspmajor institutional and retail investors will see the cryptocurrency market rocket towards\u0026nbspthe $20 trillion mark by 2028.Financial institutions and regulators, amongst others, understand that cryptocurrencies are the future of money, he concluded.\u0026nbsp“As such, the market will have grown beyond recognition when bitcoin celebrates its 20th anniversary.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ben Chu reports from the Future Investment Initiative in RiyadhClick to followThe IndependentThe Saudi delegates, many of them working for state companies, were on message about the regimeIf you wanted to build a room in which to conceal an elephant it would probably have the dimensions of\u0026nbspthe opulent main hall of the King Abduaziz International conference centre in Riyadh.The neoclassical marble columns framing the rectangular space must be at least seven\u0026nbspmetres high. Crystal chandeliers hang from the stuccoed ceiling like enormous frozen explosions of bling. Everything is almost comically oversized.Everything we know about the death of Jamal KhashoggiBut even this aircraft hangar-sized Saudi Arabian ballroom could not hide one pachyderm this week: the killing of the dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom’s embassy in Istanbul earlier this month.Few spoke about it, but everyone was staring at it.The Saudi “Future Investment Initiative” – the\u0026nbsp“Davos in the desert” – was conceived as a way to suck foreign investment into the Saudi economy and to make a reality of the 33-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s “Vision 2030” economic reforms.But while “MBS”, as he is known, wants to attract foreign cash and foreign technical expertise he also wants foreign interest, foreign enthusiasm for a modernising Saudi Arabia.Before the conference began that seemed to be a dream that had been extinguished, along with the life of Khashoggi.Bosses from some of the world’s biggest corporations and financial companies – Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, Stephen\u0026nbspSchwarzman of Blackstone, Larry Fink of BlackRock, Masayoshi Son of Softbank to name but a few – dropped out in the wake of Khashoggi’s killing and the global wave of abhorrence about an act apparently ordered from Riyadh. Politicians did the same, from the US Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, to Christine Lagarde of the IMF, to our own trade secretary, Liam Fox.It was one of the most impressive no-show\u0026nbsplists in the history of parties.Yet anyone who had assumed that the conference\u0026nbspin the heart of the Saudi capital, which began on Tuesday,\u0026nbspwould have been a purely domestic, or regional, affair was mistaken. Chinese money managers and Indian business people had either not got the memo about the boycott, or did not care to join.\u0026nbspAnd there were a fair number of Western business delegates here in the sprawling Riyadh conference centre, although they tended to have less exalted titles such as “chief scientific officer” and “vice president international ision”. \u0026nbspMany were keeping a low profile and spoke about the Khashoggi case only obliquely as “the political situation”.“It’s not a good situation if the facts are as they seem,” said one Indian private equity magnate, sucking his teeth.Yet others were privately less concerned. “Look it was a mistake – but China does this kind of thing all the time and yet they get praised\u0026nbspfor being a huge infrastructure investor across the world,” complained one American. The Saudi delegates, many of them working for state companies, were on message.Most of the sessions, despite the lavish video presentations that accompanied them, were rather sparsely attended, with people preferring the mingle in small groups over Arabic tea in the\u0026nbspcorridors of the centre.But the 1,400 capacity hall was packed for the crown prince’s panel, where he would make his first public remarks since Khashoggi’s death.The stage management was not very subtle. Many of the delegates were wearing the traditional Saudi ankle-length white shirt and red-patterned headdress and a glance at their ID lanyards showed that many worked for state – or state-linked – Saudi firms. They cheered loudly\u0026nbspthe prince’s rather defiant statements and responded to his\u0026nbspjokes with ostentatious laughter.The\u0026nbspmotivation for the defiance was clear.\u0026nbspThe US and Turkey have brought extreme pressure on MBS over the killing. But there was also a clear domestic message too: “I’m not going to be toppled.”It’s not a fantastical proposition. The crown prince has alienated a lot of powerful Saudis – a year ago he locked dozens of them, including princes, in the Ritz-Carlton hotel, right next door to the very conference centre in which he was speaking, until they agreed to hand back assets to the state which they were accused of corruptly appropriating. Whatever the truth about the legitimacy of their claims to those assets, this was hardly a model of open justice and transparent government.Will it work? Did bin Salman shore up his position with his words?But, despite reports from Turkey this week that President Recep\u0026nbspTayyip\u0026nbspErdogan\u0026nbspis not set on regime change in Riyadh, Ankara seems determined to turn up the pressure on MBS\u0026nbspfurther over the killing. And, of course, nothing said before a friendly audience in Riyadh is likely to sway the White House and its erratic occupant.It seems fair to say that the fate of the crown prince remains in the balance.And so, inevitably, does that of his ambitious economic reforms, which include building a $500bn high-tech city in the desert and turning the kingdom into a tourist hub to rival Dubai.The crown prince boasted of $50bn of inward investment deals signed with Western energy and infrastructure firms at the conference. But there was little detail and some analysts said some were likely to have been projects that had already been announced.We will likely not know for many months how much damage has been done by the Khashoggi affair to the appetite of Western firms to invest in the kingdom. The irony is that few would deny that bin Salman has identified the right economic strategy – ersification away from the liquefied dinosaur export business known as oil. Around 40 per cent of the kingdom’s GDP and 90 per cent of Riyadh’s\u0026nbsptax revenues come\u0026nbspfrom fossil fuels at present. That is a precarious position in a world in which there is now a broadening (if not total) consensus that decarbonisation is environmentally and economically necessary. Jamal Khashoggi death ‘the worst cover up ever’Another rather bitter irony is that MBS’s\u0026nbspsocial reforms seem genuinely popular, especially among younger people.One single female Saudi economic consultant stressed to me over lunch in the heaving dining room of the Ritz-Carlton how important the granting of the freedom for women to drive cars was.“Before I had to have a driver. Now I can travel to meetings on my own. And it’s changing attitudes too. Men must now look at us as human beings not objects,” she said.“It’s a sexual revolution – I’m not joking,” said one European-based energy executive who comes to Saudi around 100 days every year. “You should tell your readers about that!”Yet MBS has not been a political reformer. Most non-partisan observers agree that the political realm is now\u0026nbspslammed shut. And the Khashoggi killing has sent a terrifying message to those who might have been minded to criticise the\u0026nbspregime.Another irony is that amid the uproar over the killing of Khashoggi another story has gone ignored. The United Nations warned this week that Yemen, where Saudi forces are attempting to suppresses a Houthi insurgency through a blockade, is on the brink of a “massive loss of life” due to famine.That, alas, was an elephant in the room that everyone at this week’s tense conference in the Arabian desert seemed to manage to ignore without any difficulty at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He was born in the Kerala region of southern India and his parents roamed the country working for the government as part of the rubber board. Then his father decided to go into the private sector, setting up as a producer of adhesives. “My dad wasn’t the best entrepreneur,” Janardana says. His father had no difficulty obtaining a line, or lines,\u0026nbspof credit – but not from entirely reputable sources. He was being charged 10 per cent per week i.e. a higher rate of interest than Wonga\u0026nbspused to levy. Labelling his father’s lenders\u0026nbsploan sharks is unfair to sharks. “Debt collection is not exactly regulated in India,” says Janardana the younger. “People were lining up outside the house screaming at us to give them their money back.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt was the son who paid them all off in the end. He studied engineering, worked in telecoms, rolling out the network in India, then went to business school, was hired by Capital One, and started in its credit card office in Washington DC. Fortunately the exchange rate of dollars to rupees was favourable at the time. Junior, then aged 24, salvaged the family finances. In April 2008, I was labelled a party\u0026nbsppooper. People said ‘it’s only a Wall Street\u0026nbspcrisis. It’s a US thing. We’re not in the\u0026nbspsubprime\u0026nbspmortgage business’“It’s more about reputation – face and respect – in India,” he says. “Sometimes your parents’ social security is you. To be fair, they wouldn’t have incurred so much debt if not for me. I was living off them for a long while.” In the wake of that traumatic experience, and while working for Capital One, lending to consumers, and having responsibility for collections and defaults, Janardana could feel defaulters’ pain. He was abnormally sensitive to any looming crisis. The year 2007 found him based in London. “We were all gung-ho for growth,” he says. But Janardana pointed out even when the economy was doing well, losses were piling up, and he forecast rocky times ahead.“In April 2008, I was labelled a party pooper. People said ‘it’s only a Wall Street crisis. It’s a US thing. We’re not in the subprime mortgage business’.” But Janardana’s warning was heeded and by September 2008, when everything unravelled, Capital One\u0026nbsphad a head start of three or four months, and had already shut down new custom\u0026nbspand reduced exposure. Still, “it wasn’t a fun time. Most of 2008 was spent just trying to survive.” By that\u0026nbsptime,\u0026nbspJanardana had decided not to return to the US, and to become a British citizen. Zopa attracted him because it was something completely different: a\u0026nbsp“peer-to-peer” system\u0026nbspin which investors and borrowers are brought together for mutual advantage, with Zopa in the middle, like the shaded area of a Venn diagram. One person’s loan is another’s investment. Investors do better than they would by parking money in a bank – albeit with higher risk – and borrowers get a much better deal than Janardana’s entrepreneurial father ever did. The typical borrowers are teachers and nurses in their mid-30s, often for the purpose of home improvements or buying a car. The average loan size is just under £10,000. With his engineering background, the thing that particularly pleased Janardana was how Zopa had managed to speed up the process of obtaining a loan. The business does its own risk assessment. But what really concentrated minds, was the question of comparison sites. Zopa had previously informed applicants if they could get a loan in 27 seconds flat. But Money Supermarket said approval had to be 12 seconds for it to show up on its site – Zopa got it down to seven. The exact rate is outlined within three minutes. “The real rate,” stresses Janardana, “not the ‘lowest rate’ – which is so misleading.” Janardana has been CEO since August 2015. “We’ve had a charmed four years,” he says. The business\u0026nbsphad a turnover of £265m in 2014-15, now it’s more than £1bn. Revenue has gone up from £11m to £45m. Customer satisfaction, according to Trust Pilot, hits 4.8 or 4.9 out of 5. Now Zopa is two years into building a fully-fledged online bank, and is running the registration gauntlet, performing the required stress tests. It\u0026nbspwants to “extend the ethos of peer-to-peer into retail banking”.The average amount people borrow from ZopaWe are sitting in the Zopa HQ on the south bank of the Thames, looking out at the river flowing languidly by, with the towers of the City leaning over it. It’s probably something to do with his personal history, and his mum and dad nearly going under, but when Janardana speaks of “giving customers more control”, it’s easy to feel the passion and conviction beyond the expression of good intentions. He objects to what he calls “the winlose model”. He ought to get a job as chancellor of the exchequer. In fact, he comes out with a line neither the chancellor – nor anyone else, other than Jeff Bezos\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspgets a chance to say very often. “We had too much money”. In other words, there was more lending than borrowing. Citizens Advice\u0026nbspknows\u0026nbspcustomers who renew loans generally get a worse rate than those who switch. Banks make money by upping the rate. “We could have pulled the same trick, but we don’t want to do that,” says Janardana, sounding a bit like Chris Tarrant on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. “With us you always get the same rate as a new customer. A bank where we win, and our customers win.” Even if he is CEO, Janardana still talks regularly to the guy who handles “complaints”. He wants people to be happy and sometimes Janardana speaks more like a yoga teacher than a money expert. It’s rather zen and soothing. “I want,” he says, “to take away the points of tension.”A View from the TopShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Its on-trend fashion ranges will complement our high quality Tu clothing offer and support our strategy to make our stores leading fashion destinations.”Hash Ladha, chief executive designate of Oasis, said: “Trialling Oasis in Sainsbury’s is an exciting development for us. This is about presenting the Oasis product proposition and brand experience to Sainsbury’s customers. The customer demographic of both brands is very similar and therefore it is a natural strategic partnership.”This is the latest in a string of deals Sainsbury’s has executed in a bid to ersify its offering and grow its customer base.

The companies are waiting for regulatory approval from the competition watchdog, which may require the closure of hundreds of stores before the takeover can go ahead. The CMA has said it will assess whether the merger “could lead to a worse outcome for shoppers through higher prices, a poorer shopping experience, or reductions in the range or quality of products offered”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Lady Green owns all of the shares in their company, Taveta, which is registered in Jersey and controls Arcadia.\u0026nbspSir Philip has claimed he chose to live in the principality\u0026nbspbecause of a “heart scare” he had twenty years ago.Lady Green has pointed out other benefits to tax havens: “My understanding is that jurisdictions such as Jersey and the British Virgin Islands are commonly preferred for their strong regulatory regimes,” she wrote to MPs\u0026nbspin 2016.The Arcadia Group is the clothing empire that made Sir Philip’s reputation as a retail king and remains the source of much of his wealth. It boasts some of the biggest names on the high street: Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, Wallis, Evans, Burton and - the jewel in the crown - Topshop, which has successfully expanded into the US in recent years.But the rapid upward trajectory has recently reversed with the Arcadia’s value being slashed by half in just a year. Topshop’s revenues dropped 5.6 per cent last year, in spite of a jump in online sales.Topshop lost £10.9m in the year to August 2017, compared with a £59.4m profit in the previous 12 months. It also has a worrying pension deficit of up to £1bn - not the first time one of Sir Philip’s companies have experienced problems in that regard.The tycoon bought BHS for £200m in 2000 and took it back into private ownership. He rebranded it as British Home Stores and brought it under his Arcadia umbrella before ridding himself of it in 2015, by which time it had racked up £1.3bn in debt including a large pension deficit.\u0026nbspUntil the recent sexual harassment allegations it was Sir Philip’s conduct during and after the disposal of BHS that had most tarnished reputation.Pensions committee chair Sir Frank Field summed it up succinctly earlier this year: “Sir Philip Green stripped BHS bare and then left it for dead, with contemptuous disregard for the pensioners.”\u0026nbspPhilip Green\u0027s case is proof that we need to get rid of NDAs for good£500,000 in 28 seconds is the fastest money Philip Green has ever lostPhilip Green named in parliament as businessman who gagged mediaSurrounding himself with \u0027yes\u0027 men was Philip Green’s undoingAre Sir Philip Green and Frank Field up for a rematch? Let\u0027s just seeThe businessman sold BHS for £1 to a company controlled by a Dominic Chappell, a man who had been declared bankrupt three times and had no retail experience.\u0026nbspThe chain collapsed into administration a year later, with 11,000 jobs lost and a £571m deficit in the pension scheme.\u0026nbspThe Pensions Regulator found that the “main purpose” of the transaction was so that Sir Philip could avoid liability for the fund which contained 22,000 people’s retirement savings.Sir Philip came under heavy and sustained fire from the regulator and MPs, before eventually making a voluntary payment of £363m to help make up the deficit.\u0026nbspMPs recommend former BHS owner Sir Philip Green is stripped of knighthoodSir Philip owns three luxurious yachts including the 295ft Lionheart which he bought for £100m at about the same time as he took collection of a £46m Gulfstream private jet and offloaded BHS.He was believed to be holidaying on the Lionheart in the Mediterranean when he stated in September 2016 that he was “working every day” to save the stricken retailer’s pension scheme.\u0026nbspThe previous month he was filmed\u0026nbspon the Greek Island of Ithaca attacking a reporter who tried to question him about BHS’ demise. “That’s going in the f***** sea,” Sir Philip shouted while pointing towards the reporter’s camera equipment.The Pensions Regulator said at the time that the vessel could be seized in order to generate cash to pay into the BHS fund. In the end he kept both the yacht and his knighthood, though there will now be renewed calls for him to be stripped of the latter.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Amazon shares dropped as much as 8 per cent in after-hours trading after it reported quarterly sales of $56.58bn (£44.16bn), missing expectations of $57.1bn. Alphabet’s stock fell 4.7 per cent after it posted revenue of $33.74bn, missing Wall Street’s target of $34.04bn, although earnings of $13.06 per share came in well ahead of the expected $10.42 per share. Google reveals it has sacked 48 employees over sexual harassmentGoogle leak reveals plans for censored search engine in ChinaEbay sues Amazon, accusing rival of illegally poaching sellersAmazon wage increase could result in lower pay for some employees“Google’s earnings momentum remains strong,” said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing. “But if you dig in a little deeper, there are cost pressures which are building up and are mainly responsible for this period’s disappointment.”Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said the “poorly received” earnings from Alphabet and Amazon had “soured the mood on what had been a rebounding US session”. However, Christopher Rossbach, CIO of investment firm J. Stern \u0026amp Co, said the companies both remain fundamentally strong, despite missing market expectations. “While their revenues were both slightly lower than expected, with Amazon additionally guiding slightly lower than street expectations for the next quarter, they still both show good profitability,” he said. \u0026nbsp“Alphabet is the leader in search and advertising, and Amazon is the leader in e-commerce and cloud computing, and increasingly benefits from advertising too. The fundamentals of both companies are intact and we believe that any significant weakness is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.”Other tech stocks that dipped in after-hours include Apple, which fell 1.6 per cent, and Twitter, which was down 2.5 per cent.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s not a particularly special sofa: it’s navy blue, from John Lewis, and lumpy from years of people wedging their arses into the cracks between the cushions. If you sit on the chaise longue too hard, it flips like a seesaw.For three and a half years, this sofa was a sort of talisman representing everything that I loved about my old life: home, comfort and belonging.I’ve just moved back to London from Hong Kong, that rocky, typhoon-drenched island off the coast of southern China. It’s nice to be home. I’ve gone from being Theresa May’s “citizen of the world as\u0026nbspa citizen of nowhere” to being a somewhere person again.And what a strange time to be back. The irony that I moved home desperate to belong somewhere again at precisely the same time that the UK is figuring out where and how it belongs itself, is not lost on me.I left the UK at the start of 2015 with my now husband. He’d transferred with his company (HSBC – it seemed obvious we’d end up in Asia), and I’d jacked in my lovely job as an editor on a travel magazine. We’d been living in London for years since graduating and just wanted a change of scene. Friends had started to inch down the aisle and I couldn’t bear many more winters of X Factor. My East Asia experience was limited: I’d been to Shanghai in 2011 to meet a friend and had come back with an unshakeable sense that Asia was where things were moving forward, rather than stalling in Europe.Hong Kong seemed a good choice. It was exotically far-flung, but at only (only!) 6,000 miles away it was close enough to be home in 15 hours and as a former British colony, it had a reassuring vein of home running through it (crucially, the plugs were the same). Plus, as a travel editor, the prospects for fun weekends away in cities like Tokyo, Bangkok and Beijing was intoxicating. Hong Kong was hot, humid, hedonistic and so fast-paced I figured I’d have to sprint to keep up.\u0026nbspThe problem? I’m a somewhere person. I never knew how much I relied on my emotional connection to my home city to inform much of my character until I left it.Hong Kong –\u0026nbspswaggering, sweaty, bombastic Hong Kong –\u0026nbspis an anywhere kind of place. The friends I made came from erse backgrounds and nations, with friends, ties and cultural touchpoints all over the world. By contrast, I came from a world of single culture: most of my family lives within two hours of each other (except one rogue uncle who lives in Malawi) and my close friends are the ones I’ve had since school. I first went on a plane at the embarrassingly old age of 15 (I don’t think anybody, least of all my Eurocamp-loving parents, thought I would end up flying a lot for work).Expat\u0026nbsplife was like being back at university, but with a lot more cashThe first year in Hong Kong was tough as I clung to my Britishness, my London-ness, like a comfort blanket. In my 350 square foot, two-bed flat in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong, I felt not so much fresh off the boat but flung sharply off it. The sights and smells of my new neighbourhood were almost literally intoxicating, and I couldn’t understand why the supermarket opened, begrudgingly, at 8.10am. I never knew where I was going, and I lost all the swagger I had in London about knowing the coolest, newest places to go. I missed my default lazy Sunday afternoon walking along the South Bank, popping into Tate Modern –\u0026nbspin Hong Kong, there didn’t seem to be any museum really worth a repeat visit. (This is a well-known problem –\u0026nbspfor a global city, Hong Kong doesn’t have any world-class institutions, although the recent opening of the Tai Kwun arts complex and the upcoming opening of the M+ visual arts centre is changing that.)In the UK, I fitted in. I knew this retrospectively because I’d never even considered that I hadn’t. It was a natural sort of belonging. My life revolved around the reassuring timestamps of ordinary British life: Strictly Come Dancing,\u0026nbspthe weird April heatwave\u0026nbspand the John Lewis Christmas ad. I still counted down to Christmas based on that the release of that ad.Eighteen months after we moved, Brexit happened.I can still remember the exact moment I found out that the UK had voted to leave the European Union. It was mid-morning in my glassy office block, and colleagues and I had stayed up watching the count.

In wealthy Hong Kong, there\u0027s a dark side to a housing boom, with hundreds of thousands of people forced to live in partitioned shoebox apartments, \u0027coffin homes\u0027 and other inadequate housingMy friends and family back home were at the coal face of it. My parents were sending me angry face emojis and announced they were moving to France (two years on they’re still in Essex – their plans to move are about as far along as Theresa May’s). Other friends who’d been up all night sent me bleary-eyed emojis and lightly indignant Whatsapp messages –\u0026nbspwasn’t I glad I lived all those miles away?At that point, the 6,000 mile chasm did feel just that: thousands of miles away. In Hong Kong, a very different type of politics talk was on the agenda for dinner-party conversation –\u0026nbspwould Hong Kong keep its independence or be squashed by China? –\u0026nbspand I sort of hoped Brexit might have collapsed under the weight of expectation by March 2019 anyway.Although in the year after it happened, I was glad to live away from the machinations and non-decisions and dreary refrains of “Brexit means Brexit”. Besides, as sterling fell through the floor, I’d managed to cream off more pounds for my Hong Kong dollars that ever before. I even tentatively posited that if the UK did leave the EU, I might as well set up home in Hong Kong instead.Theresa May’s 2017 speech, in which she derided the anywhere people who felt at home across the world, put into words the crude, untrue split between Leavers or Remainers. It was a defining moment for Brexit, and it was a defining moment for me. At the time, I was an “anywhere”\u0026nbspand couldn’t understand how people like me had become anathema to the national feeling. Most worrying was realising that the UK I ached for was not the UK I would find myself in if I moved back.And how I wanted to move back.\u0026nbspAround the time that May made her “citizen of nowhere” speech, I started to grudgingly accept that I must rather like living in Hong Kong –\u0026nbspafter all, I’d been there for two years. It was probably something to do with the lifestyle, which was hard not to love. Champagne brunches in the winter all-you-can-drink junk boat outings in the summer. Life was just easier: the subway always ran on time and you never woke up to a cold floor in the mornings, even in winter. I made true friends that put up with my constant existential whining about Hong Kong (if you’re reading: I’ll always be truly grateful).Plus, there were the opportunities. Expat life was like being back at university (when was the last time you heard a journalist compare Nottingham with Hong Kong?) but with a lot more cash. The people you met for drinks could introduce you to their entire network, and I met an average of six new people a week (in my six years in London, I think I met six new people in total). Somebody you knew was always doing something entrepreneurial –\u0026nbspthanks to the city being one of the most open places to do business in. Everybody knew everybody, which was comforting, until it started to feel suffocating. I couldn’t escape my job, even though I adored it.Eventually I came to realise that champagne brunches and low tax rates and the indifference I had for Hong Kong weren’t the things I wanted from my life or at least not one full enough for me to accept. The fact I lived 12 flying hours away from family and my closest friends, who were getting married and sprogging with alarming briskness, weighed on me heavily. I had planned my own wedding long-distance and it felt like it was happening to somebody else during much of our 18-month engagement.\u0026nbspIn Hong Kong, I always felt hollow at the fact that I didn’t speak the same language, or share the same culture –\u0026nbspor even the adopted expat one. In Asia, I felt more British and stuck in my ways than ever, which seemed like the opposite of the person I thought I was in Britain.And so the decision to move back wasn’t the proverbial lightning bolt. It was a slow blistering of the feeling that me, living in Hong Kong, wasn’t quite right. I frequently felt angry and upset and weak that I couldn’t settle in this most intoxicating of cities. The longer it went on, the more the issue of Brexit started to feel more and more abstract, and in some ways I was grateful for it happening: weren’t we lucky to live in a place that had at least some autonomy, however blunt, over the way the country was run?And so three and a half years almost to the day after setting foot on Hong Kong Island, I ditched the territory for Gatwick Airport (maybe the most British of all airports –\u0026nbspchaos inside, then surrounded by the gorgeous South Downs outside). I even left without my husband, such was my rush to move back.I’ve been home for around two months now, working for The Independent, where I don’t need to be careful about how I talk about China’s nationality complex: I can now write the words “Taiwan”\u0026nbspand “country”\u0026nbspnext to each other. I’ve realised that democracy means more than just voting for my next leader. It means being able to live in a place where I can speak freely, and be part of a dynamic and shouty media landscape unafraid to say what it thinks.The first night I was back, jet lagged and drunk after a bottle and more of wine, I cried in front of my friends about it being “the end of an era” –\u0026nbspand it is. I’ve transitioned with frightening ease back to my old life: I’m living in the same flat, I have the same friends, and I’ve gone back to eating the same thing for dinner. It’s almost like my three and half years abroad never happened.\u0026nbspThe crude difference is that I’ve reacquainted myself with the UK’s sluggish public services and an increased level of danger –\u0026nbspessentially the spoils that come with an open nation.Tangibly, plenty has changed. In the three and a half years I was away, my London neighbourhood, SE1, has sprouted an outdoor food market, and some hip performance space in what was a car park. The UK has its second female prime minister. I can pay for the Tube using Apple Pay, and everybody uses Uber\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspif they’re not getting on the Night Tube. Half the high street has disappeared and isn’t it great I can pick up my Amazon parcel from a locker?China defends decision to deny work visa for Financial Times editor Bus travel hits 12-year-low as prices rise and services axedWhere do the limits lie for ultra-long-haul air travel?And intangibly, plenty has changed. I feel like a different person. I’ve visited some of the most densely populated cities on earth that aren’t well-known (yet) in the UK. I’ve embedded myself into a culture completely separate from my own and seen how the developing world views the UK. I’ve learned\u0026nbspscraps of Mandarin and known bone-crushing loneliness. I’ve transitioned back to being the well-travelled one among my friends, whereas in Hong Kong I felt like the polar opposite.I can’t say it wasn’t gut-wrenching to leave a life and friends I loved, although the idea of not living in my home country again tore at something even more primal –\u0026nbspBrexit or no Brexit. I’ve at last accepted that I just didn’t like Hong Kong that much, however much I enjoyed the lifestyle.Now, back in London, I have moments of such vibrating happiness to walk along some dingy street in Elephant and Castle I feel I might burst. I wait for a delayed train and my heart feels full (I know, weird).\u0026nbspI’m back in my city, and I’m back on my sofa.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The companies said the pair-up is expected to be a success because Sainsbury’s and Oasis cater to very similar demographics. Two Oasis concessions will open at Sainsbury’s supermarkets before Christmas at Sydenham in south London and at Selly Oak, near Birmingham. Sainsbury\u0027s sales growth slows as it slashes pricesSainsbury’s launches new vegan range due to increasing demandMPs accuse Sainsbury’s of giving staff ultimatum over new pay dealsSainsbury’s said these two locations had been “carefully selected” because they are stores where the Tu clothing range performs “particularly strongly”. Sainsbury’s director of commercial, James Brown, said: “We are delighted to be welcoming Oasis to Sainsbury’s stores. Its on-trend fashion ranges will complement our high quality Tu clothing offer and support our strategy to make our stores leading fashion destinations.”Hash Ladha, chief executive designate of Oasis, said: “Trialling Oasis in Sainsbury’s is an exciting development for us. This is about presenting the Oasis product proposition and brand experience to Sainsbury’s customers. The customer demographic of both brands is very similar and therefore it is a natural strategic partnership.”This is the latest in a string of deals Sainsbury’s has executed in a bid to ersify its offering and grow its customer base. The retailer has previously agreed partnerships with Clarks and Specsavers. Meanwhile, the group is in the process of buying Asda, which will make it the UK’s biggest retailer, ahead of Tesco, if the deal completes. The companies are waiting for regulatory approval from the competition watchdog, which may require the closure of hundreds of stores before the takeover can go ahead. The CMA has said it will assess whether the merger “could lead to a worse outcome for shoppers through higher prices, a poorer shopping experience, or reductions in the range or quality of products offered”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Lady Green owns all of the shares in their company, Taveta, which is registered in Jersey and controls Arcadia.\u0026nbspSir Philip has claimed he chose to live in the principality\u0026nbspbecause of a “heart scare” he had twenty years ago.Lady Green has pointed out other benefits to tax havens: “My understanding is that jurisdictions such as Jersey and the British Virgin Islands are commonly preferred for their strong regulatory regimes,” she wrote to MPs\u0026nbspin 2016.The Arcadia Group is the clothing empire that made Sir Philip’s reputation as a retail king and remains the source of much of his wealth. It boasts some of the biggest names on the high street: Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, Wallis, Evans, Burton and - the jewel in the crown - Topshop, which has successfully expanded into the US in recent years.But the rapid upward trajectory has recently reversed with the Arcadia’s value being slashed by half in just a year. Topshop’s revenues dropped 5.6 per cent last year, in spite of a jump in online sales.Topshop lost £10.9m in the year to August 2017, compared with a £59.4m profit in the previous 12 months. It also has a worrying pension deficit of up to £1bn - not the first time one of Sir Philip’s companies have experienced problems in that regard.The tycoon bought BHS for £200m in 2000 and took it back into private ownership. He rebranded it as British Home Stores and brought it under his Arcadia umbrella before ridding himself of it in 2015, by which time it had racked up £1.3bn in debt including a large pension deficit.\u0026nbspUntil the recent sexual harassment allegations it was Sir Philip’s conduct during and after the disposal of BHS that had most tarnished reputation.Pensions committee chair Sir Frank Field summed it up succinctly earlier this year: “Sir Philip Green stripped BHS bare and then left it for dead, with contemptuous disregard for the pensioners.”\u0026nbspPhilip Green\u0027s case is proof that we need to get rid of NDAs for good£500,000 in 28 seconds is the fastest money Philip Green has ever lostPhilip Green named in parliament as businessman who gagged mediaSurrounding himself with \u0027yes\u0027 men was Philip Green’s undoingAre Sir Philip Green and Frank Field up for a rematch? Let\u0027s just seeThe businessman sold BHS for £1 to a company controlled by a Dominic Chappell, a man who had been declared bankrupt three times and had no retail experience.\u0026nbspThe chain collapsed into administration a year later, with 11,000 jobs lost and a £571m deficit in the pension scheme.\u0026nbspThe Pensions Regulator found that the “main purpose” of the transaction was so that Sir Philip could avoid liability for the fund which contained 22,000 people’s retirement savings.Sir Philip came under heavy and sustained fire from the regulator and MPs, before eventually making a voluntary payment of £363m to help make up the deficit.\u0026nbspMPs recommend former BHS owner Sir Philip Green is stripped of knighthoodSir Philip owns three luxurious yachts including the 295ft Lionheart which he bought for £100m at about the same time as he took collection of a £46m Gulfstream private jet and offloaded BHS.He was believed to be holidaying on the Lionheart in the Mediterranean when he stated in September 2016 that he was “working every day” to save the stricken retailer’s pension scheme.\u0026nbspThe previous month he was filmed\u0026nbspon the Greek Island of Ithaca attacking a reporter who tried to question him about BHS’ demise. “That’s going in the f***** sea,” Sir Philip shouted while pointing towards the reporter’s camera equipment.The Pensions Regulator said at the time that the vessel could be seized in order to generate cash to pay into the BHS fund. In the end he kept both the yacht and his knighthood, though there will now be renewed calls for him to be stripped of the latter.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Campaigners say they are alarmed that the proposal appears to be going ahead despite the lack of a formal public consultation, environmental assessment or parliamentary enquiry.“If given the green light, this development will change the face of England’s countryside forever. Yet no formal assessment of the environmental impact it will have has taken place,” said Paul Miner, head of strategic plans and devolution at CPRE.“Despite costing at least £5.5bn in public money, there has been no formal public consultation around developing the Arc. The lack of debate equates to a major, and troubling, democratic deficit at the heart of the proposals.”Hundreds of thousands urge government to stop fast-tracking frackingGreen MEP for the South East Keith Taylor said the study revealed “the terrifying extent of the impact of the Oxford-Cambridge Arc”, and questioned the legality of pushing ahead without consulting with local communities.“It clearer than ever that the project a monumental disaster and act of environmental sabotage,” he said.Responding to the claims,\u0026nbspan NIC spokesman\u0026nbspsaid: “Our recommendations come with the clear condition that new schemes should not compromise the high quality natural environment for existing and future residents, and do not need to involve any changes to existing Green Belt protections.“In fact, our report made clear the need for significant investment in landscape improvements, affordable housing and sustainable transport. These changes are vital to make the most of the area’s economic potential and the contribution it makes to the wider UK economy.”CPRE\u0026nbsphas called for a full assessment to be conducted that looks at the impact on people’s health and wellbeing as well as environmental impacts including climate change.Instead of investing in the new expressway, the group called for investment in improved public transport in the region alongside a commitment to building “genuinely affordable homes”.The government is aiming to build 300,000 new homes need to be built each year in England to meet demand, and experts have warned of significant backlogs.Mr Brokenshire said: “The Oxford-Cambridge Arc is an opportunity to further strengthen rural economies, enhance the environment and benefit local communities.“Our new planning rulebook strengthens protections for the Green Belt and\u0026nbsp we have sets out our ambition to ensure housing projects are more environmentally friendly.”Campaign to Protect Rural EnglandShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We will take responsibility and sort out this mess with a people’s vote.”Speaking to The Independent beforehand, she said many Tory MPs were privately supportive of a second referendum amid bitter isions in the party.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said the sheer scale of the event showed that “confidence is growing” in the fight for a fresh vote.To huge cheers, London mayor Sadiq Khan said the march marked a\u0026nbsp“historic moment in our democracy”.Over 700,000 protesters’ call for second Brexit referendumTheresa May told she’s ‘heading for dead end’ in Brexit talksThe collective spreading cheer to Brexit-weary BritsEx-cabinet secretaries condemn Tory Brexiteers for undermining MayFinal Say: Meet some of the people marching a fresh Brexit vote He told protestors: “We’ve heard some complain that a public vote would be undemocratic and unpatriotic. But the opposite is true.“There’s nothing more democratic – nothing more British – than trusting the people to have the final say on our future.”MPs from across the political spectrum addressed the rally, including Green MP Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Labour’s Chuka Umunna and Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, who drew huge cheers when she compared\u0026nbspBrexit to a botched operation.Christian Broughton, editor of The Independent,\u0026nbsptold the crowds: “Theresa May says that the Final Say referendum will be a politicians’ vote, not a people’s vote, but we can all remember what some politicians told us in 2016.“We, the people, can all now see what’s really coming. And from where I’m standing it looks like a people’s vote to me.”He revealed that The Independent’s petition for a Final Say had achieved more than 940,000 signatures, adding: “We have to keep on showing up and signing up.”People did show up in their thousands for the march, which was extremely cheerful, except for a handful of Ukip protestors who screamed\u0026nbsp“Losers”\u0026nbspat passers-by from outside Downing Street.An army of students, college pupils and young activists led the march in a sign of the impact of the Brexit vote on the younger generation, some 1.4 million of whom have become eligible to vote since the referendum.Femi Oluwole, from the youth group Our Future Our Choice, told The Independent: “What we are trying to do is bring people together, as nobody has any confidence in what the government is doing.”He said young people were going to be hit hardest by Brexit, both economically and in the opportunities to live and work abroad.Among the crowds was Piero Passet, a 71-year-old restaurant owner from Turin, said he was marching because he was concerned for the future of the younger generation.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

This is my firm belief and this is my understanding of democracy.”Mr Bullmann’s intervention is particularly significant because EU figures have so far been reticent to call for a second vote – for fear they might be seen as interfering in Britain\u0027s\u0026nbsppolitics.But the vast show of support on the streets of the capital has apparently encouraged some in Brussels and Strasbourg to break cover and speak out.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

It is only right that they have a say in their nation’s future.”Mr Hutton added: “This careful analysis shows just how badly young people – already disadvantaged by the breakdown of career structures and high housing costs – will be further hit by Brexit.”And Mr\u0026nbspOluwole said: “Now that the implications for our generation have become clear, we need a People’s Vote on the government’s Brexit deal.”The research comes as the Brexit talks remain deadlocked over the issue of the Irish border backstop – with just five months until departure day next March.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Understanding the ‘clans’ offers valuable insights into who might want what from Brexit and how this might affect future elections, or indeed referendum outcomes.”Between the 2015 and 2017 election both Labour and the Tories increased their share in many of the groups, squeezing out smaller parties.Created with Sketch.How big are the UK\u0027s voter clans and how do they vote?

Amazon shares dropped as much as 8 per cent in after-hours trading after it reported quarterly sales of $56.58bn (£44.16bn), missing expectations of $57.1bn. Alphabet’s stock fell 4.7 per cent after it posted revenue of $33.74bn, missing Wall Street’s target of $34.04bn, although earnings of $13.06 per share came in well ahead of the expected $10.42 per share. Google reveals it has sacked 48 employees over sexual harassmentGoogle leak reveals plans for censored search engine in ChinaEbay sues Amazon, accusing rival of illegally poaching sellersAmazon wage increase could result in lower pay for some employees“Google’s earnings momentum remains strong,” said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing. “But if you dig in a little deeper, there are cost pressures which are building up and are mainly responsible for this period’s disappointment.”Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said the “poorly received” earnings from Alphabet and Amazon had “soured the mood on what had been a rebounding US session”. However, Christopher Rossbach, CIO of investment firm J. Stern \u0026amp Co, said the companies both remain fundamentally strong, despite missing market expectations. “While their revenues were both slightly lower than expected, with Amazon additionally guiding slightly lower than street expectations for the next quarter, they still both show good profitability,” he said. \u0026nbsp“Alphabet is the leader in search and advertising, and Amazon is the leader in e-commerce and cloud computing, and increasingly benefits from advertising too. The fundamentals of both companies are intact and we believe that any significant weakness is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.”Other tech stocks that dipped in after-hours include Apple, which fell 1.6 per cent, and Twitter, which was down 2.5 per cent.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So is Hammond’s next door.Whoever takes over — Boris, David Davis or Jeremy Hunt — needs an emergency clear-out.The big guns of the Treasury need to be pointed at the “enemy” not its own side.After two long, wasted years, Britain is engaged in an unexpectedly desperate fight, not just to salvage Brexit but to save British democracy.Weekend crowds demanding a second referendum seem oblivious to the threat such a crazy re-run would pose to this nation’s centuries-old stability, ironically the envy of Europe.We cannot reverse the  referendum without turning Brexit into a perpetual running sore. And Britain can never rejoin the EU except on its knees.The only way to put this corrosive issue to bed is for Brexit to succeed — as it will, despite treacherous Tony Blair and Facebook hypocrite Nick Clegg.To succeed as we must we need a new chancellor as well as a new prime minister.Diehard Remainer Phil Hammond should be first out the door.It was Spreadsheet Phil who vetoed vital preparations for No Deal — now a better-than - prospect with time rapidly running out.And it was Hammond who surrendered the one negotiating weapon Brussels fears most — a thriving, low-tax Britain competing with the EU on its doorstep.Our economic fate is entirely in our hands. We can make taxes and tarfs as competitive as we like.Better investment incentives and lower corporation tax rates would trigger a flood of foreign investment in UK plc — and ensure car makers like Nissan and Toyota never leave our shores.Yet the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has ruled them out.“Phil is like those Harry Potter Dementor creatures,” says a top Tory. “He sucks the le out of any room he happens to be in.”Hammond is easily replaced. Michael Gove, an ex-future PM but a formidable Cabinet minister, has the drive and imagination to take on the Treasury “Blob”.There is no shortage of Brexit talent on the Tory benches.Just compare thundering Attorney General Geoffrey Cox QC with prissy dried-stick predecessor Dominic Grieve.Grieve is busy sabotaging Brexit. Cox finds ways to make it work.He is now “marking Number Ten’s homework” on Mrs May’s wretched Northern Ireland “backstop”.Some even tip him as a dark horse in the leadership stakes.There is one other big change needed at the heart of Britain’s Brexit team.Our next PM must have a new EU negotiator.Nobody could be worse than Olly Robbins, already reportedly eyeing up a £m-a-year golden parachute into a top City job.Lelong Europhile Robbins has led Mrs May into so many disastrous EU traps — especially her humiliation in Salzburg — he is often cast as an EU “double agent”.It was Robbins who told EU negotiator Michel Barnier that Britain might stay indefinitely in “transition” while the fantasy Northern Ireland backstop was sorted out.And pay £bn more on top of the £bn ransom for the privilege.The idea that Robbins is the “EU’s man in Whitehall” is not such a stretch when you consider his Jeremy Corbyn-style applause for Communist Russia.Kremlin leaders, he told fellow Oxford students in , “changed Russia from a backward peasant autocracy, despised by the West, into a technological giant at whom the world cowered in fear for half a century.”Everyone is entitled to youthful naivety.But can anyone imagine Olly Robbins fighting our corner for EU democracy and accountability, let alone the referendum verdict of .m Brexit-voting Brits SAUDI Arabia’s rulers must be really annoyed with dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.This elderly trouble maker walked alone into his country’s Turkish consulate knowing he might never emerge alive.He was clearly looking for trouble.Once inside, using his bare hands, he attacked a gang of  innocent Saudi torturers who had just flown in for a couple of hours’ holiday armed only with a bone saw and a hypodermic syringe.Then, to the embarrassment of kindly Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, he went and hid his own body.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Smoking tobacco is bad news.But vaping is dferent.You heat up a solution called an e-liquid, which typically contains nicotine, a propellant called propylene glycol and or vegetable glycerin and flavourings.What you don’t do is burn tobacco or produce tar or carbon monoxide — two of the most harmful elements of all in tobacco smoke.Sure, some vapes may contain a fraction of some of the harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke, but they are present at much lower levels,detectable at all.So are they safe  According to all the international medically-reviewed evidence from such expert organisations as Public Health England, the Royal Colleges of Physicians and General Practitioners, the British Medical Association and Cancer Research UK, e-cigarettes are at least  per cent safer than traditional cigarettes.The American Cancer Society and the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine both agree with them.Yes, the nicotine, of course, is addictive. But so what  So is caffeine, even eating.Contrary to popular belief, nicotine does not give you cancer and it is relatively harmless generally.Apparently only  per cent of the population know this.Happily, there is no evidence of harm to other people from vaping and,used instead of nicotine replacement gum or patches, may even help expectant mums remain smoke-free in the long term.As a doctor I don’t want any young person or non-nicotine user to try vaping. Ever. Period.As it happens, regular use of e-cigs among “never” smokers is still very rare at just . per cent.But look at what they’ve done to help tobacco smokers quit.In the UK, .million vapers have quit smoking completely and more than , have given up both smoking and vaping.In fact, this is Britain’s most popular method of quitting with two-thirds stopping successfully when used alongside professional stop-smoking NHS support.In this country we have some of the strictest regulations in the world.E-cigs are subject to minimum standards of quality and safety as well as clear packaging and labelling requirements.All ingredients have to be notied, advertising is prohibited in media such as television, newspapers and magazines, it is illegal to sell them to under s and to adults intending to pass them on to under s.That is responsible regulation whichever way you look at it.This month’s national Stoptober campaign recommends using e- cigarettes as a stop-smoking aid andit helps some of the million smokers in the UK kick the habit for good then perhaps doctors like me will see fewer people in our surgeries struggling to breath or devastated by a cancer diagnosis.AndI see any ex-smoking patients of mine having a quiet vape outside my surgery door, I shall give them a heartfelt pat on the back and cherish the fact that there will be one less nasty fag end polluting the street.NICOTINE contained in e-liquids is a highly addictive substance that raises blood pressure and spikes your adrenalin, increasing the chances of having a heart attack.This is particularly worrying as we see a number of iniduals who are constantly vaping, especially as it is seen as more convenient and cost-effective than lighting up a cigarette, as well as being considered more socially acceptable to vape indoors.While vaping appears to be safer than cigarettes, the truth is that it hasn’t been around long enough for us to know the potential damage it can cause to our health.The long-term effects of the chemicals contained in e-liquids haven’t been examined.However, I have looked into ious research that has been carried out on certain e-liquids that were found to contain substances that can cause damage to the immune system and are linked to other health conditions such as cancer.Vaping isn’t great for your oral health either.It’s common for vaping to cause a dry mouth, and I’ve met a number of iniduals who have developed oral thrush, most likely caused by vaping.Although nicotine does not have a colour, it becomes yellow when combined with oxygen which could lead to tooth discolouration.As nicotine is a vasocon-strictor, it limits blood flow in oral tissue, which can cause gum disease and bad breath.As time goes on, I am reading new research which proves vaping has a negative effect on health.To what extent, only time will tell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sit down and work out what it is you don’t like about the position and set yourself a task of getting a new one.Be very dedicated and very professional and excel when you get to the interview.Many people don’t realise that when you are invited for an interview it is because they believe you can do the job.The secret is convincing them that you can do the job better than anyone .You should be able to talk about your specialist subject, which is yourself.People find it very dficult to list all the things they have done really well in a professional way to show good examples of why they can do the job.Opening a negotiation is all about knowing your worth.And knowing your value is really about your self-worth. They are totally linked.Write down all the things where you have made a big ­contribution, all the things that you have changed and made a dference, how you have added value. Put together testimonials to really back up what you have done.Then work out what more you want to do, because going above and beyond your job description is very important.Take out all the emotion, go in and lay out for your boss the facts of what you’ve contributed to the organisation.Sometimes people can be very passive. They say: “I’ll go along with what everyone  agrees with.”They want to avoid conflict. They don’t really think their opinion is as important as other people’s, so they are simply giving others a licence to ignore them.Learn to say no. Say: “I don’t really have the time butI can make the time I can do it for you.” Otherwise you become like a human sponge. Don’t let them take advantage.Employers take advantage of women’s lack of confidence, especially a mother ing from maternity leave. Many feel so grateful to have a job that they tend to put up with almost anything.Eleven per cent of new mothers report that they have been dismissed or made redundant where others in their workplace were not, or were treated so poorly they felt they had to leave.That means as many as , women are losing their jobs each year.Have a really clear plan of how you will manage at home and manage work.

Ms Knightley, who adds, “Rescue yourself,” clearly feels she is protecting daughter Edie by banning something that doesn’t concur with her own off-the-shelf, Poundland version of what feminism should be.But what she’s in danger of doing is wilfully nurturing a potential “snowflake” who, rather than develop the critical thinking skills that allow healthy debate, will simply stick their fingers in their ears and cry foul when they see or hear something that dfers from their own world view.Keira, tonight’s homework is to really readCinderella and analyse it.Look past the Disney-esque cute rodents, pretty frocks and glass slippers and instead dig a little deeper to ­appreciate the original’s narrative of how hope can turn unjust oppression into ­triumphant reward.Cinderella is a young woman who has not only suffered the loss of her loving father, but now faces a letime of abuse from an uncaring stepmother and her equally unpleasant daughters.But instead of sitting in the ashes ­waiting unquestioningly for whatever fate might have in store for her, she remains resolutely ­optimistic and decides to secretly defy her nemesis by gatecrashing a hot-ticket party to which she hasn’t been invited.Now that’s girl power.Ultimately, she “‘rescues” herself by proactively going to the ball where, instead of abuse, she experiences the redemptive qualities of love and kindness.They just happen to come in the form of a handsome prince.In the same week, Kristen Bell — who coincidentally voices Anna in the Disney film Frozen — found herself caught up in the slipstream of Keira’s PC virtue signalling after reportedly saying that Snow White gives young girls the wrong ­message about consent “because you cannot kiss someonethey’re sleeping”.Except Kristen’s comment was taken out of context and she’s got the balance right.Because what she actually said was that she reads the story with her two ­daughters, aged five and three, then asks them: “Don’t you think it’s weird that Snow White didn’t ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple ” before starting up a conversation about the dos and don’ts of taking food from strangers.Or, “Don’t you think that it’s weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission ” to float an almost subliminal, age-appropriate understanding of what does and doesn’t constitute ­consent.Kristen isn’t banning tales of old, she’s using them to stimulate discussions.In other words, teaching her children the vital le skills of critical thinking — dictionary definition: “the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment” — and being able to rationally debate that judgment with someone whose view might dfer from your own.Attempting to sanitise a child’s world by airbrushing history will hinder, not help them.Instead, wield history’s lessons as a tool to educate.Cinderella was of its time and now the Disney pendulum has seemingly swung the other way to depict a world where all the central characters are feisty, opinionated young women who power-kick their way through le.But how will Keira’s daughter know how far the depiction of Disney ­princesses has comeshe’s not allowed to see where they’ve been ONE morning last week, I spent a glorious couple of hours walking around Westminster Abbey.Buried or commemorated there are, among others, more than , great Britonsincluding Sir Isaac Newton, Jane Austen, Noel Coward, Charles Darwin, the Bronte sisters, Clement Attlee, Charles Dickens, David Livingstone, Stephen Hawking and, of course, the grave of the unknown warrior, buried on November ,  “in honour of the many multitudes who during the Great War of - gave the most that man can give . . . le itself.”My mother works at the Abbey as a “blue-gowner” – the volunteer guides there to answer any questions not covered by the electronic headsets – and, while showing us the ft by ft grave of poet Ben Jonson, who is the only person there to be buried upright, she was approached by a couple of earnest-looking women in their early twenties.Amid such a rich seam of history, rigorous intellect and achievement, what did they ask “Excuse me, where did David Beckham sit for the royal wedding ”THE number of stay-at-home dads has dropped to the lowest level in five years.Experts reckon it could be due to men “growing tired” of the tough job of raising kids.Proof,needed, might be the glassy-eyed expression of Bond actor Daniel Craig,  just six weeks after we Rachel Weisz gave birth to their daughter.He never looks this knackered when he’s jumping off buildings and dodging bullets.Stay-at-home parenthood can be isolating, sometimes dull, frequently thankless and relentlessly bloody exhausting. Only the strong survive it.THANKS to Ryanair’s ­astonishing failure to act when a passenger racially abused Windrush immigrant Delsie Gayle on one of its flights, the man will likely escape prosecution because of jurisdictional issues once a plane takes off from one country’s airspace to another.Instead, he is likely only to be banned from ever travelling on Ryanair again.Which, as plenty of the budget airline’s past ­customers might tell you, could equally be regarded as a blessing rather than a punishment.COMEDIAN Seann Walsh and his Strictly partner Katya Jones have survived the dreaded dance-off to, presumably, jive another day.Because, let’s face it, since that snog, the Strictly bosses are ­rapidly running out of drearily chaste dances to give them.Last weekend it was the unsexy Charleston, ­performed in equally unsexy “Where’s Wally” outfits that virtually screamed “nothing to see here”. Then this weekend it was a faintly ­ludicrous, undeniably platonic quickstep that saw them trotting around the floor like a couple of hyperactive show ponies.Assuming the sizzling Argentine tango is, er, strictly no-go, whatever next  A jive in burkas  A Viennese waltz in sackcloths Not least from Tom himself, perhaps, whose first we Mimi Rogers bemoaned the lack of intimacy in their union because, she claims, he wanted to be a monk and “thought he had to be celibate to maintain the purity of his instrument, but my instrument needed tuning, and we had to split.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He laughed at me, Daud tells Sun Online.He later took McGowan to court and won damages, but his local council didn’t prosecute.“I will never forget that night as long as I live,” Daud says.“I went home at pm in a neck brace to find all my worldly possessions, including a ripped photo of my mum on her wedding day in Somalia, thrown into the street.“I had nowhere to go, and that night I felt suicidal. I saw no point in living.A friend offered him a temporary place to stay.Three years on, Daud, now , is proudly running his own community centre in Brent - All Nations - helping people from all ethnic backgrounds with problems such as the one he experienced. He also has a council property to call home.“That night changed my le and made me realise that I was going to have to start my le all over again. I love helping people and I am proud of the work I do.”Property owner Bernard McGowan boasts of having a £m portfolio but has been convicted six times since , and was fined more than £, for property offences last year.His tenants have complained of intimidation, electricity being disconnected, locks being changed and deposits never being ed - and of forced evictions from homes riddled with cold, damp and vermin, sometimes with beds and personal possessions strewn outside the front doors.Many of McGowan’s tenants are vulnerable. Erskine Clarke was sleeping rough before the council housed him in a West London property costing almost £ a week for a ft x ft room in a shared house with mould, a faulty boiler and a leaking toilet.Erskine says requests for repairs to McGowan were ignored, and the boiler problem went on for two years, resulting in no heating or hot water.He still lives at the property but now has a new landlord who is renovating it.The scarred tenant adds: “Nobody should be living in the state it was in. It made me depressed. I lost a lot of weight and got very sick. Why does the government let people do this But sadly, Doud and Erskine arent the only tenants suffering.Between  and , landlord Gary Fixter, , failed to act on repeated warnings to improve the standard of his properties, despite collecting £, a year in rent and earning a salary of £, a year as an IT consultant.He pleaded guilty to  offences between  and , with eight convictions for renting out substandard shared houses, often without heating, water supplies or fire alarms.He rented out a shed for £ a month, a property with live wires spilling out from the mains electrical unit, and another infested with rats.One of those hoping for justice for private rental tenants is -year-old Askel Douglas, who last year was spending every penny of his £ a week universal credit on a Neasden flat above a supermarket in London which flooded three times.“I was totally ripped off by my private landlord, Askel, who has now moved, told The Sun Online.There was water coming out of the walls and ceilings so it was knee-deep and a total mess, and stinking, dirty water was coming up through the plug so I couldn’t even have a bath.Jacky Peacock OBE, is director of London charity AdviceRenters, which is campaigning for reform of the private renting sector.She and her colleagues regularly witness the appalling standards in domestic renting which can be so bad they make tenants ill.“The things I see are atrocious. Filthy flats in a state of complete disrepair, but also we see many problems with overcrowding,” Jacky told The Sun Online.“People are exploited by employers as well as landlords, often migrant workers who are hardly paid anything, and they end up in these dreadful places, trying to raise their children.“We recently saw a Hungarian couple who lived with their six-year-old child in one small room. The husband was a mini cab driver who worked all hours to earn money for them, and he came back to the property one day to find the landlord had let himself into the room and was molesting his we.“The landlord brandished a kitchen kne and tried to stab the tenant – this is the kind of atrocious thing we’re seeing day after day. It makes me so angry that vulnerable people are exploited like this.”Access to a ing, clean kitchen can be dficult when people are crowded into one property.“We were in a flat last week where the sink leaked, so every time the tap went on, the downstairs flat was flooded. The landlord had been to fix it but basically he’d just propped it up,” says Jacky.She believes a flood of amateur landlords – buy-to-let owners investing in property with no knowledge of their legal responsibilities – are making the problem worse.AdviceRenters is urging the government to introduce and enforce a national regulatory scheme for the private rental sector.The charity shared a series of recent photographs with The Sun Online, all of them taken in London properties in shocking states of disrepair.They show damp, rotten fire escapes, leaking toilets, sinks and showers and boarded-up windows.Tenants suffering at the hands of unscrupulous landlords are often on low incomes or benefits - people with no bargaining power and little choice as to where they live. They’re crammed into houses in large and dangerous numbers andthey complain, they’re evicted.A grim roster of greedy iniduals taking cruel advantage of society’s most vulnerable has been revealed in an investigation by ITV News.Rogue landlords are collecting rents – often funded by taxpayers via housing benefit – despite being convicted of housing offences and failing to pass the “fit and proper” person tests required by housing legislation in England and Wales.Because of the way the law is written, this is usually perfectly legal.The government’s efforts to police rogue landlords have been branded “weak” and “pathetic” after the investigation found convicted landlords continuing to operate through loopholes in the law.In response, Heather Wheeler MP, the minister for housing and homelessness, has said: “Everyone deserves a decent and safe place to live, and we are reforming the private rented sector to make it fairer for all.”Angry tenant Askel blasts: “I can’t understand why the government lets people like me get ripped off for every penny we have.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He also needs to find an extra #.bn a year in real terms to fund Mrs Mays NHS commitments.The chancellor is also under pressure from Tory backbenchers to cancel a planned increase in income tax allowancesin order to reverse cuts to Universal Credit for Britains lowest earners.But in such a fraught political environment it is unlikely that the chancellor will do very much at all this time around.Fiscally, its dficult to calculate how much the public finances will be affected by Brexit when we still dont knowthe UK will be leaving with a deal or not.Politically, Mrs May is in a very dangerous place in parliament, with both the DUP and Tory MPs threatening rebellions over Brexit.Against that backdrop, Mr Hammond will be hoping to get through the budget without incident. Ending austerity will have to wait. HEALTHPaul Kelso, health correspondentI am looking out for... what the plan is for public health and social care. The NHS is in the unfamiliar position of wondering \"how\", not \"how much\" from the budget.The government has already promised the health service a .% funding increase for the next five years, and indicated that taxes will rise to pay for it.But that only covers core NHS spending, and so the chancellors speech will be watched closely for information on other crucial areas, including public health budgets and social care.Both of those are currently in the gt of local government, but without investment in them, demand for NHS services will continue apace.NHS executives are currently working on a long-term plan, outlining what the public can expect from the health service.It is effectively a justication for the tax increase the chancellor will announce in the budget, but we wont see it for several weeks afterwards.Given the ambition of delivering improved cancer and mental health treatment, it is likely compromises will be required in areas including non-urgent care. ECONOMYEd Conway, economics editorI am looking out for...the chancellor manages to break out of the restraints imposed on him.Ever since the era of Gordon Brown, the chancellor has had two big annual opportunities to deliver major changes to the UK economy.When he came into office, Philip Hammond changed that: as well as shting the budget from the spring into the autumn, he proclaimed that from now on there would only be a single major fiscal event every year. One change to sht the needle every  months.The great irony is that now Mr Hammonds single shot has come around, he is so penned in that there is not all that much he can do.The biggest elephant in the room is Brexit. We are still days, week, possibly months away from having a deal on Brexit - and until that is determined, there is little point in the chancellor making major fiscal plans.The second issue is that without a majority, the government has little scope to introduce radical policies. The final constraint is that the prime minister has also laid down some crucial red lines.In her party conference speech earlier this month, Mrs May promised to end austerity. She has also committed to considerable extra spending on the NHS.Those two commitments mean Mr Hammond has little leeway. Happily, tax receipts have come in much stronger than expected in recent months, so he no longer needs to raise taxes considerably to fulfil those aims.The budget will be a steady-as-she-goes affair. A survival budget."},{"url":null,"title":"esther mcvey shuts door journalist","story":"NewsEsther McVey shuts door on journalist askingTory minister is in denial about Universal CreditThe Work and Pensions Secretary fled TV cameras this morning after an audit report blasted her for presiding over a \"department in denial\"ShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsAn audit report blasted her for presiding over a department in denial \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Tory Esther McVey has shut the door on a journalist askingshe is in denial about the hated benefit shake-up Universal Credit .

The former cabinet minister used parliamentary privilege to name the Topshop tycoon after the Dailywas barred from publishing allegations of sexual harassment and racial abuse against him. The paper wants to reveal confidential information from five employees, who have been prevented from discussing their claims by non-disclosure agreements . But Sir Philip categorically and wholly denied being guilty of any unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, in a statement issued hours after the Labour peers dramatic intervention in the House of Lords.  Lord Hain told BBC Twos Newsnight he had received overwhelming support - particularly from women. Lord Hain told peers he had been contacted by someone intimately involved in the case and felt it was his duty to use parliamentary privilege to name Sir Philip. Having been contacted by somebody intimately involved in the case of a powerful businessman using non-disclosure agreements and substantial payments to conceal the truth about serious and repeated sexual harassment, racist abuse and bullying, which is compulsively continuing, I feel its my duty under parliamentary privilege to name Philip Green as the inidual in question given that the media have been subject to an injunction preventing publication of the full details of a story which is clearly in the public interest, he said.  Lord Hain later confirmed his statement referred to the chairman of Arcadia Group, whose brands include Topshop, Topman, Wallis, Evans, Burton, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins and Outfit. Sir Philip responded in a statement, saying: I am not commenting on anything that has happened in court or was said in Parliament today. To the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations. Arcadia and I take accusations and grievances from employees very seriously and in the event that one is raised, it is thoroughly investigated. Arcadia employs more than , people and in common with many large businesses sometimes receives formal complaints from employees. In some cases these are settled with the agreement of all parties and their legal advisers. These settlements are confidential so I cannot comment further on them.  The principle of parliamentary privilege means that MPs and peers cannot be sued for libel for comments made in the Houses of Parliament, and offers protection to media outlets reporting those comments. Speaking to Newsnight, Lord Hain explained his decision to speak out, saying: What concerned me about this case was wealth, and power that comes with it, and abuse. And that was what led me to act in the way that I did. Its for others to judge whether Ive been right or wrong. But theres no point in being in Westminster - which is the sovereign centre of the British constitution, has sovereignty and with it the parliamentary privilege that is a privilege ...you never discharge thatyou never deploy the precious rights of parliamentary privilege.  He stressed that the cloak of privilege should be used extremely carefully with integrity and very responsibly - never just loosely. On Wednesday, Theresa May pledged to hasten measures to improve regulation around so-called gagging clauses in response to questions about the case. The Prime Minister said some employers are using NDAs unethically as she criticised abhorrent sexual harassment in the workplace. Mrs Mays spokesman declined to comment on Lord Hains statement. Askedthe PM feels it is acceptable for parliamentarians to use the protection of privilege to put information into the public domain in this way, the spokesman said: The rules of parliamentary privilege are a matter for Parliament and how they exercise these rules is obviously a matter for inidual members.  Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said Sir Philip narrowly and luckily escaped losing his knighthood over the pensions scandal. And he added: If these allegations are correct, he should certainly be stripped of his knighthood. Labour equalities spokeswoman Dawn Butler said: While much of the focus in the coming days will be on this man and his alleged actions, let us also pay tribute to survivors of sexual abuse and harassment, who are too often silenced and cannot command an army of lawyers to fight their corner. NDAs should never be used to suppress allegations of criminal behaviour. If the current law doesnt protect the voices of survivors, the next Labour government will legislate to do so. Conservative MP James Cleverly said Lord Hains action had shown people must now realise that injunctions and super-injunctions are nothing more than a good way to part with large sums of money and a bad way to keep things secret.

The tycoon was today unmasked in Parliament by Lord Hain as the figure accused of trying to gag the allegations. Greens expensive efforts to remain anonymous over sexual harassment claims were ended in Parliament today. Veteran politician Peter Hain used parliamentary privilege to name Green in the Lords – something he would not be able to do outside the House. And the move sparked further demands for businessman Green to be stripped of his shyknighthood after he managed to cling on to it despite the collapse of the BHS chain with the loss of , jobs and a poundmillion pension black hole.  The -year-old had used a court injunction to stop the Dailyfrom revealing he was the figure who agreed financial settlements and non-disclosure agreements with alleged victims of sexual shyharassment, racist abuse and bullying. Green denies all the allegations. Sir Vince Cable said: “I find it dficult to see how he could credibly hold on to an honour in these circumstances. “He narrowly and luckily escaped losing his knighthood over the pensions scandal. If these allegations are correct, he should certainly be stripped of his knighthood.” Labour MP Clive Lewis added: “If he has used his wealth to gag people and given the disgrace of what happened on the BHS pensions, how that was basically asset-stripped and the lives of thousands potentially ruined, I think it says a lot about this countrysomeone like that can be given a shyknighthood and keep their knighthood having the reputation they do.” Neil Saunders, managing director of industry experts Global Data Retail, warned the claims against Topshop boss Green could be potentially damaging to his business.  He said: “While the allegations are only claims and have not yet been legally proven, Philip Green’s association with them is highly damaging for both him and the retail businesses he owns. “Unless the claims are proven to be  then there is no coming back. The stench of sexual misconduct lingers for le.” Women and Equalities Select Committee chair Maria Miller blasted judges for granting the gagging order. She said: “Given the huge influence Philip Green wields in the world of business it is surprising the Court of Appeal decided it wasn’t in the public interest to make public the string of payments that have been made.” Thespent eight months investigating the claims against Green. But on Tuesday, it was prevented from revealing the existence of a string of non-disclosure deals after a ruling by senior judge Sir Terence Etherton, the Master of the Rolls.  Green hired a team of seven lawyers and reportedly spent nearly pound, on legal fees. But Labour minister Lord Hain told the Lords: “I had been contacted by someone intimately involved in the case of a powerful shybusinessman using non-disclosure agreements and substantial payments to conceal the truth about serious and repeated sexual harassment, racist abuse and bullying. “I feel it’s my duty under shyparliamentary privilege to name Philip Green as the inidual in shyquestion given that the media have been subject to an shyinjunction preventing shypublication of the full details of this story which is clearly in the public interest.” Lord Hain said later: “I’m not disputing judges’ shyresponsibilities or timing or anything like that, that’s a matter for the judiciary. “I’m just charging my duty as a parliamentarian and what concerned me about this case was wealth, and power that comes with it, and abuse. “And that was what led me to act in the way that I did.”  Arcadia chief Green broke his silence last night to insist: “To the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations.” The interim court injunction made it illegal to reveal Green’s identity or name his companies, as well as details of the claims against him. The -page ruling states that in five cases “substantial payments” were made to five people who accused Green of “discreditable conduct”. It added: “In all five cases the complaints were compromised by settlement agreements under which shysubstantial payments were made to the complainants.”  Under these shyagreements “both sides undertook to keep confidential the subject matter of the complaints”. The ruling did not shyidenty any iniduals but stated that “the most serious allegations of specic and particularised incidents are denied” by the businessman. Theprovided the court with “no corroboration of those incidents but only the allegations of the employees”. A previous High Court ruling, which could only be reported this week, found in favour of the , stating that “in all the circumstances, the public interest in publication outweighs any confidentiality attaching to the information”. But the Appeal Court ruled this week the judge “left out of account the important and legitimate role played by non-disclosure shyagreements in the consensual shysettlement of disputes”. It ruled: “There is a real prospect that publication by thewill cause immediate, substantial and possibly irreversible harm to all of the claimants.” Green’s lawyers Schillings have worked for shyCristiano Ronaldo, Lance Armstrong and Ryan Giggs, all who have used NDAs or shyinjunctions to silence those accusing them of wrongdoing.

The six-in-one benefit is meant to make welfare easier and fairer, but its been bundled up with cuts that MPs warn cause unacceptable hardship.The Department for Work and Pensionshas been blasted for being in denial about the problems by Parliaments public spending watchdog. Meanwhile Christmas is fast approaching - and thousands of families face the risk of a financial gap over the holiday season. Thats because there is a standard five-week wait for your first payment when you start claiming Universal Credit.  Soyou start claiming at the end of November or midway through December, you are unlikely to get your first payment until the New Year. And to make matters worse, UC is being introduced in more than  Jobcentres in a final two-month rush before the end of the year. Redcar and Clevelands council leader Sue Jeffrey has claimed up to  families moving to Universal Credit face Christmas without money in her area alone. She told the Teesside Gazette: They will also not have access to the services who might be able to support them.  “This council, for example closes down over Christmas, and there are range of other organisations that will do the same.” But there is a way to avoid being high and dry, and not everyone is affected. So how do you knowyoure hit, and what action should you take  Heres a guide. What is Universal Credit   One system to replace six benefits: Child Tax Credit, Working Tax Credit, Jobseekers Allowance, Income Support, Employment Support Allowance and Housing Benefit. Tory minister Iain Duncan Smith launched it in  to make work pay, by ensuring your benefits taper away slowly as you earn more salary, rather than vanishing in one go. Am I being moved on to Universal Credit   If you are on one of the above benefits, then yes. But this article only deals with people who are being moved onto Universal Credit at the moment. Universal Credit is rolling out in two phases, and its important to know which one youre in. The first phase is already happening now - the second phase isnt. The first phase - people who ARE affected New claimants and existing claimants whose circumstances change are being put on the benefit right now. This process started in one area at a time, with each Jobcentre having its own launch date. The first Jobcentre launched UC in November . Now its in almost every Jobcentre, and the final  will launch it in November and December . That means that by this Christmas, anyone who makes a new claim anywhere in Britain will be put on Universal Credit. There were already .million people in this position by September . By May  it will be million, and by December  itll be million. The second phase - people who ARENT affected Up to million existing claimants will move onto UC later through a process called managed migration. They are not affected by the issue in this article. Unlike in the first phase, they will be able to access a poundbillion transition fund to ensure their benefit payments dont suddenly drop. They will also mostly not start moving over until summer .Only , people are being moved over in the first year from July  after Tory ministers slowed the process down. But beware - evenyoure an existing claimant, you could still be moved earlierthe DWP decides youve had a change of circumstances. So why the focus on Christmas   Campaigners fears are greatest when Universal Credit is new to an area. It means Jobcentre staff are dealing with their first cases under the new benefit, which its claimed could lead to teething problems and delays. So while anyone who claims from late November faces a wait over Christmas, its those in new Universal Credit areas who are being highlighted. There will be  Jobcentres launching Universal Credit in November and December. We have listed those areas in full at the bottom of this article. How do I ensure Im not left high and dry   Its important to know the DWP has a system to ensure your money is not cut off. Its called an advance payment. As soon as you make a claim for Universal Credit, you can apply for % of your first months payment. You apply through your online account or Jobcentre work coach, and it should arrive within five days. If you need help applying, call  . But theres a huge drawback - you have to pay the advance back out of your future benefits. The repayments can be spread over  months and there is no interest. Elsewhere, housing benefit will also keep being paid for the first two weeks of a Universal Credit claim, to help bridge the gap. The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition.

The spell-binding cantata was sung in Windsor Castles St Georges Chapel by Welsh soprano Elin Manahan and featured David Blackadder as the trumpet soloist.  Harry, speaking in the audio commentary notes for a new Windsor Castle exhibition about his wedding, said: I was looking for something completely dferent and ended up stumbling across this piece of music. Something that epitomises the whole day, the whole feeling that I have for her, and this incredibly impactful music with no organ whatsoever, with a soloist who actually did the most incredible job, to the orchestra. And now, both of us, wherever we are, whatever were doing, we can close our eyes, listen to that music and take ourselves straight back to that moment. Its a beautul thing for both of us.

The Duchess of Sussex politely curtsied as she greeted the Queen of Tonga following a whistle-stop stay on the island. Before heading back to Sydney for the Invictus Games, Harry and Meghan were driven to the Royal Palace for an audience with King Tupou VI and his we Queen Nanasipau’u. The couple entered the wooden, whitewashed palace and spent around  minutes inside with the royals.  The Duke and Duchess signed a visitor’s book before they left and then posed outside with the king and queen for photographers. They also shook hands with the Tongan ruler and his we, Meghan, noticeably curtsying to the Queen. Meghan injected a splash of colour into Friday afternoons royal engagements with a bold blue dress. She had a quick outfit change, ditching her earlier striped frock for a pound shirt dress by American designer brand Veronica Beard.  The royal couple visited Tupou College, where they dedicated two forest reserves to the Queens Commonwealth Canopy. The QCC is a project which sees countries of the Commonwealth designate areas of indigenous forest to be preserved in perpetuity, with  of the  member countries already taking part.  Speaking at Tupou College, the duke said: Tonga is leading by example and understands deeply the impact of environmental changes because they directly affect these islands. Planting trees and conserving forests helps us in so many ways. It is a simple but effective way to restore and repair our environment, clean the air, protect habitat and enhance our health and wellbeing.  We are so very grateful to you for this contribution of the Toloa Forest Reserve and the Eua National Park Forest Reserve. During a ceremony which featured hymns, with Harry appearing to sing along to Guide Me O Thou Great Redeemer, the duke and duchess smiled at each other. Harry was then taken on a tour of the forest while the schools band and pupils continued to sing.  Earlier on Friday, Meghan wore a Martin Grant dress with a large bow covering her baby bump as she joined Prince Harry to meet the Tongan Prime Minister. The couple were met by more than  civil servants wearing red and black shirts and traditional outfits, as they entered the St George Government Buildings for a meeting with PM ʻAkilisi Pohiva and his cabinet. One child held a sign saying free hugs which Meghan spotted and smiled. The couple then took the lt to meet the Prime Minister, who was at last nights black tie banquet with the Tongan royal family and the Sussexes, with Harry asking Did you enjoy last night  The entertainment was very good. The remainder of the meeting was held in private.  Meghans pound, cotton dress is from the SS  Resort Collection. It is described as having a button-down silhouette, mandarin collar, circle skirt and belted accent at the waist. Meghan has previously worn a trench coat from the collection during this tour. The couple later had floral garlands placed round their necks as they arrived for a noisy celebration of Tongan youth and culture. Harry and Meghan joined Princess Angelika and Prince Ata, Kings Tupou VIs son and daughter, at the Faonelua Centre, showing products such as traditional mats and tapa cloth, carvings, bracelets made from whale bone and wood. Inside, they sat on two throne-like chairs in the centre of the room, while Princess Angelika delivered a short address and called the couple an inspiration to the youth of the Commonwealth for shining a light on youth empowerment.  She said: Your visit today draws attention to the fundamentals of todays youth, youth leadership, youth empowerment and addressing the social, economic and environmental challenges of our region. Your visits inspires and has been an inspiration for the youth of Tonga to be the best they can be. You are a beacon of hope to us all. Outside, the couple were given a Taovalawhich signies Tongan respect to the higher ranks. They met local Tongan traders and craftsmen as the Masani group of singers and dancers performed island music and songs. Harry appeared to do a little jig as the music started. The Sussexes will also visit the oldest secondary school in the Pacic where two forest reserves will be dedicated to the Queens Commonwealth Canopy Project.  They will then fly to Sydney from Fuaamotu airport in the afternoon. And they are straight back into engagements in Australia as they attend the Australian Geographic Society Awards at the Shangri-La Hotel in the evening. At last nights banquet with King Tupou VI and Queen Nanasipau’u Nuku’alofa, Harry said he felt ashe was visiting an extended family and delivered a message from the Queen. Her message was: Your Majesties, it gives me great pleasure that my grandson and his we are visiting The Kingdom of Tonga. Our two families have enjoyed a deep and warm friendship over many years, and I hope that our close relationship continues with the next generation. To this day, I remember with fondness Queen Salotes attendance at my own Coronation, while Prince Philip and I have cherished memories from our three wonderful visits to your country in ,  and . In the months and years ahead, I wish Your Majesties and the people of Tonga every good fortune and happiness.  The duke had high praise for Tongas talents in many dferent fields. He said: Tongan soldiers served with our allies during the First and Second World Wars and later independently to offer support in Iraq and Afghanistan. Tongan hospitality is world renowned your islands are stunningly beautul offering tourists rugged coastlines, humpback whales and coral reefs. Tongas sporting prowess is legendary you are formidable on the rugby pitch , and you were the first Pacic island nation to win a medal at the Olympics! Is there no end to your talents  Tongan artists such as Uili Lousi are winning international awards and your magnicent artefacts were a highlight at the recent Oceania exhibition in London, which my we enjoyed very much when she opened it. For a small population you have a very large presence on the world stage - a product of your talent and drive. We are both so looking forward to meeting many of you tomorrow- learning more about your culture and development as a strong and independent country.

The Duchess of Sussex wore a striking floor- white dress to attend a reception and dinner with the King and Queen of Tonga. The incredible dress is by New York based fashion label THEIA under Irish creative director Don ONeill. Don, , has been speaking about his experience with the dress after he was reportedly contacted by Meghans stylist last month. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Royal Tour: Best photos from Day  of Duke and Duchess trip The designer said he sent the dress to the palace within two days, but was asked for it to be remade with extra seam allowance. We knew immediately why this extra allowance was required, but Mums the word, he told FEMAIL. It wasnt until several weeks later that the news of the couples pregnancy was announced to the world, so it would appear the dress designer had to keep the secret to himself.  The brand is inspired by the Greek Goddess Theia and the dress itself featured cap sleeves and beaded detailing on the shoulders. The website states: Inspired by the Greek Goddess THEIA, this evening wear, bridal and day dress collection was created to bring out every womans inner goddess. One of the original Titans, THEIA who ruled during the Greek Golden Age, possessed the incredible power of light which radiated from her sparkling eyes. All that she gazed upon glittered, becoming luminous and radiant.  She imbued gold and silver with their shine. She gave diamonds their fire and rubies and emeralds their sparkle. Her three children Helios the sun, Celene the moon, and Eos the dawn, all continue to bring light in to the world everyday. The woman who wears THEIA will be filled with confidence knowing her dress fits wonderfully and looks beautul on her, thus naturally allowing her inner goddess to shine.

At  years of age and not five feet tall, she’s the closest thing you’ll find to a real-le superhero. She works for a charity called TRAC out of a small shop in Trevethin, Gwent. Trevethin has it harder than most, but it’s not unlike far too many other communities across the country that would recognise what’s happening there. Council budgets slashed, public services decimated, foodbanks, mental health issues, domestic violence, the effects of Universal Credit. “I don’t want to swear”, says Sue, “but, you know, we’re saving lives here because others have given up on the people that get referred to us.”  With a small team of staff and committed volunteers, Sue makes sure the basics are there for people who need them – furniture, clothing, food, fuel, white goods. Some of them are reclaimed from landfill, others are donations from all over the area. Care agencies refer people who need help to TRAC, and within hours provisions are on their way. Sue delivers them herself, her head just visible above her van’s steering wheel. “We’re trying to prevent them from going to doorstep lenders and shycompanies like BrightHouse,” she says. “I’m paying out on the van now and it’s not going to last much longer.” With so many services in the area being cut back – mental health services, hostels, council support and welfare – the need for Sue’s help is only increasing.

Amanda Smith used to run a company inspecting buildings before she became a sex toy designer for a British firm. Her business meetings now usually involve penetrating discussions about sex, fetishes and fantasies. The -year-old says the saucy job suits her far better and shes become a sexologist to her friends thanks to her fantastic role in a highly-competitive market. This week, Sainsburys has announced it is going to start selling vibrators prices from just pound alongside groceries.  Amanda, of Royston, Herts, said: Basically, I sell orgasms for a living and, in business meetings, the topic of conversation can go anywhere - we discuss every fetish and fantasy. “I was talking to an accountant two weeks ago and had to explain to him how a willy ring worked while discussing budgets. Just another ordinary day.” As head of buying at Essex firm Bondara - an online adult sex shop - Amanda is responsible for everything from organizing testing  to designing the saucy toys. She said: “Designing a sex toy is like going back to a biology lesson, I have to think about dferent nerves, dferent areas, and ways to stimulate them - this helps determine a lot about a toy.  “Once I get the basic biology side of things sorted, that’s when I start to put fun add-ons onto the toys, like vibrations and rotations and dferent textures to create new sensations. “I have to cater to a huge market. Dferent interests, fantasies and fetishes are always on my mind. I focus on the G spots, C spots and P spots - a lot of spots to think about.” Amanda, whose daughter Kayla is  years old, swapped the nine to five - running a company inspecting buildings - for her current role in . She had previously worked as senior buyer for sex toys and lingerie firm Ann Summers. She said: I left this kind of business for a while, as, a single mum, it gave me flexibility to look after my daughter, who thinks its great that her mum works so independently. But, working in property, I spent too much time alone and Im a gregarious person. This suits me far better.  Amanda said shes never looked back and her friends love her new role. She laughed: They envy me having such a fantastic job. I am their sexologist and relationship expert in the psychology of sex and intimacy. As for meeting new people, when they find out what I do, theres often an immediate outburst of excitement, followed by a download of their sexual experiences and questions about their curiosities. Meanwhile, her partner of two years, Tony, a -year-old luxury car firm director, is unfazed by her saucy line of work. She said: Hes interested in who I am, not what I do. But men Ive dated before him have assumed I was promiscuous and have overstepped the mark very quickly.  One ex even introduced me, saying, This is my girlfriend and she works as a buyer for Ann Summers. After that, people were more interested in my job than getting to know me for who I am. Amanda says nothing related to sex shocks her anymore, given her line of work. She added: “I have so much exposure to the sex industry that there isn’t much I haven’t seen. The world of online porn has meant there isn’t a corner or crevasse which I haven’t seen for my research. “Some things have made me more curious about what people want but, so far, nothing has taken me by surprise - other than bondage, which can be a bit out there.  When the  Shades of Grey trilogy hit screens we saw an overnight boom in demand for sex toys. “After viewers saw the scene which features the spreader bar - a piece of bondage equipment - the toy completely sold out. There was a  Shades effect across the whole market place, from MS to the likes of us.” But designing sex toys is not all about thrills - as it can be deeply demanding in a highly competitive market. She said: “Our toys need to be able to give people a climax and thats a lot to ask. We also have to try and spot the next new thrill I try to see the new popular toy design before the customer knows they even want it. “For example, suction toys for ladies are the new thrill - they feature suction and vibration, working together. This new technology could come out later this year - and I hope it will be the next step for women’s toys.” Selling orgasms comes with the additional perk of creating true happiness for some couples, according to Amanda.  She explained: “It’s great, I’ve been able to help couples restore relationships with the use of sex toys. Although my job is all about making sure customers have sexual pleasure, it’s also about helping people mentally, by making them feel happier, too. “I’ve had reviews from customers saying they hadn’t had sex in  years, but one of my toys helped them break through. When I go home after reading comments like that I think, ‘I’ve done my job well today’.” And, like any true professional, Amanda happily practices what she preaches. She said: I enjoy a ied and dynamic sex live with my partner and am never too shy to push a boundary … it makes le exciting, doesn’t harm anyone and certainly increases the bond between us. And yes, I try the products myself. I love trying new toys and have favourites for dferent moods or occasions - whether its for solo play or with my partner. AndIm confident about the product we sell, then it’s a win win situation. Le is short and people should embrace their sexuality. Toys will not hurt or harm, but will bring pleasure and fun. Why have plain, boring old vanilla ice cream, when you could add some exciting sprinkles and turn it into a delicious experience youre unlikely to forget.

The Duchess of Sussex, , was adamant on three specic details she wanted the exquisite gown to feature as she knew her wedding to Prince Harry, , would be watched by the eyes of the world. The Givenchy dress took , hours - equivalent to  days - to make by a team of . And when Meghan walked down the aisle of St Georges Chapel at Windsor Castle on May  she looked every inch the perfect bride.  Pregnant Meghan said designer Clare Waight Keller respected her vision for the dress, from the shape of the neckline to theof the sleeves - and recognised the importance of tailoring as the outfit had to be modest. But Meghan insisted the dress should have a bateau neckline, cropped sleeves, and a timeless feeling. The bridal gown is the star attraction of a new Windsor Castle exhibition about the royal wedding, which includes audio commentary recorded for visitors by the duke and duchess. Touching stories behind the couples big day are revealed, from Harry joking about joining the Queen and Meghan for a meeting to choose a tiara, to how a cold Easter meant there were less flowers to pick for his wes wedding bouquet.  Meghan says in the commentary: I had a very clear vision of what I wanted for the day, and what I wanted the dress to look like, and so what was amazing in working with Clare is that sometimes youll find designers try to push you in a dferent direction. But she just completely respected what I wanted to see for the day, and she wanted to bring that to le for me. So I knew at the onset I wanted a bateau neckline, I wanted a cropped sleeve, I wanted a very timeless, classic feeling and, obviously with respect to the environment we were in and St Georges Chapel, being really modest in what it would look like, I knew that the tailoring was so key, because the dress itself would be so covered up.  Meghan says in the commentary she had followed Clare Waight Kellers career for a long time and she ticked all the boxes from being British, to reflect the duchess new home, and a woman, to working for Givenchy as artistic director, a global fashion house which added an international dimension to the big day. Meghans five-metre long silk tulle veil was also embroidered with flowers from each of the  Commonwealth nations. The dress luminosity is down to the double-bonded silk cady - fabric woven on both sides of the loom - which catches the light. Speaking in the commentary Meghan adds: There was a great level of detail that went into the planning of our wedding day.  I think for us, we knew how large the scale of the event would be, so in making choices that were really personal and meaningful, it could make the whole experience feel intimate, even though it was a very big wedding. On her wedding day, Meghan wore Queen Marys diamond and platinum bandeau tiara, lent to the duchess by the Queen, which is part of the exhibition. The duchess described her visit to the head of state to choose a headpiece as an incredibly surreal day. The duke, who joined Meghan for the visit to the Queen, joked in the commentary: Every girls dream to be able to try on a tiara, and, funnily enough, the one that suited the best, the one that looked the best on you without question, I shouldnt have really even been there, but such an incredible loan by my grandmother, it was very sweet.  The brides bouquet, which featured a number of plants and flowers including sweet peas and sprigs of myrtle, was designed by florist Philippa Craddock and has been recreated using articial silk flowers for the exhibition which opens on Friday. The duke and duchess said cold weather earlier in the year meant there were less flowers available for the wedding bouquet from their cottage garden at Kensington Palace. Meghan revealed they had been doing some planting in the fall and said the duke made a really beautul gesture by picking blooms for her on their wedding day.  Harry added: We didnt have as many flowers in our little garden as we had hoped for because I think it snowed at Easter. That kind of ruined the whole thing. But, theyre very much a bouquet of wild flower, wild flower meadows and making sure that we had forget-me-nots in as it was one of my mothers favourite flowers... The dukes Household Cavalry frockcoat made for the wedding is not available for the exhibition but another identical one owned by Harry has been loaned for the display  Also on display are the wedding outfits worn by pageboy Prince George, a miniature version of Harrys coat, and bridesmaid Princess Charlotte, an ivory silk dress by Clare Waight Keller. Harry joked: We had  bridesmaids, page boys under the age of seven which everybody says is impossible to have them behaving, but they did it. Meghan quipped: It was a miracle.

What was left of it was shredded today when he was named by Peter Hain as the businessman accused of sexual harassment. Lord Hain told peers Green used the courts to stop a newspaper revealing that he had paid large sums to victims of his alleged behaviour. He said non-disclosure deals, which stopped those who signed them speaking out, hid the truth “about serious and repeated sexual harassment, racist abuse and bullying”. He said he named Green because there was a clear public interest. And he is right.  Surely staff have a right to knowtheir boss has bought the silence of previous employees  Surely the public should knowa tycoon, who has worked for the Government, is involved in a litigation battle  This is another example of the rich and powerful using money to hide their secrets. Such expensive legal protection is rarely on offer to survivors of sex abuse and harassment. Green kept his knighthood despite his role in the fall of BHS that cost , jobs. If these allegations are right, he should lose his honour.  He set the tone Donald Trump refuses to accept that with office comes responsibility. Senior Democrats and their supporters have been targeted in a wave of bomb attacks. The President might have chosen this moment to reflect on whether his coarse style of politics had incited this terrorist action.  Instead he blamed his opponents and the media for stoking anger in the country. This is a man who called Hillary Clinton a crook and reporters enemies of the people, who mocked the disabled and failed to condemn white supremacists. America takes its lead from the President and he is steering America into a dark place. Pie in the spy The Government’s listening agency GCHQ is getting its own Greggs.

Pearl, aged  months, died after the brick wall hit by the Range Rover collapsed on top of her as she walked to the park with her father and baby brother. Lorry driver Andrew Williams, , had been driving his Range Rover before leaving it on a steep driveway. But an inquest yesterday heard Mr Williams did not fully apply handbrake - and the automatic vehicle was not left in park.  Pearls devastated parents Paul and Gemma Black spoke out after coroner Andrew Barkley ruled Pearls death was accidental. Paul, , said that due to a legal loophole in the law Mr Williams could not be prosecuted. But a CPS spokesman has now stated that the decision not to charge Mr Williams came following a thorough review.  The spokesman said: The CPS carried out a thorough review of the evidence and concluded the case failed to meet the evidential test for prosecution. We have explained the reasons behind this decision to Pearls family and our thoughts remain with them. After the inquest Mr Black said he would walk to London to get a bill passed to change the law. He said: The vehicle was mechanically sound. It would not have movedit had been properly secured. Yet a simple loophole of law – that it started its descent on private rather than public land – has stopped us getting justice for our daughter. We shouldn’t be here at the coroner’s court today. We should have been given the justice we deserve at criminal court instead, the law as it stands has prevented any repercussions for what was not a fluke accident and could have been completely avoided had the handbrake been fully applied and the automatic transmission correctly placed in park. This is why we are now calling on the Government to change the law so that no other family has to suffer as we have.  The inquest, in Pontypridd, heard Pearl was with her singer father Paul and her eight-month-old brother Acer when the tragedy happened in August . Mr Black screamed: Shes gone. The wall has crushed her, after the Range Rover ploughed into it in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales. Tests were carried out on the .-tonne Range Rover after it was recovered from the scene. Investigators found the handbrake of the x had been only been applied two notches - out of a possible six.  The gear lever was between park and reverse. Coroner Andrew Barkley gave a conclusion of accidental death. He said: “Mr Williams said he assumed the gear lever was in park. As far as the application of the brake is concerned, he did not count the number of clicks. Sadly, as we know, that was insufficient. It seems the issue here was very much driver operation.” "},{"url":null,"title":"young boy left devastating scars","story":"NewsYoung boy left with devastating scars after being set alight by firework shares heartbreaking messageBrave Ben McCabe, , from Glasgow, now copes with the annual event by pretending its just another dayShareCommentsBySarah WardAmber Hicks:,  OCT NewsBen and mum Amy \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA young boy left with devastating scars after being set alight by a stray firework still dreads Bonfire Night seven years after his horric ordeal. Ben McCabe, , who needs treatment every day for his burns, has shared a heartbreaking warning ahead of the popular annual event. He urged: I want people to think about the consequences of setting off these fireworks and how easy it is for something to go wrong - when you dont know what to do. Ben was just four years old when he was left screaming in agony as the firework came hurtling towards him and set his shirt on fire.  He had been watching the pyrotechnics with dad Alan in the suburban cul-de-sac where they live in Glasgow, on November , . After being struck by the firework, Bens dad rushed him into the house and put him in a cold bath, calling we Amy to tell her what had happened. Ben then spent three weeks in hospital and was left with third degree burns and needing skin grafts across his chest and neck. The brave schoolboy says he now copes with the annual event by pretending its just another day.  Last bonfire night I managed to make it to the door to look outside but Im still very scared of them, he said. I usually sit in my room and pretend its just another day. Mum Amy, , who had just clocked onto a sht as a nurse at Glasgows Royal Hospital for Sick Children, recalled the terrying incident. She said: The firework headed straight for Ben and went into his shirt which then caught alight.  He was screaming so loud and no one could believe what had just happened. Alan put him into a cold bath until the ambulance came - there was nothing left of his shirt. Amy ran down the hospital corridor to the AE department to meet the ambulance and spent the next three weeks by Bens bedside. As a parent it was killing me inside seeing him like that. I had to try and keep calm for the family - and for Ben, she said.  He was in hospital for  days and still needs skin grafts and massages four times a day to keep the skins elasticity and that can be really hard going. I am so very proud of my son - he is so much braver than me, and anyone I know. But after the initial horror of the accident and the subsequent medical treatment, the family had to live with the prospect that Ben would be scarred for le - and deal with how it would affect his confidence.  Amy, who now works as a dental technician, said: I was worried about what people would say when they saw his scars and how he would react. There was an incident at the swimming pool when he had his pressure garment on and some boys were staring at him and shouting stuff to him. I was looking around for their parents and at the same time worrying what this would do to Ben. He came over to me and said Mum can you take the garment off - so I did.  He put his chin up and walked past these boys bearing his scars with this presence that made my heart skip a beat of pride. He is so much braver than me. The family found support from The Scottish Burned Childrens Club, and Amy said: Ben is so much more confident and determined and wants to help others. He has an amazing network of friends through the club and I cant describe how much it has helped him.  For myself it has been a Godsend to meet other families with similar stories - to know you are not on your own and that you are actually doing OK. Its like a new family and a forever connection that no one  can understand. You cant buy the support. Deputy Assistant Chief Officer for Prevention and Protection John Miller said: Bonfire Night is typically the services busiest night of the year.  We are appealing to the public to attend organised events rather than do-it-yourself bonfires and fireworks displays. Our firefighters work extremely hard to engage with people of all ages and equip them with the knowledge and the awareness of how to stay safe around bonfires and fireworks.

Mexico-based Thomas Markle, , is said to be desperate to reconcile with Meghan, , before she gives birth so that he can visit his grandchild. Royal sources claim he has spoken of his “rights” and how the tot will be part of his family too, having “Markle blood” as well as “blue blood”. Thomas has made more approaches to Kensington Palace and even appealed to Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who married Prince Harry and Meghan, for help. And sources say his anger at being cut out of his daughter’s le is such that he may even hire a legal team to force visits through the courts.  A source said: “The palace is acutely aware of what problems could lie ahead with Thomas. He strongly believes the baby should be as much a part of his le as they will be Prince Charles’s. “Thomas says the Markle blood will be as much in the child’s veins as the ‘blue blood’ of the royals and he has ‘rights’. He admits mistakes but with Meghan pregnant, he is desperate to heal the rt. Thomas has reached out to Kensington Palace more so since news of Meghan’s pregnancy broke, hoping the baby will be what finally breaks their estrangement.” He has offered to fly to the UKhe can sit down with Meghan and Harry, , when theyfrom their royal tour of Australia. His push comes as Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, may be poised to move from Los Angeles to be nearer during the pregnancy. Thomas learned Meghan was expecting when he heard it on his car radio.  He said: “The first thing I thought about was holding Meghan as a newborn. I thought, ‘My baby is having a baby’. A baby is a blessing and I look forward to seeing a little Meghan or a little Harry.” Friends of the retired film lighting technician claim he would even like the baby to be called ThomasMeghan has a boy. His only son is also called Thomas.  Meghan has not spoken to her dad since her wedding in May. Thomas failed to attend after being declared too unwell to travel following heart palpitations. The illness came after he was exposed for staging pictures with paparazzi in the run-up – which he lied to Harry about.

Body modication fanatic Paulina Casillas Landeros, from Jalisco, Mexico, underwent numerous surgeries such as a back corset - which involves piercings on either side of the spine - and a split tongue. She later decided to remove her belly button as it is what makes us human before giving it as a present to her then boyfriend Daniel Ramirez, in . But following the removal three years ago, she says she ultimately regrets her decision describing it as reckless and impulsive.  The HR intern and tourism student said: I have always had problems with my family, I was not very close to them at the time. Body modications fascinated me, there is something very transcending about them. I was very angry, I wanted to cut all unions from everything and everyone. I wanted to dehumanise myself in a symbolic way, I wanted to do something controversial. I underwent an operation done by a professional but he gave me very bad advice on how to take care of the trauma so it got infected. I was suffering, I spent days in bed asI were quarantined, I couldn’t stretch, push, stand up or laugh. It gradually healed itself but not  per cent - it will never close entirely.  Paulina said she knew she wanted to give the body part to Daniel as an ultimate token of love. She said: I was very much in love with my then boyfriend, he supported me through many dficult times, and he is one of the most influential people in my le. It was something I did in the spur of the moment, we were young and stupid but that’s the way I felt. I put it in a small bag along with a note saying I love you, it was very emotional. He has kept it and he will keep it forever because he knows the meaning behind it. We are good friends now but we will always love each other.  Paulina says her relationship with her family has now improved. I do regret it when I put myself in my mum’s position, it must have been devastating for her, she was so sad, she said. I can’t imagine how it must feel, your own child wanting to break all their connection to you. If I could go back in time, I wouldn’t do it again, it was impulsive, reckless and I hurt a lot of people. Even though I did it for the wrong reasons, it has now taught me I should think things through before acting and it’s a nice reminder that characterises me.

The couple attended a welcome reception and dinner in Tonga where she looked stunning in a white dress. The dress had capped sleeves and showed off her arms, which looked really shiny like they were slightly damp. Upon inspection, the Duchess is evidently wearing insect repellent on her skin to protect herself from mosquitos - and its for a very good reason.  Meghan is taking smart precautions against the Zika virus, which there is a reasonable risk of contracting in Tonga and Fiji. The Duchess is being mindful by applying repellent and generally wearing long-sleeved clothing to fend off the insects. Dr Preethi Daniel, the Clinical Director at London Doctors Clinic, said to Hello magazine: The Duchess of Sussex would, of course, have taken the appropriate advice prior to travel but there are several simple things she can do to protect herself. While she must look glamorous and politically appropriate at all official engagements, avoiding mosquito bites means she should stick to indoor events between dawn and dusk.  The doctor recommended Deet as a repellent in tropical regions, as well as wearing loose clothing the mosquitos cant bite through. Sleeping in air-conditioned rooms is advisable, but of course, this is the Duchess we are speaking of, Dr Daniel added. Meghan has avoided going to areas where shes at higher risk of getting the Zika virus, which can cause serious birth defects, including microcephaly. For example, she did not attend the Colo-i-Suva forest site or the Fiji War Memorial in Suva The World Health Organization classied Tonga in March as a Category  risk area for the virus.

The annual gathering, which was hosted at the Grand Ballroom at the Shangri-La Hotel, recognises feats of excellence in adventure, science and conservation. The royals presented awards to young people who have made considerable contributions to the field and both gave an address to attendees. The Queen was given a special environmental award by the Society for the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy, a worldwide campaign to boost forest conservation.Harry accepted the award on her behalf and paid a touching tribute to his father, the Prince of Wales.  He said: There was a time, when as human beings we thought the world belonged to us.Now we are beginning to realise that we actually belong to the world. We are responsible to it, and to each other. My father and others have been speaking about the environment for decades - not basing it on fallacy or new-age hypothesis, but rooted in science and facts, and the sobering awareness of our environmental vulnerability.And while those speeches would sometimes fall on deaf ears, he and others were unrelenting in their commitment to preserve the most valuable resource we have – our planet, he said. Harry and Meghan were involved in a mid-air scare earlier today when their Qantas plane was forced to abort a landing as it approached Sydney Airport.  Harry, , and pregnant Meghan, , were pictured smiling as they walked off the plane and left in a car after flying to Sydney from Tonga. Captain Nigel Rosser described the incident as a “missed approach” over the tannoy because there was another jet on the runway which was too slow to move. The royal couple were in business class and the their royal team and travelling press corps on board too when it was decided to scrap the landing on safety grounds.Captain Rosser of Qantas special charter flight QF from Tonga to Sydney announced, “Unfortunately there was on aircraft that was a little bit close too slow to roll.  “The decision was decided to abort the landing,” he said. Mirror photographer Ian Vogler, who was on the plane said: We were coming down to land, having come in via Sydney Harbour, just seconds off actually hitting the runway, when the pilot had to pull the plane back up and we were rising again. There were a few nervous flyers on board so it must have been concerning for them but it was all handled very well by the pilots on board.  Earlier in the tour, Harry praised the conservation work of Tonga in its efforts to combat deforestation. Speaking at Tupou College, the duke said: “Tonga is leading by example and understands deeply the impact of environmental changes because they directly affect these islands. “Planting trees and conserving forests helps us in so many ways. The Duchess of Sussex skipped a trip to the rainforest for a second time due to the threat of the Zika virus.  Instead, schoolchildren performed a special dance to ward off mosquitoes and keep the mum-to-be safe, to the delight and laughter of the royal couple.

I enclose a list of the names we received – some chose to remain anonymous.“We feel this sends a strong message to your company that this proposed rise should not take place.“It is also our understanding that the Scottish Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman, is writing to you to ask for a rethink.“The will of the general public and our country’s top politicians is clear – a rise in parking fees at Ninewells Hospital should not go ahead on November .“We urge you to take these views into consideration and do the right thing by the people the hospital serves – and Freeze the Fees for the coming year.”Ms Freeman’s letter, sent to Indigo managing director Phillip Herring, read: “As you will be aware, the Scottish Government abolished car parking charges at all publicly-owned NHS hospital car parks from December  .“Hospital car parking charges put an unnecessary financial burden on those attending hospital for treatment, their families and hospital staff.“Increases of any size add to this burden and I therefore urge you to reconsider the decision to increase car parking charges at Ninewells Hospital and to commit to freezing parking charges at existing levels, as set in November .”Indigo has refused to answer questions from the Tele on its plans, but claims the fees are governed by its contract with NHS Tayside."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bcee1f8093d1-e1540285944998-785x564.jpg ","title":"george cran roles reversed as pressure now on dunfermline and allan johnston as dundee united look to gather momentum","story":"With the first quarter of the season behind them, it’s fair to say it’s been a bumpy ride so far for Dundee United.Often coaches will use this point of the campaign as the first real chance to assess how things are going as they prepare to meet sides for the second time in the league.For the Tangerines, though, a report card right now can’t possibly tell the whole story with Csaba Laszlo not even lasting to this marker in charge of the team.And to judge his replacement Robbie Neilson after just two matches in charge wouldn’t be fair.However, comparing the fortunes of their next opponents Dunfermline since they met on the opening league match of the season makes for interesting reading.That’s because the atmosphere around Allan Johnston’s Pars since they finally overturned a -match winless run against the Tangerines to continue a lightning-fast start to the campaign has flipped almost completely.While the Tangerines struggled and stumbled under Csaba’s reign at the start of the season, Johnston was enjoying seeing his side inflict a - win at Tannadice to make it five wins from five games played after a % record in their Betfred Cup group.That was with an impressive  goals scored and included a deserved - win at Premiership Dundee.Now, though, Johnston faces a new man in the other dugout with intense scrutiny from fans now on him rather than his opposite number.After their perfect start to the campaign, it took Dunfermline another five matches to register a second victory in the Championship and have only racked up eight points from eight matches since.In the process they only managed six goals, conceding  and being dumped out of both the League Cup and Irn-Bru Cup on penalty shoot-outs.Going into Saturday’s game at East End Park, the Pars sit adrt of the play-off places, four points behind United in fourth place.Another poor result, after their - home defeat to Queen of the South at the weekend, will leave them well behind in the race for the top four, heaping all the pressure on Johnston and his side.And the contrast with Neilson, his United players and the atmosphere among the support is stark.After kicking off his reign with a - victory at Partick Thistle, the new gaffer led the Tangerines out for the first time at Tannadice at the weekend.Despite not managing to make it two wins from two, drawing - with Inverness CT, the players were boosted by the biggest home crowd of the campaign.The belief that Neilson can repeat the feat of promotion to the Premiership he achieved at Hearts is clear among the United support.Optimism throughout the stands has been almost completely absent over the past couple of seasons but the hope is now with former chairman Stephen Thompson having departed, and Neilson taking the reigns, good times might be on the horizon.And the ideal time to fuel that fire is now with games against sides below them in the table coming up – Dunfermline this weekend and then Queens the week after.With both the sides coming up in indferent form, points are a must to keep the good feeling flowing.Because what Dunfermline did show the last time the teams met, despite what’s happened since, is they can actually beat their bogey side United.What Neilson can’t afford now is to let the early momentum slip away, something that happened with both Ray McKinnon and, more obviously, Csaba Laszlo.Preventing that could well show the fans’ early optimism is justied come the season end."},{"url":null,"title":"jim mcintyre expected to make first dundee signing ahead of celtic clash","story":"Dundee boss Jim McIntyre is swtly set to bolster his options by adding free agent Martin Woods to his squad.The former Ross County midfielder has been without a club since leaving Partick Thistle after their relegation last season and is set to be re-united with his former gaffer.McIntyre signed Woods twice while gaffer in Dingwall, the first a month after taking charge before the -year-old had a spell down south with Shrewsbury before ing north.Woods has been training with the Dark Blues since last week and was present at last night’s -

On accepting the two-match suspension, the club, in my opinion, are accepting the player committed the act, solely to deceive the referee.”However, that has enraged Kilmarnock, who released a

step closer to creating a pound. million regional tennis centre despite some strong opposition.Last Thursday, the care, learning and housing committee voted overwhelmingly in favour of proceeding with an applicationto the next funding round on November .The project is backed by Sport Scotland, Tennis Scotland and the Lawn Tennis Association with proposals that would see funding come from a grant of up to pound million from the Transforming Scottish Indoor Tennis Fund .However, this falls short of the total needed and will leave the council and High Le Highland, the charity which provides leisure services across the region, to source a further half a million pounds.Councillor Andrew Jarvie tabled an amendment opposing the move saying he was \"annoyed\" because he felt the priority should have been replacing \"past it\" mobile librariesthat would better serve the whole region.Mr Jarvie said: \"I just struggle to connect the dots at a time when we struggle to protect the services that we do have ndash how are we then going on and investing in new services  It seems not the right way to do it.\"He added the \"Inverness-centric project\" would be of benefit to the \"inner Moray Firth area

business case, how much it would cost to run and how much it would generate. This proposal is back to front.\"Despite the objections there was enough support within the committee to push the bid forward to the application stage with a future review to be undertaken on the business case.Brigitte Johnson, whose daughter plays tennis, attended the council in support of the move along with five others.She said: \"Currently the issue in Highland is that we donrsquot have any indoor facilities, so kids, adults, anyone who wants to get involved have to travel down the A to Stirling or Gleneagles ndash a long way to go for a game of tennis.\"Ross Lyon , an S pupil at Fortrose Academy and an avid tennis player believes an indoor facility would greatly benefit young people in the north.He said: \"Most tournaments in the winter are indoors down south so having indoor courts up here will allow me to improve and also give me a chance to play all year round which means that I wouldnrsquot fall behind others from the central belt.\"It would help young kids get into the sport who donrsquot want to play in negative one degrees on a sodden Tuesday night.\"Friday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118067.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to proper gent 92","story":" A SON has paid tribute to his -year-old father who died following a two-car collision in Inverness.Bill MacKenzie , of Firthview Drive, Scorguie, died when his car was involved in a collision with a van in Carse Road on October .Son Donald MacKenziedescribed his father, a former church officer at St Columba High Church, as \"an outgoing man who was well known in the city\" having lived and worked in Inverness throughout his le.\"My dad always very dapper and always wore a jacket and tie,\" he said. \"He was always a very healthy and independent person.\"When he was  he needed a walking stick because he had a bad back.

As it stands, maternity leave begins when the child is born.Hazel got the inspiration for her campaign after her son Logan was born seven weeks early and spent time in the neonatal unit at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital.Hazel and her husband David, both , were allowed to take him home two weeks later, but it got her thinking about other families, who can spend months in the hospital.Hazel, who works as an in-house legal counsel, said: “While we were in the neonatal unit we met so many other families – some with babies much more premature or sick than Logan. As you can imagine, it was a very stressful and emotional environment.“We were not expecting our baby to arrive so early and were really just going through the motions in hospital.“Nobody plans on having their baby in the neonatal unit, and I can tell you it’s stressful enough without having the additional worry about wages and the pressure put on partners having to make dficult decisions over whether to exhaust their paternity leave or annual leave holidays,they have any, or beg for compassionate leave before their babies are even home.“Personally I believe any time spent for either parent in a neonatal unit with premature babies should be paid and it should not impact either parent’s entitlement to leave.“The mother should still have her full entitlement when she gets home, as should the partner.”Luckily for Hazel and David, from Bridge of Don, Logan is now happy and healthy, but they are aware that this isn’t the case for everyone, and the maternity and paternity leave rules can make an already stressful situation worse.Hazel hopes the Scottish Government will consider extra leave for families who have a premature baby.She added: “My petition is aimed at premature babies, but as others have highlighted, this is also an issue faced by parents of sick babies. The introduction of paternity leave and shared parental leave is great but this is still an area the UK could improve upon.”A Scottish Government spokesman said: “Ensuring parents are well supported during the early stages of family le is also key to improving outcomes for all our children.“We believe everyone should have access to reasonable support from employers when they become parents.“Although the relevant legal powers are currently reserved to Westminster, we are committed to promoting and supporting flexible working, particularly for parents whose babies are born prematurely or require additional support.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dons stadium hearing delayed by six weeks","story":"A key legal hearing about Aberdeen FC’s proposed new stadium has been delayed by almost six weeks.Aberdeen City Council has given the Dons permission to build a ,-capacity stadium and training ground at Kingsford but protest group No to Kingsford Stadiumhas challenged it by petitioning for a judicial review.A procedural hearing was to be held on November , but that has been pushed back to December .It means the substantive hearing, which was to begin on December , will now start on January .The outcome will not be known for three months after that hearing.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

So many of our players have had really big matches for their clubs in the lead up to the international but they are done now and our total focus is on Ireland this Saturday.#The spine of the squad is from Newtonmore and that should not be any surprise given they have just won the treble.#There are a few Argyll representatives aside from the team captain. Irvine#s Kyles team-mate Roddy MacDonald has also been selected and there are places for Oban Camanachd duo Lorne Dickie and Andrew MacCuish.The Scottish mantra in recent games has been to keep the ball on the ground and to use the wide open spaces to stretch the Irish defence and not allow the hurlers to build up a head of steam with their aerial game.Caberfeidh’s dead-ball expert Kevin Bartlett will again be key and he scored twelve of Scotland’s eighteen points a year ago.There are no rule changes as such this year but there will be an Irish referee, John Keane, which brings its own dimension.Garry Reid added: #The interpretation of the rules will be key. In general, Irish referees tend to let more go and there may be more of a tendency to get away with hands on the back and perhaps more pulling and shoving.#We’ll just need to be careful and concentrate on our game. However there’s no doubt this will make for a fast pace as it will let the game flow and that’s important for the international to remain a spectacle for the supporters.#Scotland squad:Stuart MacDonald Glen MacKintosh The match, which starts at pm, will not be broadcast live this year but the match will be shown in full on BBC ALBA from pm on Saturday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mum gets ready for a new year dooking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowShe hates the water and is none too fond of the cold, but one Mid Argyll mother plans to throw herself into the icy sea on New Year#s Day.Joan Williamson is taking part in the traditional Loony Dook at South Queensferry for a cause close to her heart.When her twin daughters Star and Angel were born two months premature at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary after an emergency Caesarean section, mum and babies were in a bad way.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13470760.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_AMP_SDR_150718_TRUMP0013JPG.jpg","title":"ayrshire dad who blocked president","story":"NewsDaft dad in the dock after blocking Donald Trumps motorcade while he popped into the Co-op for milkPeter Goudie was stunned to be confronted with armed cops when he came out of the Maybole supermarket with his shopping.ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsPeter Goudie came face-to-face with armed cops when he held up the Trump motorcade when he popped into the Co-op for milk \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHe had dashed out to buy some milk from the Co-op.

Donald Trump had already touched down at Prestwick in Air Force One and his cavalcade was heading to Maybole, en route to a weekend of golf and talks at Turnberry. And the convoy of the most powerful president on earth wasn’t going to be impeded by a naughty parker. The astonishing tale unfolded at Ayr Justice of the Peace Court last week. Goudie’s lawyer Peter Lockhart just managed to keep his client on the road, and he left with eight penalty points on his driving licence and a pound fine. Goudie, of The Loaning, Maybole, admitted stopping on a zig-zag line at a pelican crossing, having no insurance, taking his we’s car without permission and not having a full licence.  Depute fiscal Ed Sheeran told the Justice on the bench that at around pm on Friday, July  there was a major police operation on-going on the A. He said that it was part of a management plan due to the visit of the president of the United States of America. The court was told that there was a large police presence in Maybole High Street and that they had noticed the grey Golf was stopped on the zig-zags. They found Goudie inside the shop and the offences unfolded.  Mr Lockhart told the court Goudie’s we was out and he had decided to pop down to the Co-op to get some milk. The solictior added: “My client had not noticed the high police presence. “He was alarmed when he was approached by the police in the shop and even more alarmed when he came out and saw more police, including armed police in the vicinity.” Mr Lockhart explained that it had been a costly exercise as the police had removed and impounded his car. He added: “His we was furious when she found out as it cost pound to get the car back the following day. “He was in the dog house for his stupidity.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEd SheeranVolkswagenJusticePrestwickDonald TrumpAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire vets reveal cases sedated","story":"NewsAyrshire vets reveal cases of \"sedated\" and \"drowsy\" dogs on our beachesWidespread reports of dogs falling ill have sparked panic among pet owners in the region.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsAyr beach \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailVets have been inundated with sick dogs on Ayrshires coastline, the Post can reveal.

children they can have.\"Universal Credit may have its flaws, but the thinking behind the system is sound.\"It is about making it better to be in work than not to be in work.\"MSPs were debating

The rampant home side completely outplayed the visitors who looked out of sorts and overwhelmed by the occasion.For those who witnessed the second half, what followed was one of the finest and most unlikely comebacks they will ever experience.Claremont blitzed the unsuspecting Pupils from the outset, scoring in their first attack of the match.Before a breath was drawn, a surging run and cross by Claremont’s tall centre-forward was promptly dispatched into the back of the net at the back post.It was a case of backs to the wall for the visitors who, after a number of close shaves, found themselves two behind midway through the first half.This time the damage was self-inflicted, when an innocuous cross from the left was palmed into the path of the incoming striker who scored with ease from close range.The alarm bells now ringing loudly, with  minutes of the half remaining the visitors somehow conjured a goal against the run of play.A breakout by Ryan Deans ended with a fine pass to set up Sary Rhama, whose pace and parting shot almost took the net away.The home side, however, were unrelenting in their efforts and deservedly restored a two-goal cushion with a goal just before the break.A reading of the riot act at half time appeared to have the desired effect as, after a number of changes, both positional and to personnel, the second period produced a whole new ball game.Leading the line from the front, the introduction of Cameron Wylie was the key to the comeback, his unrelenting efforts to close space soon rewarded as his team responded in kind.A quick interchange of passes between Deans and Grumoli brought its reward, leaving the latter free to curl a wonderful shot into the top corner of the net. The comeback was on.Liam Renton joined the act in the th minute of a strange match after a headed clearance met with a flush volley as a superbly struck shot thundered into the net for the equaliser.There was time aplenty for the Pupils to shoot themselves in the foot again, and Claremont regained the initiative when Fraser Wylie mistimed a clearance to send the ball into his own net.At the opposite end – possibly goal of the match.Astothe gesture, a deep free kick from Renton produced another equaliser, the home defence’s attempted clearance rebounding off a fellow team mate and into the net.So came the final moments of the game, with Cameron Wylie again involved.A crunching challenge on Wylie seemed to be an obvious free kick, but the referee waved play on.Gary Grumoli sent an inch perfect pass to the back post, for Ross Brown to score his first team goal and the Pupils# eventual, but by now, deserved winner.In a clf-hanging finish to a game that had everything, Alastair Ferguson produced a wonderful one-handed save to deflect a perfectly struck free kick to safety.Campbeltown Pupils are at home tomorrow with a pm kick off against second-placed Neilston.See posters and social media for further information.A previous celebration for Gary Grumoli and Liam Renton two stars of Saturday#s match. _cpupils_celebration"},{"url":null,"title":"giant-sponge-of-mosses-tackling-air-pollution-in-musselburgh","story":"Air pollution in the centre of the Honest Toun has long been a cause for concern.Now, a giant sponge of mosses has been put in place on High Street, outside the police station, in the hope of cutting nearby pollution by close to a third.CityTree has been developed by German green technology firm Green City Solutions who say the combination of mosses in the structure can filter air pollutants - including nitrogen dioxide - from the surrounding air by up to  per cent.Derek Oliver of East Lothian Council described the structure as a \"innovative approach\"to tackling air quality issues.He added: \"It is anticipated to raise awareness and influence behavioural change around pollution and climate change.

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much.

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus. It should not just parallel other bus routes, which is what the Tesco bus does, but should serve some of the residential areas that are cut off from buses. Goose Green is another area remote from a bus route.A Tesco spokesperson said: ldquoWe have made the dficult decision to stop the provision of the T and T bus services to and from our Musselburgh Extra store.ldquoUnfortunately the services make a loss, which means we are no longer able to provide them.ldquoWe have worked with local bus providers to ensure that all affected areas will continue to have a bus link that connects them to our store, including a newly introduced  bus from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird.ldquoOur priority now is to ensure our customers who use the bus are aware of our decision and of all these alternative routes so that they are able to plan their journeys.ldquoWe apologise for any inconvenience this causes.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoEast Lothian Council was notied of Tescorsquos intention to withdraw the T and T services in September and we are fully aware of the impact this may have on the local community. We actively engaged with local providers and Prentice coaches are implementing changes to the  service, which will start on October  from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird via the Tesco turning area and will now mirror the times of the T T to allow connection from other services.ldquoOperators looked at the T  service the general conclusion was that a straight like-for-like service was not commercially viable due to the numbers using the service.ldquoThe council is not licensed to operate the running of service work and our own fleet is at full capacity however, we will continue to discuss options, which will include community buses as a way to support residents who are affected.Ross Prentice, managing director of Prentice Coaches Ltd, said: ldquoWe are starting a new bus service, the , on Monday. It will run from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird via Port Seton and Prestonpans.ldquoOnce it gets to The Loan in Wallyford it will replace the Tesco T bus by going down Macbeth Moir Road and Pinkie Road, then into Tesco before continuing to Fort Kinnaird.We will evaluate passenger use after a few weeks and hope to be able to expand the route in the new year.ldquoWe also currently run two routes into Tesco, the  and , and, from October , the  will make that three routes which will give a pretty good coverage of the Musselburgh area to and from the store.Iain Clark, chairman of Musselburgh Area Partnership, said: ldquoThe area partnership has recently been presented with the findings of our lsquowhat matters to yoursquo questionnaire, which highlights a number of areas that would make a dference to the daily live of the senior members of our community.

This is one of more than  local networks set up by UN Global Compact around the world to help translate Sustainable Development Goals into business action and innovation.ldquoThe Scottish SDGs Reporting Working Group is focusing on two key challenges, Preston says. ldquoFirstly, how can businesses seize the opportunities of Sustainable Development Goals by building them into their business models and also benefit the Scottish economy, environment and most importantly, our people  ldquoSecondly, how can the Scottish approach to One Planet Prosperity and Sustainable Development Goals create transformational impact across the UK and globally These are big ambitions. So the vision is to translate the global helicopter view of Sustainable Development Goals into practical hands-on tools andapproaches that can be used in the day-to-day work of businesses ndash with benefit for them, their local communities and the environment.There are already great examples in Scotland of Sustainable Development Goals in action. For example, Scottish Water and SEPA have signed a Sustainable Growth Agreement focused on finding new ways to recover more resources from the wastes it manages and generates. It aims to contribute to ten of the Sustainable DevelopmentGoals. On the Isle of Lewis, the Outer Hebrides Local Energy Hub is an innovative partnership project between Comhairle nan Eilean Siar , Community Energy Scotland, Pure Energy Centre and The Scottish Salmon Company demonstrating how dferent renewable energy technologies can be integrated to support local energy economiesand circular supply chains.In the retail industry, brands including Aldi, Asda, Ikea, Boots and Next have signed up to the British Retail Consortiumrsquos Better Retail Better World initiative, which sets out a range of targets in line with Sustainable Development Goals. There are many more examples ndash and the hope is that businesses will share ideas and experiences through the new Scottish SDGs Reporting Working Group.ldquoThe group will run for  months, with the aim of delivering a suite of practical tools and approaches by st April  ndash World Creativity and Innovation Day, Preston explains. ldquoWersquoll do this through themed events and building partnerships, with an initial focus on strategy and reporting to create a consistent approach for everyone.Then wersquoll look at dferent lsquoScotlandrsquos businesses have a critical role to play in leading our contribution to achieving Sustainable Development Goals approaches based on dferent types and sizes of organisations, because a global financial institution might take a dferent approach to a small business or a non-governmental organisation. The last stage will involve pulling together our learnings and experience into a package of tools, simple guidance and case studies for promoting more widely to businesses.SEPArsquos One Planet Prosperity strategy reflects that society is currently using the resources of three planets, and needs to live within its means. ICAS also promotes best practice amongst its members on environmentalsustainability and related corporate social responsibility issues.This includes the importance of building sustainability measures into the reporting of company accounts, to help drive decision-making in this area.ldquoICAS and SEPA could have steered this initiative on their own, but something much bigger and better will be delivered through businesses driving the working group and collaborating to develop shared ideas and action, Preston concludes.Organisations interested in helping to shape the future of sustainable development goal action and reporting, can contact Catherine Preston, SEPArsquoshead of innovation.The Heraldrsquos Climate for Change initiative supports efforts being made by the Scottish Government with key organisations and campaign partners.

[The Scottish Government] will review the current situation and consider whether changes to the law are required.A government statement was released saying similar, adding that responsible and appropriate culling of animals is a necessary part of sustainable land management. However, ldquoThe Environmental Secretary will review the situation and consider whether any clarications or changes to the law might be required.We are still in grouse hunting season, a popular pastime of the royal family while in Scotland. In fact, the public was treated in August this year to the news that Prince George, five, was reportedly taken on his first grouse shoot by his parents on the Balmoral estate.Prince William has made animal conservation his pet - pardon the pun - cause, flying around the world to preach against hunting endangered species.And yet hersquos well aware of the thrill of the hunt himself.Letrsquos not forget Prince Harry posing with a one tonne water buffalo he felled with a rle while on a gap year in Africa.Though the Duke of Essex missed this years royal shooting day out, reportedly due to the influence of his new we, a keen animal lover.So why are goats more sympathetic than grouse  One of the complaints detailed in the online petition calling for action is that \"Ms Switlyk has used her photos to advertise hunting experience tours to an American and international audience.\"Swaggering on social media about ones kill isnt the done thing. The rich and the royals fell stags and shoot grouse but they do it discreetly.Some are shocked that tourists would travel to Scotland for bloodsports but bloodsports are part of the le of the country.The argument for hunting trips is, as the Scottish Government statement points out, that estate management involves the culling of animal species to prevent overpopulation. The goats are not native to Islay and they have no natural predators to control their numbers. Previously contraceptive darts have been used to prevent them breeding.Im sure Ms Switlyk - who has now received death threats online herself - would argue that shes doing her bit for conservation.Scottish Greens MSP Mark Ruskell, urged the Scottish government to \"make it known that bloodsport participants are unwelcome to visit Scotland for the barbaric practice\". Who wants to be the one to tell the Queen Now that goats have united the political ide,we really want to have a conversation about hobby hunting in Scotland, it would be sensible to consider all creatures great and small rather than act on a hair-trigger response to sights we find distasteful."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mp-signed-non-disclosure-agreement-after-being-bullied-at-work","story":"Hannah Bardell, the partyrsquos culture spokeswoman, said she was put in a ldquovery dficult position by an employer shortly before she entered politics.It came amid ongoing controversy over the use of NDAs, which some claim are being used by the wealthy to cover up allegations of bullying or harassment.Ms Bardell, who worked in the oil and gas industry before becoming an MP, spoke out after being asked about the issue on the BBCrsquos Question Time.She said: \"Its something Ive never spoken about, but given Ive got a voice I feel I should use it.

They have been addressed.A Whitbread spokesman said yesterday that the company is working with Highland Council to ensure \"all the relevant data and supporting information\" is made available.\"We understand the application will go before the planning committee in November,\" he said.The proposed hotel has attracted  representations from the public ndash both in favour and against.Local hoteliers and other accommodation providers claim a Premier Inn would affect trade and result in local job losses, while supporters say it would boost tourism and greatly improve the site which has been described as an eyesore.Earlier this year, Caithness Chamber of Commerce warned that the project would have \"a signicant negative impact\" on other businesses and the town centre.But retired local businessman Andy Bruce, who ran Far North Aviation at Wick airport for  years, supports the proposed development at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Caithness is \"screaming out\" for more hotel accommodation, he said.Mike Potts, chairman of Thurso Community Council, also backed the plan. \"It will utilise the site properly, provide further amenities and will tidy up an area which desperately needs it,\" he said.\"I know theres opposition from other hoteliers and accommodation providers but Premier offers a very basic service which is cost-effective and would be accessible by rail.\"However, Mr Potts said the hotel plan could \"compound the existing traffic problem\" in that part of Thurso and says planners should address this.Whitbread has applied for a three-storey hotel with landscaping and car parking.If approved, it would be the most northerly Premier Inn in the UK.The development would represent a multimillion-pound investment and create around  jobs.The site was owned by Tesco, which planned to build a new supermarket, but the project was later scrapped.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Friday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmOrkney Youth Café staff and users are delighted to announce that they have successfully secured funding which will keep the Café open for the next three years. £, has been awarded from Children in Need, and will fund staff, activity and running costs.

It is a neurological disease which results in changes in animals# mental state, abnormalities of posture and movement and of sensation. The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority.

This is not some dry, academic debate. The potential health consequences of ministers failing to heed the advice of their own experts are serious.“I hope the Health Secretary will use her influence, therefore, to persuade her colleague, the Housing Minister, to accept the case for using a Rural Minimum Income Standard to help define fuel poverty in rural and island areas.  This is the only way of ensuring those who need help get the support they need.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes. Tickets for the concert will be released on Monday, October , and will be available at the council’s customer services points in School Place, Kirkwall, and Warehouse Buildings, Stromness.At .pm, a lone bugler at St Magnus Cathedral will join , inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic ‘Last Post’.This will be followed by the lighting of a beacon on the St Magnus Cathedral kirk green at pm as part of the national Beacons of Light event which will see beacons lit across the country, symbolising an end to the darkness of war andto the light of peace.St Magnus Cathedral will remain the focus as, at .pm, the bells will ring alongside , others across the nation and beyond.Between pm and pm, the short film specially commissioned by the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative for the centenary of the armistice will be projected onto the cathedral for the last time.The convener of Orkney Islands Council, Harvey Johnston, said: “We are grateful to everyone who has worked with us so far to ensure we have a fitting programme of events here in Orkney for people to mark this momentous occasion and pay their respects to forbears who suffered so much. I hope people will involve and immerse themselves in these events as much as they can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Inkson, have been fondly remembered down the years and credited with greatly boosting the French linguistic capabilities of those involved.As well as sowing the seeds for lasting friendships, one of the exchanges also led to the eventual marriage of Alistair Swanson of Dingwall and Belgian Marie-Anny De Landsheer. Alistair lived next door to Marie-Annyrsquos Scottish exchange partner, Sandra, daughter of the late Sandy and Lilly Macrae.With some of those attending a th anniversary meeting in Dingwall now in their s and s, there was much to catch on. One of those present, George Robertson, said the stark contrast between the new and old Dingwall Academy buildings amazed those present.\"The day began with a guided tour of Dingwall Academy, graciously hosted by rector, Mrs Karen Cormack and two equally charming assistants, Ceitidh Petrie of fth Year and head girl, Anna-Maria Stewart of sixth year. We were amazed by the change in the Academy mdash from the grim corridors with its memories of rooms with formal rows of desks, piles of jotters and frequent administrations of summary justice mdash with the lsquoLochgelly Specialrsquo mdash to the cosy, student-friendly comfort of modern classrooms, sumptuously equipped with digital projectors and interactive whiteboards.\"Gone are the dingy cloakrooms, in the corners of which, stressed-out procrastinators struggled furiously to finish their homework on time! Gone too, are the endless, uncouth nicknames we used to give our teachers, Pirrac, Froggy, Daisy-lugs, Kate Stew, Inky, Willie the War, Kramer, Horace, Scabbac, Sinkie, Snottery Tom and so on.\"He added: \"We soon realised that Dingwall Academy is a much happier, kinder place than the strictly regimented establishment, where we learned, suffered, cried, laughed and fell in, and out, of love! The old school, however, was not all bad, because we had the good fortune of being taught by many caring, brilliant teachers who inspired and challenged us, and whom we still remember with great fondness. J.K.Inkson was one of those par excellence, but kind and modest, despite his many gts.\"After welcome refreshments in the Academy cafe, the group enjoyed a tour of Dingwall Museum.Mr Robertson said: \"The culminating highlight of our day was, without doubt, the get-together and dinner in the Royal Hotel, Cromarty. We were able to catch up with more of our old friends and former schoolmates. We were formally welcomed by Sandra Collardand by Marie-Anny, who addressed us in flawless English. The dinner was a splendid affair, with a host of gastonomic delicacies, all excellently prepared.\"The old friends recalled the lasting benefits of their exchanges down the years. Mr Robertson said: \"We were particularly glad to have a representative of the Inkson family with us, in the form of J.K.rsquos daughter, Helen, and we were pleased to hear a message of greeting from his son, Kerr, who lives in Auckland, New Zealand.\"Kerr wrote of his pride in the job his father had done, developing and managing the exchanges. He also wished us all a happy evening together. We remembered with fondness, all those who were no longer with us, and especially J.K.Inkson himself, to whose memory all drank a fitting toast.\"Warm thanks were also expressed to Sandra Collard who helped maintain contacts and organise the event and Marie-Anny who \"emulated mdash and surpassed mdash her fictional compatriot, Monsieur Poirot, in locating so many of our Belgian friends\".Although Marie-Anny was the only surviving Belgian veteran who felt able to undertake the long journey to Ross-shire, Mr Robertson said: \"There has been a great exchange of email addresses, and it looks like the ether will be buzzing with electronic correspondence between old friends in Britain and Belgium.\"Well done, Marie-Anny and Sandra, for giving us one of the most memorable days of our lives, and thank you Alistair, for your magical photographic memories of this wonderful occasion!\"Friday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The ersion could then reopen to traffic shortly after a train clears the other side.Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP, Ian Blackford has been campaigning for the revised system with support from Scottish Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson.Mr Blackford said: \"This has the potential to be great news and work now must be put in place to make these plans a reality. I would like to put on record my gratitude to Network Rail for listening to concerns of the local community and of representatives like myself.\"Despite matters relating to Network Rail being reserved to Westminster, I knew the best hope was for the Scottish Government to try and make clear that the sorry state of affairs that we have all witnessed, couldnrsquot be allowed to continue. Let me be frank, these changes would not have been possible without the intervention of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson MSP.\"The local communities deserve a huge amount of credit as well. Local representatives have campaigned tirelessly and have sought to keep people informed when information wasnrsquot always forthcoming from Highland Council.\"I hope now that we can move forward from what has been an extremely trying situation for local communities.\"Network Rail confirmed the new system is something it is actively looking into, but that it was not yet in a position to proceed and had no specic start date for its introduction.But a spokesman added that the system was similar to one that was introduced on the same stretch of track in  after another serious landslide, so the idea is feasible.Friday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It will also look at whether the tests should continue or “whether they be substantially modied or whether they should be stopped”.Mr Swinney added: “The outcome of the review could be a recommendation to stop the assessments. The review will be led by evidence and what is best for pupils.”Ministers have defended the tests, insisting they provide an important gauge of children’s development in the crucial early years and identy particular areas where they may need help.Ministers have also insisted there should not be “set specic windows” for schools to undertake assessments.Some councils have already looked into the prospect of scrapping the tests, since the vote in parliament and amid concerns among parents.Larry Flanagan of the EIS teaching union said the reservations of the profession over the value of the tests had been spelled out to Mr Swinney.He said the union was disappointed the tests were not being scrapped immediately, but added: “We accept, however, that in establishing an independent review, the Deputy First Minister is open to evidence about the efficacy of the SNSAs [Scottish National Standardised Assessments], although we would make the point that perhaps a review of the evidence before the introduction of the tests would have been more appropriate.”The move prompted an angry reaction from opposition parties after they united to out-vote the minority SNP government at Holyrood last month and backed a motion calling for the tests to be axed.• Read more: Quiz: Could you pass Scotland’s P test Labour education spokesman Iain Gray said: “This whole statement was a justication for refusing to respect the motion and defying this Parliament. The cabinet secretary demands that we focus on education needs – that’s exactly what we did in reaching the conclusion that we did a month ago. Parliament listened to teachers, parents and the education arguments and voted accordingly.”Conservative MSP Liz Smith hit back at Mr Swinney’s claims that opposition parties were guilty of political opportunism in their opposition to the testing regime. She questioned whether “Primary  teachers and those members of the public and parents opposing these tests are also a disgrace and guilty of political opportunism”.The review was branded a “missed opportunity” by Greens education spokesman Ross Greer. He said: “They could have proven that they’re listening to teachers, parents, experts and parliament. They could have called a halt to these tests of four- and five-year-olds, but instead, the tests will continue.”Liberal Democrat education spokesman Tavish Scott said: “ days ago John Swinney published what he said was an evidence-based review and it was a whitewash. Now he wants another review.“Teachers say national testing of five-year-old boys and girls add nothing to their knowledge of the child’s progress.

In addition, with two performance improvement plans in force, poor punctuality that has caused misery for commuters should have been turned round and be firmly on an upward trajectory. But none of that has happened.Only around ten of  brand new electric trains are in service, such as on the main Edinburgh-Glasgow line. The first should have been introduced more than a year ago, but they have been delayed by series of problems including to their windscreens and brakes, and setbacks to the electrication of the route.The introduction of the other fleet, of -year-old diesels for longer-distance inter-city routes, has been equally problematic. The first of the  trains did not enter service until a week ago, some eight months late, after refurbishment of the carriages was severely delayed. Problems even included the wrong type of thread being used in their new carpets.: Alastair Dalton: How to find hidden cheaper rail faresThat will mean most of the first ten trains, which are due to be operating by December, having to carry passengers in an unrefurbished state. “Classic” is the official description.A year ago, just as ScotRail was showing off the first of the trains north of the Border, one of its former stablemates still at Great Western Railway in England caught fire.Two weeks ago, another of the trains broke down on ScotRail’s inaugural preview run from Aberdeen to Edinburgh.On top of all this, the ScotRail Alliance’s train punctuality, which has struggled for two years, has further noseed.: Alastair Dalton: Roadtesting ScotRail’s new train reveals many changesWhile officials stressed the impact of last month’s Storm Ali on bringing down the latest figures, there has been a malaise for months despite improvement plans being implemented in autumn  and April this year.I’m told an increasing proportion of the delays are caused by track and signalling faults which are the responsibility of Network Rail, rather than ScotRail’s trains breaking down.However, this is causing bad blood between the two bodies, which are supposedly working closer than ever before, because Network Rail is being “named” when things go wrong.In the old days, they diplomatically referred to each other as “our industry partners”.I hear transport secretary Michael Matheson this week voiced impatience at the lack of improvement. However, the SNP mantra that fuller control of Network Rail by Scotland would solve the problem has been rubbished by many in the industry.The pressure is on, and the next big test will come in December when the alliance attempts to add a raft of extra trains, such as a new Edinburgh-Glasgow service via Cumbernauld.It will seek to avoid a repeat of the enduring chaos down south this year when several train operators launched over-ambitious bigger timetables onto a network that couldn’t cope.Building the best railway Scotland has ever had is still very much a work in progress – and on current form, it may well remain that for quite some time to come.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4820070.1540490489!/image/image.jpg","title":"jim duffy three bands that help give scotland a good name overseas","story":"People in other countries often smile when you say you#re Scottish and one reason is our music, says Jim Duffy.It’s interesting when travelling abroad to watch people’s reactions when you tell them you are Scottish.Nine times out of ten, they smile and one can tell from their reactions that they kind of like the Scots. Although we are part of the United Kingdom, we never seem to be classed alongside England, when it comes to our identity as a grouping of people.Foreigners, for want of a better descriptor, perceive us be that bit dferent from our neighbours down south and across the Irish Sea. And when there is a drink involved, the discussion will always come round to football or music. Yes, it seems we Scots have made it into global stardom because of the bands we have produced. So, who is your favourite To keep it simple here, we are talking about bands, not inidual musicians. Some of you may class this as unfair as you adore the likes of Rod Stewart. But, while Sir Rod is undoubtedly a mega star, there are smaller bands who have had great success and are just as well known internationally.Many moons ago, I was an air steward working for British Airways. I was  and operating on s out of Heathrow. It was halcyon days for BA when Lord King and Sir Colin Marshall were at the helm. I was rostered on an -day trip to Australia. On boarding and completing my pre-flight checks with the crew “doon the back” in economy, one of the Club Class crew ran down and asked, “Anyone Scottish here ”The surprise she had was that Deacon Blue were travelling in business class for gigs in Australia. Well, you can imagine just how fast I legged it to door two left, where I saw the band board and take their seats. It was surreal and fabulous. Suffice to say, the band members were great fun with the crew and I thoroughly enjoyed chinwagging with Dougie Vipond and James Prime, two guys who play a big part in the song Dignity. And I just loved singing along to this when I eventually went to see them at the Armadillo in Glasgow.: Jim Duffy: I lapped up Brexit’s fairytale, but it’s become a nightmareI guess you can tell from that little anecdote that Deacon Blue rate very highly in my top three Scottish bands. The album Raintown is a classic and I still have it in my playlist on Spoty. But, while Deacon Blue are a very strong candidate for the number one spot, there are others that stand out.How about Simple Minds  When it comes to demonstrating international presence, these guys have shown they have got what it takes. No doubt, having the theme song in the movie The Breakfast Club catapulted them into the USA in a big way. Crack the US and you’ve made it! But, Simple Minds are more than just a band who penned decent music. They were very much involved in politics, which did them no harm in selling records. The album Street Fighting Years – with its emphasis on the troubles in South Africa – was a cracker. Released in May , the album reached the top of the UK album charts. Selling out big venues across the globe, Simple Minds must feature in my top three Scottish bands. I eventually managed to see them perform live in Birmingham. They were good ...While on the subject of Scottish bands I have seen perform live, Travis are next up. I was lucky enough to catch them perform in Boston in one of their last gigs as part of their US tour. Again, they were terric and packed the venue. Great lyrics, fantastic melodies and real personality on stage. Fran Healy, the front man, was excellent in the way he handled the crowd. I have a story for another day on this one.: Jim Duffy: Why today’s kids are the worst behaved for a generationSo, there you go, my top three Scottish bands, but in no particular order. So what about the others that you may like and that have had impact here and overseas How about Texas with the lead singer Charlene Spiteri  Texas could rock a venue and had some great hits, notably for me, Halo, which is just great to pop on in my headphones. Texas were strong, but I’m not surethey were just as big as the others, despite a loyal following, who may be pretty upset that I have not grouped them in my top three. Other groups come to mind such as Del Amitri, The Fratellis, Altered Images, Capercaillie and The Skids. But, the last couple of paragraphs have to go to bands who are pretty awesome, but not in my top three.Many of you will be shouting out: what about the Bay City Rollers  And quite right too. The tartan-clad heart throbs of the Seventies are a Scottish institution, albeit, they were gone as quick as they arrived. The whirlwind that was the Bay City Rollers in the s still has some puff, despite them going though hell. So, while not having the staying power of many other great Scottish groups, they deserve a mention.Wet Wet Wet will also feature for many of you as band that produced brilliant songs and had a terric sound. There is no doubt that Marti Pellow could chant and entertain. And Wet Wet Wet had one of the best-selling singles of all time in the UK, Love is all around. I believe the group actually pulled it from the charts after  weeks at the top.But, I cannot end this piece without paying tribute to a wee band that always get talked about abroad as one song they belted out always gets everyone up singing. Yes, The Proclaimers and  miles. It never fails to cheer up a night out anywhere in the world.Time to get your headphones on and get some Scottish bands filling your ear canals.“And I would walk  ...” That will set you up for the day now!©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4820096.1540537962!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit pro eu mps tell barnier to prepare for brexit u turn","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Michel Barnier was told to get ready for the UK to change its mind on Brexit through a fresh referendum in a meeting with pro-EU opposition politicians.The group of senior SNP, Liberal Democrat, Plaid Cymru and Green figures claimed to be envoys of the “resistance” to Brexit at Westminster and told the EU chief negotiator there was no consensus on how the UK should leave the -nation bloc.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford was joined at the meeting in the European Commission’s Berlaymont headquarters by Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts, and the Green Party MEP Molly Scott Cato.They told Mr Barnier that opposition parties were working with pro-EU MPs in the Labour Party and Conservative rebels to defeat the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal and force a so-called People’s Vote to give the public a chance to stay in the EU.In a joint statement, the group said their one-hour meeting with Mr Barnier was “constructive” and claimed the UK’s exit from the EU “must not be assumed”.“We emphasised that there is a cross-party resistance in Westminster to the destructive Brexit being pursued by the Tories,” the group said. In an attack on Jeremy Corbyn’s lukewarm support for a fresh referendum on EU membership, the group added that “this is being waved through by the Labour frontbench, but no majority exists in Parliament for the current Brexit trajectory.”The SNP’s Westminster leader has signalled a strengthening of the party’s support for another Brexit referendum in recent days, saying he is prepared to push the issue forward in the CommonsMPs reject the Prime Minister’s deal with Brussels.Following yesterday’s meeting, Mr Blackford said: “The UK government’s reckless approach to negotiations threatens livelihoods and ignores the clear wishes of the people of Scotland.“Scotland voted to remain in the EU and we continue to press the UK Government to stay in the Single Market and Customs Union so we can protect jobs and living standards”Mr Cable said he told Mr Barnier it was “time to start serious contingency planning for a People’s Vote... because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.”Mr Barnier was also asked to provide guarantees to UK citizens living in the EU that their rights would be status would be protected even in a no-deal Brexit. “It is simply the right thing to do,” Mr Cable said.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said yesterday that while Labour were open to a second EU referendum, its preference was for a general election because “we are trying to bring the whole country together”. “The country is still ided right down the middle,” he added.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"no shortage of goals in action packed weekend ","story":"There was loads of football action on Saturday with LK Galaxy claiming a convincing win against Tizers to win the Association Cup.Final score was an incredible -, with no fewer than five goals coming from Jordan Thomason.Meanwhile, the contest for the County Shield was won by Ness at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Friday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Ms Blessington revealed: \"It was handmade by Hamish Stone, of Nethy Bridge, and he painstakingly followed the  pages of directions from online to create the pizza oven from the redundant interior walls of the railway station.\"Another attraction is the purpose built Highland games field. Mr Garman has competed for many years on the circuit in his native United States and now nearer to his Revack home although injury prevented him this past season.There will be games demonstrations with the Grantown East staff getting involved too.The venue is horseshoe shaped to allow maximum viewing pleasure. Mr Garman said: \"I have been to hundreds of Highland games fields and the only thing I have always found is the spectators can not get high enough to see what is going on and also get good pictures.\"We will be staging demonstrations as many times as we possible can.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis.

That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them.

They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels. They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain. “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.“A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8670196.1539680805!/image/image.jpg","title":"council rolls out 2018 enterprise week activities","story":"With this year#s Enterprise Week rolling out from November  to , businesses and entrepreneurs across the borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon are being urged to be part of this enterprising initiative.Spearheaded by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council and sponsored by Bank of Ireland, the week-long programme will see a range of inspirational and informative events take place across the borough, demonstrating council’s commitment to nurturing and developing the local economy.

We will have state of the art facilities, this will be a top rate training facility for local clubs and schools. Our kids deserve this. There will be high-tech lighting that will illuminate the pitch but won’t effect the houses near by.“It’s vital that local kids get full use of this facility, we want it filled to capacity every day with schools, we envisage coaches training kids here, Gaelic clubs, soccer clubs, after-schools activities and outdoor gym classes. I believe this will transform the community.”Work is due to begin in December andall goes according to plan it should be completed by the end of March.Cllr Baker said the investment by Belfast City Council is a big boost for the community. “This area suffered badly under Lisburn Council and we are delighted now that this huge investment has come into the area. We have a population of just under , people here and they deserve nothing but first class facilities and that’s what we are delivering.“As a father and a member of the community here I would love nothing better than on a Sunday morning having a blitz here, rather than going to other parts of Belfast. I’m very excited about the future.”Sinn Féin MLA Órlaithí Flynn added: “I welcome the investment coming into the Lagmore area and commend the great work that has been done by our local Councillor in securing improvements to the White Rise pitch. The youth in this area and the wider Lagmore community will reap the benefits of important enhancements such as this.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/stevie.png","title":"new cemetery needed for belfast","story":"AN all-party Cemeteries and Crematorium Development working group that was formed a year ago to tackle the ongoing issues around burial costs and cemetery maintenance and development, say they feel that Belfast graveyards and cemeteries need a radical overhaul to keep up with demand.The Council group, who meet on a monthly basis have been tasked with finding solutions and coming up with ideas for Belfast’s cemeteries.Councillor Stevie Corr is the Sinn Féin representative on the working group.“The idea of a new cemetery for West and North Belfast has been discussed for well over a decade now and has yet to come into fruition,” he said.“The City Cemetery for all intents and purposes is full, Milltown has limited availability as well, St Joseph’s cemetery in Hannahstown is only available to parishioners. New graves are only available in Blaris cemetery when someone dies, the days of pre-planning your funeral or purchasing multiple graves are gone, we are almost at crisis point with our cemeteries.”Last year Lisburn and Castlereagh Council was tendered for a new cemetery, however the tender was unsuccessful.Cllr Corr said: “Because of boundary changes people in the Colin area are no longer Lisburn Council meaning they will have to pay more to be buried in Blaris because that cemetery  crematorium is no longer in their jurisdiction.“This is reaching crisis point, we need to have a radical approach, review and rethink around the issue of burials, cremations and cemetery spaces. We can’t wait until the day somebody is refused burial because there is no space.”With that in mind Belfast City Council have come up with the new cemeteries working group to look at these issues and to also come up with ideas around the development of our cemeteries.Cllr Corr said: “I am the party representative on the group and we are coming up with some excellent plans. For example, a new multi-million pound upgrade will be going into Roselawn crematorium.“We still need a new cemetery for North and West Belfast, it’s a very sensitive subject.“Our cemeteries are also in a position where they can become historical and tourist attractions. Look at Tom Hartley’s cemetery tours, they tell the tale of our city, from rich tombs and headstones to poor grounds where thousands of our poor are buried.“Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin is one of the main tourist attractions on the island of Ireland, it went from being a crime hotspot to being a place of beauty and interest, because it tells the tale of the formative years around the formation of the Irish Free State – our cemeteries are no dferent.“There have been books written about the City Cemetery and Milltown Cemetery.”Cllr Corr continued: “Clton Street Graveyard contains the graves of some historically signicant families, including the Dunvilles, the Sinclairs and Henry Joy McCracken, one of the leading United Irishmen. It was closed to public access approximately  years ago due to anti-social behavior. This has now decreased and the local area of Henry Place has been re-generated and a new business hub has been formed. The graveyard remains locked due to concern regarding the safety of some of the monuments. There are currently regular requests for access from tourists and visitors with a genealogical or historical interest in the graveyard.“Our social, political, economic and religious history are in our cemeteries and we need to have them as places we can use for education.“Take for example the City Cemetery heritage project, we want to bring tourists, academics and school children in as well as the local community.Our cemeteries are at their safest when people are in them, Tom Hartley’s tours have proved that.“The purpose of this working group is to give an extra edge and focus while giving the issues of graves, cemeteries and monuments the attention they deserve.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"newington boss crossan demands swift improvement","story":"Steel and Sons Cup quarter-finalSt James’ Swts vNewington Donegal Celtic ParkNEWINGTON manager, Conor Crossan has demanded an improved showing from his side as they continue the defence of their Steel and Sons Cup title with a quarter-final away trip to St James’ Swts on Saturday. The North Belfast side suffered a - home defeat to Lurgan Celtic earlier this month as they lost ground to Championship  league leaders Annagh United. Last Saturday, they bowed out of the Intermediate Cup following a - penalty shoot-out defeat at Maiden City after the game finished - after  minutes. Crossan feels Saturday’s game is the perfect opportunity for his side to rediscover their form in a competition that is close to their hearts. “We are looking forward to Saturday, hopefully we can get back to winning ways,” said Crossan.“The boys know that the performances haven’t been good enough over the last couple of weeks. “We want to stay in as many cup competitions as we can because of the way the league is structured. “It was a poor result and a poor performance against Lurgan Celtic and we had a few players out last Saturday, but it was sore getting beat on penalties.“You always want to be going into the big games on the back of a win and our form of the last two weeks hasn’t been good. “We are going into this match against a team that has won  from  so they’ll be full of confidence. It will be up to me to get the team up for this game.” As defending champions, Newington will be the favourites to progress, especially considering they play in a higher league. Yet, the progress made by St James’ Swts hasn’t gone unnoticed in the north of the city and Crossan is refusing to underestimate the challenge posed by the Swts at Donegal Celtic Park on Saturday. “People might underestimate the Ballymena League, but you have some great teams in that league – the likes of Bangor and Coagh and teams who were in Championship  in recent years,” added the Newington boss. “They are playing at a good level and they have players who have experience of playing in the Irish League. “They’ll be full of confidence and I don’t think they lost too much sleep when they drew us.“They are the type of team who relish the challenge no matter who they face. “They’ve been making noise for a while now.“They will want to build on that start and keep going, but hopefully we can put a stop to that winning run on Saturday.” St James’ Swts assistant manager Dan Murphy, meanwhile, insists the club is “buzzing” ahead of Saturday’s eagerly-anticipated clash with the defending Steel and Sons Cup champions. The West Belfast side have made an incredible start to the   season and have won all  of their game so far. The only stain on an otherwise perfect start came when they lost the points following their - win over last year’s Ballymena and Provincial League winners Glebe after it emerged one of their players should have been serving a suspension arising from a ban with his previous club. St James’ are aiming to go a step further than they managed in last season’s competition when they bowed out after losing - to Linfield Swts in the last eight.  “The whole club is buzzing, we know how big this competition is. We got to this stage last year and we lost out to Linfield Swts,” said Murphy. “We were - down and we gave a penalty away and went - down. “We got a goal back and we threw everything at them to get an equaliser and we make a silly mistakes and they broke and made it -. “It was a bit gut-wrenching. We wanted to go on further in the competition and we are just hoping to go one step further this year and make it into the semi-finals.” Last season, the Swts challenged for promotion from the Ballymena and Provincial League Premier Division, but fell short at the end of a busy campaign. This season, they are, strictly speaking, unbeaten on the pitch and Murphy feels that is in no small part because of the summer signings made by manager Damien McStravick. “Last year, we knew we had a good team and we were playing good football,” said Murphy. “Towards the end of the season, it was just injuries and suspensions that killed us.“Our squad was a bit light and a few boys had to play with knocks. “During the summer, we made some brilliant signings thanks to Damien McStravick. He met boys who had played at a higher level and sold them on the ethos of the club. “We ended up with a smashing squad. “We kept all the players we had last year and we’ve added a bit more quality to it. “The new boys have all bought into what the club is about and they are enjoying their football.” This Saturday, St James’ bid to continue their incredible start to the season by dumping the holders out of the Steel and Sons Cup. However, Murphy is expecting a tough battle from the North Belfast side given that Newington went on to defeat Linfield Swts in last year’s Christmas Day final at Seaview. “They are a very dogged team and they work hard for each other. They are able to take their chances when they get them,” added the St James’ Swts assistant. “We also know they are the champions of this competition and they’re no going to let go of it easily. “We played them in pre-season and we won that game -, but they signed well after that game. “We know we are going to be up against it and it will be a real test. “We have to be at our best, but the way we are playing, I thinkwe show up on the day, we can win the game.” Newington will be without the suspended duo of Gavin Taggart and Kevin Bradley for Saturday’s clash while St James’ Swts are set to be at full strength for the quarter-final tie."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sf%e2%80%88asked to take","story":"ALLIANCE South Belfast MLA Paula Bradshaw has called for the removal of the election-style anti-Brexit posters erected by Sinn Féin in parts of the constituency. The South Belfast MLA slammed the “unwelcome eyesore” saying they are in breach of regulations. “We saw the strength of feeling against Brexit in South Belfast and across the city aptly demonstrated by the Rally for Remain demonstration on Saturday,” she explained. “That was a clear exhibition of what most local people think about Brexit, and particularly about the ludicrous notion of leaving the EU with no future deal in place. #However, while everyone has a right to demonstrate their stance, posters, which have appeared in ious parts of the constituency are unwelcome, even by those who support the broad message on them.

The company behind the plan, Blue Star Line, said the new ship will include all the latest safety and technical equipment to make it fit for the st Century seas. Originally the Titanic was owned by the White Star Line.Reports claim there will be nine decks and  staterooms that can accommodate , passengers and  crew members, the same as the Belfast original.First, second, and third class tickets will be available, just like the original and there will be a swimming pool, gymnasiums, and Turkish bath.However, the engines will be diesel-powered rather than coal fired but the iconic smoke stacks will remain. Clive Palmer, the Autralian business man behind the project said the maiden voyage will take travellers from Southampton to New York on the same route as the ill-fated  voyage. Then it will cruise around the world from Dubai hoping to \"enchant\" passengers with the style of the old world mixed with the new.It has been rumoured the ship will first lt anchor in , however, the company has said it is still in the early stages of planning and due diligence for the plan. “Millions have dreamt of sailing on her, seeing her in port and experiencing her unique majesty. Titanic II will be the ship where those dreams come true,” Clive Palmer said, thereported. A computer generated graphic of the new Titanic II.“The ship will follow the original journey, carrying passengers from Southampton to New York, but she will also circumnavigate the globe, inspiring and enchanting people while attracting unrivalled attention, intrigue and mystery in every port she visits.\"Speculation over the project has gathered pace over recent weeks after a series of announcements from Blue Star Line. On Tuesday it announced it would base its European office in Paris as opposed to London which will open in March .The photograph shows bodies in sacks piled three high on the deck of the CS Mackay Bennett, before being tipped overboard as the ships priest conducts a service. Photo issued by Henry Aldridge and Son.“It is of little use having a European headquarters outside Europe,’’ Mr Palmer said.Mr Palmer confirmed discussions were underway between project’s World Director and suppliers and consultants world-wide to get Titanic II underway as soon as possible.And last week the company announced the appointment of a European director - who had originally been part of the project in  - for the project who will be responsible for commercial negotiations, recruitment and training for Titanic II, the company said. At the end of September, the company released a new technical specications update in a YouTube video. Palmer was a former elected member of the Australian parliament and has announced he is standing again for election under the slogan \"Make Australia Great Again\". He has a dinosaur theme park in Australia and the Titanic project plan has been described as his \"pet project\". A second Titanic II is also being built in a theme park in China.

Although the changes are not due to come in until after the UK leaves on March  next year, the UK would have to adopt the measures during any transition period, peers said. Current rules mean every state has to switch to summer time on the last Sunday of March and switch back to winter time on the last Sunday of October but the European Commission proposals would stop the practice.EU countries fall into three timezones - Greenwich Mean Time, Central European Time and Eastern European Time."},{"url":null,"title":"primark and royal avenue walkway to open in belfast in weeks","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have agreed a walkway solution with the council to open up Royal Avenue. Work has started and it should be in place in a matter of weeks. \"Since the devastating fire at Bank Buildings, it has been our ambition to be up and trading in Belfast as soon as possible. We are planning to open in Commonwealth House, Castle Street in December. We believe that opening up a Primark store in the city centre at this time will help to restore footfall into the area.”Councillor Matt Garrett, chairman of the council’s planning committee, said: “I’m pleased that we have been able to give the green light to this application and work can now get underway with the aim of reducing the cordon as soon as possible, and as soon as it is safe to do so.“The committee has asked for an undertaking from Primark that it will begin work as soon as practically possible.\"There is a real urgency for businesses, both inside and outside the cordon, to ensure their economic resilience in the run-up to Christmas and beyond, so it’s vital that Primark moves forward and ensures the required works are completed as soon as possible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch is this first speech in irish in commons as mp asks for northern ireland language act","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Plants havent had a chance to help me out. Coming up to my abort values on #KurtisInAJar pic upuZLiogn— Kurtis BauteOctober , “It did end sooner than I expected, but that’s okay,” Kurtis told the Press Association. “Environments are complicated things, and it’s easy to be too optimistic about your predictions.”Kurtis said he could feel himself becoming “sluggish” in the chamber and a paramedic who checked his blood as he was released said it was “a little bit” high in CO.“Fortunately our bodies,they are healthy, are really good at compensating for that and in most cases all that’s needed is a breath of fresh air,” the YouTuber from Vancouver said. Before the experiment he tweeted: “The messed up thing about my experiment is that some of my abort valuesare just everyday experiences for many people on this planet.”Deeeep breath. No wait, just stay calm. Dont panic!What a roller coaster. #KurtisInAJar pic UgtvAWii— Kurtis BauteOctober , Despite the shorter stay in the dome, Kurtis is happy that its fuelled the conversation on climate change.“I’ve been truly moved by the scale of the conversation this has started,” he said. “I’ve had so many people tell me on Twitter that this has inspired them to become a vegetarian, a vegan, to drive less, and on and on. It’s been incredible.”You’re an inspiration, Kurtis! We are going down to a single car household, I take public transit to work, and going to start cutting meat of out my diet! Good luck!— Eric HolmesOctober , #KurtisInAJar Hi, I will be vegetarian five days a week from now on. You are an inspiration.— coco rozziOctober , Kurtis says there are parallels that can be drawn between his biodome and Earth’s atmosphere.“Something that’s critical is that they are both closed systems,” he said. “Air is a finite resource. “Yes, plants absorb carbon dioxide, butwe put out too much too quickly, there isn’t time for them to do what they do and it builds up in the atmosphere.“For me, that meant I was risking suffocating, but for Earth, we are risking our entire climate.All safe. My goal here was is to engage people about #climatechange, and seeing the response on twitter I feel like its been a huge success. Thanks to everyone for your support. Now is just the beginning - its time to change our lestyles!— Kurtis BauteOctober , “Personally, this has totally changed my relationship with the air that we inhabit. “I literally used to see right through it, this fluid that we are immersed in  hours a day, but now I see that it is a literal le-force, allowing us to get energy out of our food.“We have to take a deep breath and start treating our atmosphere better.“We need all hands on deck with this.”If you’d like to keep up to date with Kurtis’s work, check out his YouTube channel and Twitter page."},{"url":null,"title":"this guys pumpkin carving of thanos has to be seen to be believed","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Only a portion of Boracay’s hotels and other businesses have reopened under the new rules, and a fraction of more than , workers who lost their jobs have been rehired.“Let us treat the island as our home. Keep it clean and pristine. Don’t drink alcohol or smoke in the beach, don’t litter,” tourism secretary Berna Romulo-Puyat said in a message to incoming tourists.I am excited for your big day Boracay🙌🏼Ang ganda ganda mo ngayon🤗 #nofilter #responsibletourism #sustainabletourism #itsmorefuninthephilippines🇵🇭 pic jnYQmEDup— Berna Romulo PuyatOctober , Cabinet officials and local celebrities attended a ceremony to mark Boracay’s “soft opening” on a white sand beach near a port where ferries unloaded tourists.German tourist Lora Hoerhammer, among the first foreign visitors to set foot on the spruced-up island, backed the six-month closure. “We said wow, that is a good thing to really close the whole environment so that nature can rest for a second and people can clean up everywhere,” the -year-old German said. “Everybody will be able to come back and feel … that it’s a better place for everybody.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Visitors on the beach on Boracay island Visitors will be kept to about , daily and will be asked to sign an oath to follow the new rules, including proper waste disposal and a ban on liquor, smoking, bonfires and wild partying on the beach, officials said.Only  of Boracay’s hundreds of hotels, inns, restaurants and souvenir shops have reopened after complying with the regulations, including connecting to authorised sewer pipes and maintaining a -metre distance from the ocean.Gil delos Santos, whose family owns a -room inn called Roy’s Rendezvous, a travel agency and passenger ferries, welcomed Boracay’s reopening.“The weather is good and the water is so clear. This is the best way to welcome a better Boracay,” said the -year-old. “It’s like Boracay got a reboot.”President Rodrigo Duterte ordered Boracay shut in February for rehabilitation and said the waste being discharged into the sea had made its waters a “cesspool”.During the closure, authorities discovered a hidden sewage pipe discharging waste directly into the coastal waters, and two hotels built on restricted wetlands. Some resorts were demolished because they had encroached into a no-build area fronting the sea — one of many violations that had been unchecked for years in one of the country’s top tourist draws.A mayor was suspended and  other officials faced complaints of neglect of duty over Boracay’s deterioration.More than two million tourists visited Boracay last year to enjoy its sandy beaches, spectacular sunsets and festive nightle, generating about  billion pesosin revenue, but the influx and neglect threatened to turn it into a “dead island” in less than a decade, according to a government study."},{"url":null,"title":"magee students developing next generation computing engineering technology","story":"Computing  Engineering Insight Evening @ MageeCome and talk with us and see our facilities on Wednesday th November  between : to : at our “Computing  Engineering Insight Evening”.The School of Computing, Engineering and Intelligent Systemson the Magee campus of Ulster University is a place of discovery with teaching and research that offers students the opportunity to complete an undergraduate course in their favourite STEM subject Computer Science, Information Technologies, Articial Intelligence, Electronics and Embedded Systems, Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, Renewable Energy Engineering or Electrical and Electronic Engineering.

But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process. But the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gold for James at cyclo cross race in Belfast  ","story":"A LARGE number of Dromara riders competed in round five of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross series in Musgrave park on Sunday, the event organised by VC Glendale.It was a rainy start to the day, but it did not dampen the spirits of Dromararsquos young riders.Hugh Hetherington, Tom Cowan and Anna Armstrong were the first to take to the course in the U- race.

It is vitally important the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site is used for the benefit of the community,he continued.ldquoAny future planning applications will involve a consultation process that enables the public to have their say on the future development.The Downpatrick councillor suggested that given the current parking and traffic flow issues at Edward Street, there was a need for an ultra-modern primary school in the town to continue to provide a high standard of childrenrsquos education.He declared: ldquoI believe the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site would be ideal for a new school development and will be writing to the Education Authority to ask that they investigate the sitersquos potential for such a development.ldquoI will also be asking Newry, Mourne and Down Council to review options for this site as it could also be ideal for other community facilities.A spokesman for the diocese of Down and Connor confirmed on Monday that the former St Patrickrsquos Boys Primary School site will be placed on the market for sale.He added: ldquoThe diocesan Trustees are legally bound to act in the best interests of the charity and to consider all offers made through the public market process.ldquoIn the case of sales of former school sites, the diocesan Trustees are required toa substantial percentage of the sale price to the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.A number of people have taken to social media in the wake of news that the former school site is to be sold and expressed concern about the impact its redevelopment could have on an already heavily congested part of the town.Several have suggested a new school should be built on the site, while others believe its redevelopment could have problems securing planning permission given the topography of this part of the town and traffic congestion in nearby Edward Street.A number of people said they would not be in favour of any form of retail development at the former school site..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Staff being followed home by unruly teenagers  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick have revealed that some members of staff have been followed home by unruly teenagers who are terrorising the town centre with their behaviour.The worrying revelation came during a meeting held last week to discuss mounting concern about increasing anti-social behaviour in St Patrickrsquos Square, the Grove shopping centre area and other parts of the town.Within  hours of last weekrsquos meeting concluding, a firework was thrown at a customer as he left a hot food bar in St Patrickrsquos Square, narrowly missing him.Business owners fear someone is going to have to be seriously injured or worse before the ongoing trouble is addressed.They say the anti-social behaviour cannot be allowed to continue in the area, or in any other part of Downpatrick, and insist there must be immediate action to be bring the trouble to an end.Last weekrsquos meeting between local police, business owners and elected representatives was organised by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who has revealed there were a number of frank exchanges, with all those in attendance describing the talks as ldquoworthwhile.He also confirmed another session involving the parties is due to be held in mid-November.A businessman said it was ldquoentirely unsatisfactory that people who were trying to do a dayrsquos work should be terrorised by  and  year-old children operating outside the control of their parents and the police.ldquoIt is now getting dficult to recruit staff in Downpatrick town centre, he revealed.ldquoWe do not have these problems in Newcastle or Ardglass. Self-employed retailers pay tax and rates in an expectation that the government and Newry, Mourne and Down Council will ensure that the environment in our town centres is suitable for business and attractive to customers. We expect this situation to be turned around rapidly and not deteriorate further.During the meeting, business owners complained about having their staff harassed and having to close early, losing trade due to anti-social behaviour.Vehicles in the car park at the rear of the Grove shopping centre have been damaged, with business owners and local residentsrsquo group representatives expressing concern that police were not doing more to help bring about prosecutions.Residentsrsquo group members complained that they could no longer let their children play near the Grove or St Patrickrsquos Square, an area which they argued should be a major attraction in the town for adults and children alike.Fears were also expressed that this part of Downpatrick was now becoming ldquoout of bounds for the decent people in the town in the evenings.Cllr Enright said local police welcomed the opportunity to listen first-hand to what businesses and residentsrsquo associations had to say and agreed to meet met with them again next month to track progress in dealing with these issues.He also thanked South Down MLA Colin McGrath for attending the meeting and fellow MLA Emma Rogan for sending her apologies and confirming she will be at the November meeting.ldquoIt was clear that senior police officers were not aware of the scale of the problems in the town over the past nine months, Cllr Enright said.ldquoStatistics of reported crime did not reflect what was going on, with business owners surprised at the low number of prosecutions.ldquoThere appears to be a systemic problem in dealing with youth offending in the Public Prosecutions Service which insists on up to five repetitions of so-called lsquoyouth engagementrsquo by the police before considering bringing forward a prosecution.Cllr Enright suggested this left some of the worst culprits with little respect for or fear of the police.He confirmed that MLAs have been asked to raise this particular issue with the PPS, alongside concerns of people waiting up to  minutes to get through on the PSNIrsquos  number to report incidents.He said concern was also expressed about how reports of assaults, vandalism and intimidation were followed though, with some business owners keen for police to search young people whom they suspect of carrying fireworks.He added: ldquoThere was also criticism of the lsquoinvisibilityrsquo of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos community safety wardens, with some suggestions that robust action against anti-social behaviour issues at the Model Farm area may have been partly responsible for transferring the trouble to the town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traffic ‘worse than ever’ amid calls for filter lane  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to address mounting concern about traffic snarl-ups at a busy junction on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Local people and politicians have been campaigning for a new filter lane at the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road which is dealing with a signicant increase in traffic at peak periods.Vehicles can be queued from the junction as far back as Bishops Brae in the morning with the upsurge attributed to the number of organisations now based at the Downshire Civic Centre.The public sector campus is home to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the PSNI, Housing Executive and Fire and Rescue Service. The Downe Hospital is also part of the sprawling estate.Mrs Olwyn McColl, who lives at Vianstown Heights, says there has been a major increase in traffic using the junction over the past year and is urging roads officials to address the problem.She says there is available land to provide a filter lane which has the potential to signicantly reduce tailbacks.ldquoThe problem is getting worse and sitting in a tailback, especially in the mornings when parents are taking children to school and people are heading to work, can be very frustrating, she said.ldquoDue to the current layout of the junction, drivers wishing to turn left at the junction have to wait until the traffic in front of them clears. A new filter lane would help reduce waiting times.Mrs McColl said it would appear that an increasing number of drivers heading from the Newcastle direction in the morning were now using the Ballynoe and Bishops Brae roads, which was contributing to the congestion.ldquoThe problem is  times worse than it ever was, there is no doubt about that, she continued. ldquoThings are bad now and they could get worse when the nearby new civic amenity site opens early next year.ldquoMany of my neighbours share my concern and it would be greatroads officials could use the land which is available to provide a new filter lane. It would make such a dference.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he shared the frustration of those campaigning for the filter lane which has not yet been delivered.ldquoIn addition to the nearby Downshire Civic Centre, we have a large shopping centre, a nursery and primary school, leisure facility and very busy MOT centre which is all adding to the build-up of traffic at peak periods, he said.ldquoWhile I am delighted Downpatrick has a major public sector campus, we need to ensure the roads system can cope with the additional volume of traffic its provision has generated. An important step would be upgrading the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road.Cllr Curran believes a filter lane would not cost a signicant amount of money to provide and would go some way towards easing the current problem.ldquoThis particular junction is extremely busy in the morning, with a long tail back of vehicles a common occurrence. The creation of a filter lane allowing drivers wishing to turn left out of the Ballynoe Road would help reduce congestion, he said. lsquoThe provision of a new filter lane is a no brainer.Cllr Curran said that while roads officials previously identied a scheme to provide a new filter lane, they subsequently decided that, due to the close proximity of the Glebetown Drive housing area, a new slip road would cause ldquoroad safety issues.He added: ldquoI firmly believe that the time has come to revisit this particular proposal.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world.

David Sterling yesterday ed to the RHI Inquiry for his fourth day of evidence The inquiry’s  days of evidence have been devastating for the reputation of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, exposing failures across the organisation and a culture in which civil servants acquiesced in breaking their own rules in order to please Stormont ministers.On the inquiry’s penultimate day of evidence, Mr Sterling said: “I have to admit that multiple mistakes, multiple failings were made and that we should have done better.“As permanent secretary in the Department of Finance, when I attended the Public Accounts Committee two years ago I offered an apology on behalf of my time at the Department for Enterprise, Trade and Investment.“But I think it’s only right as head of the service I should recognise that the extent of the failings have been such that I should offer again, without hesitation, a profound and unequivocal apology for the mistakes that have been made.“And I want to take this opportunity to make a promise on behalf of the NICS board that we will do everything possible to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again.”Mr Sterling also gave a personal assurance that any action recommended by the inquiry would be implemented “quickly and fairly”.Inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin interjected to sharply remind Stormont’s top mandarin that he would have to deal with “the fact that this is not the first time” that these mistakes or omissions have happened, with a series of damning Audit Office reports having previously exposed some of the practices which led to the RHI scandal, including the failure to keep records and a refusal to believe whistle-blowers.After outlining past failures to deliver on assurances that “lessons have been learnt”, Sir Patrick told Mr Sterling: “So we do need to be convinced that third time round something’s going to be effective.”Mr Sterling said he agreed and acknowledged that there had been a repeat of behaviour from past scandals which ought to have ended, and went on to set out a series of bureaucratic steps which he said had been taken or were being worked on in an attempt to prevent a recurrence.However, he acknowledged that past reports commented not on an absence of rules but on a culture where those rules were not adhered to – something he said had to change.He endorsed the comments of the Comptroller and Auditor General that civil servants should treat public money asit was their own.Mankilled in NI road traffic collision Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"However, he insisted that the public should not view every civil servant through the prism of RHI, highlighting that thousands of civil servants work with diligence and integrity – and have done so in particularly trying circumstances for more than a year and a half in the absence of any form of ministerial direction.Mr Sterling went on to give a second apology to civil servants for the fact that he had played a role in the scandal – in that he was the most senior official in Arlene Foster’s department at the time when the scheme was set up without cost controls.Although Mr Sterling was not personally responsible for drawing up the scheme, he accepted responsibility as the most senior civil servant within the department at the time of that key failure.He said that as someone involved in the scheme he wanted to “offer an apology to the rest of the civil service who no doubt are having to deal with the fact that the credibility of the organisation as a whole has been called into question – unfairly in my view”.However, Mr Sterling accepted some people will question what they are hearing: “I can understand that people may be cynical or sceptical about what I am saying – but I would want to give you assurance that we are very serious about this.”try catch     .               ..

But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community. I look forward to coming home.To find out more about Bayscape, visit www.bayscape , call    or email info@bayscape. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers.

He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Rocket.jpg","title":"how to make a business rocket","story":"Posted on Wednesday  October  by Ulster Business How does a growing company help its expansion plans really take off  John Mulgrew takes a look at the options available to SMEs here when it comes to fundingWhat does a burgeoning small business do when it’s time to scale up There a numerous options for companies right across the business spectrum – and the options across the traditional banking world are plentul.But there’s additional assistance that can be garnered from less traditional sources, with feedback and support also coming from outside the conventional sphere.David Nelson, partner at KPMG private enterprise, a global professional services firm, says it “works with companies of all sizes and at every stage of their development -  from start-ups to established family businesses.”.“Our people understand what it takes for companies to be successful at every stage of development – from idea to exit – and will help them make the right decisions at every step of the way,” he said.“So the support we give to our clients ranges from business planning and raising capital through to help with expanding internationally, MA, tax advice, RD incentives, technical accounting matters and complying with regulatory requirements.”According to First Trust Bank’s head of business banking, Seamus McGuckin, there are “ious funding options available to assist SMEs as they grow”.“… be that asset finance, invoice discounting, revolving working capital, loan financing or overdraft facilities.“First and foremost, however the more important support we can offer our clients is our expertise and commitment to understanding their needs and then delivering a service to match. It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.
