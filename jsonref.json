Whereupon Britannia\u0027s captain suddenly had a furious official from the Miami port authority thumping on his door.The crew had just breached strict environmental regulations and the captain was handed a $10,000 (£7,700) fine plus an order to leave port within two hours.No matter that the Queen was due to host a state banquet on board that very evening, with two former U.S. presidents among the guests. Rules were rules. The Yacht would have to pack up and go.It was only after the direct intervention of the White House that Britannia was allowed to remain alongside. The banquet duly took place without further incident. The fabled \u0027special relationship\u0027 had worked its magic once again.It\u0027s a phrase, however, which is heard more often on this side of the Atlantic and there are commentators in both Britain and the U.S. who regard any notion of a \u0027special relationship\u0027 as sentimental, subservient wishful thinking on the part of the British Establishment.There have certainly been some strong inidual pairings between No 10 and the White House, notably Churchill and Roosevelt, Thatcher and Reagan and, latterly, Blair and George W. Bush.          Queen Elizabeth II rides on horseback with American President Ronald Reagan in Windsor, June 1982However, historians will note that there has been a more subtle, yet more consistent, \u0027special relationship\u0027 operating between the White House and Buckingham Palace throughout the reign of Elizabeth II — even during periods of deep political ision.Unlike the Queen\u0027s dealings with most countries, which have followed a well-established pattern, this is a friendship that has broken the bilateral mould. There can be few people in the U.S., let alone the rest of the world, who have lived through the administrations of 16 presidents — more than one-third of the total — and met 12 of them.Of the handful of private foreign holidays that the Queen has enjoyed in her life (all horse-related), five have been spent in the U.S.And in 2018, the Royal Family welcomed their first American Princess. Yet the Queen\u0027s own \u0027special relationship\u0027 goes back to the nursery.It was in 1939 that her parents travelled to Canada and the U.S. to bolster support for Britain ahead of impending hostilities in Europe. The royals rather enjoyed all the informality.The Queen wrote an excited letter to her daughters about a memorable picnic lunch: \u0027All our food on one plate — a little salmon, some turkey, some ham, lettuce, beans \u0026amp HOT DOGS too!\u0027While some Americans were appalled at the idea of serving hot dogs to a king, the Royal Family would never forget it.Growing up in wartime Windsor, Princess Elizabeth was acutely aware of the strain on her father as he tried to buoy the morale of a nation facing invasion at any moment, and she could sense the redemptive significance of America\u0027s entry into the war.          Queen Elizabeth signs on behalf of her dominion of Canada during the conclusion of the Power Project Ceremonies at the New York state end of the St. Lawrence Power DamCome victory and the drab, near-bankrupt years of austerity that followed, it was America that represented fun and glamour.Like so many others, the Princesses were entranced by the explosive arrival of the first American musical after the war, Oklahoma!Princess Margaret reportedly went to see it more than 30 times. Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip watched it together as a courting couple in 1947 People Will Say We\u0027re in Love has been one of \u0027their\u0027 songs ever since.The Queen\u0027s first experience of the U.S. was in 1951, when as Princess Elizabeth she interrupted a tour of Canada to meet President Harry Truman at the White House. Her first visit as Queen came in 1957 when she met President Dwight D. Eisenhower as well as the then-Vice-President Richard Nixon.Alongside formalities to mark the 350th anniversary of the first English colony at Jamestown, Virginia, the Queen and the Duke paid their first visit to a supermarket.           Pictured: The Queen of the World by Robert Hardman \u0027How nice you can bring your children along,\u0027 she told shoppers as she marvelled at the sight of a frozen-food section.Food was also on the agenda in 1959 when the Queen first entertained a U.S. president at home. Spending two days with the monarch at Balmoral, President Eisenhower found the experience so agreeable that he asked the Queen for \u0027her\u0027 scone recipe (though not her own, she duly transcribed it in her own hand).Disagreements after the Suez Crisis and then over Vietnam would strain the \u0027special relationship\u0027 on the political front, but not the rapport between the Windsors and the White House.In 1976, Gerald Ford invited the Queen across the Atlantic for a tumultuous state visit to honour the bicentenary of American independence. She was accompanied by her new Foreign Secretary, Anthony Crosland, and his American-born wife, who later recorded the Queen\u0027s advice on how to get through arduous tours like these.\u0027One plants one\u0027s feet like this,\u0027 the Queen told her. \u0027Always keep them parallel. Make sure your weight is evenly distributed. That\u0027s all there is to it.\u0027The advice would be invaluable, with a punishing itinerary in 100f (38c) heat. The centrepiece was a White House state banquet for more than 200 guests, including Hollywood stars Cary Grant, Telly Savalas and Merle Oberon.There was some amusement when the after-dinner cabaret, pop duo Captain \u0026amp Tennille, launched into their moderately risque hit Muskrat Love. That turned to considerable unamusement when President Ford invited the Queen to dance. The band chose that very moment to strike up a new tune: The Lady Is A Tramp.There was an even more awkward moment when Ford\u0027s successor arrived at Buckingham Palace a year later. Perhaps overcome with nerves on what was his first journey outside the U.S., Jimmy Carter became a little over-familiar with a senior member of the Royal Family.As William Shawcross notes in her official biography, the Queen Mother hated being told that she reminded people of their own mothers. Having informed her that she did, indeed, remind him of his own mother — \u0027Miz Lillian\u0027 — President Carter kissed the Queen Mother on the lips. As she later remarked, no one had done that since the death of George VI. \u0027I took a sharp step backwards,\u0027 she recalled, \u0027not far enough.\u0027Carter\u0027s successor, however, would enjoy one of the more enduring friendships between the Queen and any foreign politician. It certainly helped that Ronald Reagan was an accomplished horseman. When he came to Windsor Castle for a semi-private stay in 1982, the two heads of state spent a good hour riding all over Windsor Great Park followed by teams of bodyguards — on both four legs and four wheels.On a return trip to the U.S. in 1983, the Queen fulfilled a lifetime\u0027s ambition of touring the West Coast. In Hollywood, Reagan laid on a star-packed lunch for 500. The entertainment included Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope and Perry Como, but the arrangements left some of the local talent rather peeved.\u0027Ronald Reagan was asked who should be at the top table,\u0027 recalls Sir Brian Fall, then private secretary to the British Foreign Secretary, Francis Pym. \u0027Should it be actor friends or political friends? He couldn\u0027t sort it out so he said: \u0027Why don\u0027t we pack it out with Brits in Hollywood?\u0027 \u0027The result was a top table full of British-born stars such as Julie Andrews and Dudley Moore. For some status-obsessed Hollywood egos, it was all too much. The Palace press office, which had played no part in the planning, was left fending off accusations that the Queen was only interested in sitting with fellow Brits.          Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh this afternoon arrived in Washington D.C. where they were greeted by President Eisenhower\u0027I was on the table next door with Julie Andrews\u0027s husband,\u0027 Sir Brian recalls. \u0027He was so ticked off at not being on the right table that he walked off and left a gap.\u0027A few days later the Queen was due to arrive in San Francisco on Britannia, but foul weather persuaded her to fly instead. The Reagans put Air Force Two at her disposal and staff recall a very excited Queen pressing her face against a plane window to enjoy an aerial view of the Golden Gate Bridge.With no Royal Yacht to stay on, the combined power of the White House, the Palace and the personal contacts of the former state governor found the Queen and the Duke last-minute accommodation in the Presidential Suite at the St Francis Hotel, where Nancy Reagan even arranged for works of art from local museums to be rounded up and hung on the walls.\u0027The next question was: where to go for dinner?\u0027 remembers Sir Brian. Again the White House came to the rescue and managed to empty San Francisco\u0027s most famous restaurant, Trader Vic\u0027s, for the night. For the Queen, who had not eaten in a restaurant for 15 years, it was a novel experience, right down to being given a fortune cookie at the end (she read the message and then put it in her handbag).The \u0027special relationship\u0027 was still in robust shape following the first Gulf War as the Queen and Prince Philip arrived to stay with President George H. W. Bush in 1991.However, the state visit got off to an inauspicious start following President Bush\u0027s formal welcome on the White House lawn. After his speech, he was supposed to press a pedal which raised the platform from which the Queen was then going to speak.‘It’s satire, if you don’t like it you don’t have to read...Brits with less than six months on their passport could face...Share this article He forgot to do it and the Queen, being rather shorter, remained invisible to much of the crowd.The moment was encapsulated in the words of NBC\u0027s Jim Miklaszewski: \u0027She\u0027s gone! All I got is a talking hat!\u0027 To this day, Palace officials and diplomats still refer to the state visit as \u0027the talking hat tour\u0027.D uring her stay in Washington, the Queen had her first encounter with the President\u0027s son, George W. Bush, then in charge of the Texas Rangers baseball team. He had been forewarned by his mother not to talk to the Queen, as he could be \u0027mercurial\u0027.The Queen was rather intrigued, particularly since he was wearing cowboy boots etched with the words \u0027God Save The Queen\u0027. At one point she asked him if he was the black sheep of the family.\u0027I guess so,\u0027 replied Bush Junior.\u0027All families have them,\u0027 observed the Queen.\u0027Who\u0027s yours?\u0027 Bush Junior replied, at which point the First Lady, Barbara Bush, intervened with a cry of: \u0027Don\u0027t answer that!\u0027Relations between London and Washington cooled to a more business-like level during the Clinton years, partly because of heated disagreements over the Western response to war in Bosnia.There was no state visit in either direction in that sort of climate, but the Queen fulfilled her now-familiar role as keeper of the \u0027special relationship\u0027.The Clintons might not have had the full royal treatment at Windsor or Buckingham Palace but, in 1994, they were the Queen\u0027s guests for the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of D-Day.Only the Clintons were invited to stay aboard Britannia in Portsmouth ahead of the voyage to France the next day, accompanied by the leaders of all the allied nations and ocean liners packed with veterans.          Queen Elizabeth II stands with US President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, in the Grand Corridor during their visit to Windsor Castle in Berkshire    Andrew Parker Bowles in his army daysSpring 1980, a year before his marriage to Lady Diana Spencer, and the Prince of Wales was on his way to Rhodesia for the hand-over ceremony which would herald its rebirth as independent Zimbabwe.Arrangements for the royal visit had been made by one Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Parker Bowles and he had invited out his wife Camilla who, as the newspapers wasted no time in pointing out, was the Prince\u0027s former girlfriend.\u0027Charles\u0027s old flame lights up darkest Zimbabwe,\u0027 the Daily Mail\u0027s Nigel Dempster reported. However, it was Andrew Parker Bowles whom the Prince should have been most grateful to see.The 40-year-old Army officer had taken it upon himself to double-check every section of the royal itinerary.This included a trip to the Henderson Veterinary Research Station at Mazowe, where the vets were so convinced that they had found a way to tame the notoriously irascible African buffalo, a creature responsible for at least 200 deaths each year, that they were going to invite the Prince to ride one.          Mr Parker Bowles, earlier this monthFortunately for Prince Charles, the gallant Lieutenant Colonel decided to test-ride a buffalo himself, only to be thrown off and gored through the right thigh. A few inches further up and he would have been killed. The royal riding trip at Mazowe was now off. Had the Prince followed the Foreign Office plan, though, he would have been in grave danger. \u0027I always remind him that if it hadn\u0027t gored me and had gored him, things might be very different these days,\u0027 laughs Brigadier Parker Bowles.\u0027He gives me a wry smile and, rightly, takes it quite lightly.\u0027                                                    Adapted from Queen Of The World by Robert Hardman (Century, £25). © Robert Hardman 2018.

It changed course overnight promising to bring even worse devastation to the Carolinas and even parts at Georgia – with the Michigan-sized storm now set to linger for days and cause ‘catastrophic’ flooding with up to four feet of rain and 13-foot storm surges.It is predicted to stall even more off the coast of the Carolinas before scraping down the US east coast and moving inland before the weekend.The new trajectory means the storm will idle at sea for longer creating even heavier and prolonged rains and storm surges for the Carolinas and possibly northern parts of Georgia.At least 25 million residents are at risk from the storm and experts predict its current path could cause up to $170 billion worth of damage, hit up to 759,000 homes and businesses and become the costliest to ever hit the U.S. Hurricane-force winds will reach the Carolina coasts late Thursday or early Friday.

Which is pretty scary odds if you\u0027re the president.\u0027Daniels declined to expand on her comments because of the ongoing legal action and did not explain her theory for how the presidency would end, although she said Trump would not resign because \u0027he\u0027s too arrogant\u0027.The 39-year-old has become a darling of the president\u0027s opponents as she sues to void a 2016 nondisclosure agreement barring her from discussing her alleged affair with Trump in 2006. The president denies having sex with Daniels and is contesting lawsuits brought by Avenatti on her part.She said her decision to take on Trump in public was a reaction to the bullying she had received from him and his associates.            Daniels met Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in July 2006, (pictured) after which they had sex, according to her account\u0027I really just got tired of being bullied and came forward not thinking of how grandiose this was going to become,\u0027 she said. \u0027It was basically just me saying, to quote my attorney Michael Avenatti, \u0027Basta,\u0027 you know, \u0027Enough.\u0027 \u0027You leave me alone or I\u0027m going to tell my truth.\u0027\u0027Then I started to feel sort of in danger and there\u0027s that whole thing about hiding in plain sight. If I\u0027m public, they can\u0027t really do anything to me because everyone would know that it was them.\u0027 Cohen\u0027s guilty plea at a federal court last month to tax evasion and violating campaign finance laws rocked Trump and his inner circle.The plea deal included the admission he had paid Daniels $130,000 worth of hush money at Trump\u0027s instruction with the purpose of swaying the election.Daniels, who also goes by the name Stephanie Clifford, said the news was the best day of her life.\u0027I opened a bottle of wine because I was in Italy. Champagne gives me a headache, so I was drinking wine, which — I am normally not much of a drinker,\u0027 she said.\u0027But the first phone call I got was from one of my bodyguards, Travis, and he was in tears and I was in tears.

As we all know, it is not okay for him to tell me.\u0027Although she insists to having \u0027no regrets\u0027 about her legal battle, Daniels admits she sometimes feels threatened.\u0027People show up, and even if it\u0027s for the right reasons, still a big group of people, even they\u0027re fans, can be quite dangerous,\u0027 she said. \u0027I travel with bodyguards and stuff now and just having them around sort of deters people from trying anything.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/12/21/5012B70700000578-6160303-I_know_this_routine_is_real_Several_years_ago_he_invited_me_to_d-a-2_1536783943134.jpg","title":"PIERS MORGAN Mark Wahlbergs insane daily regime fame costs Id pub","story":"Mark Wahlberg has revealed just how much effort it takes to be him During a Q\u0026ampA with fans on Instagram, the Hollywood actor suddenly unveiled his ‘typical daily schedule’.It read as follows:‘2.30am wake up2.45 prayer time3.15am breakfast3.40-5.15am workout5.30am post-workout meal6.00am shower7.30am golf8.00am snack9.30am cyro chamber recovery10.30am snack11.00am family timemeetingswork calls1.00pm lunch2.00pm meetingwork calls3.00pm pick up kids \u0026amp school3.30pm snack4.00pm workout #25.00pm shower5.30pm dinnerfamily time7.30pm bedtime’Yikes.Just typing all this out was exhausting, let alone contemplating having to actually do it.As Wahlberg’s post promptly went viral, many assumed it must be some kind of joke.Surely nobody could possibly lead such a preposterous self-torturing lifestyle?They can.Wahlberg does.Six days a week, every week, every month, every year.I know this because several years ago he invited me to dinner at his palatial home in Beverly Park, Los Angeles, showed me his massive underground gym (it’s the size of a small aircraft hangar), and told me.          I know this routine is real. Several years ago he invited me to dinner at his palatial home in Beverly Park, Los Angeles, showed me his massive underground gym (it’s the size of a small aircraft hangar), and told me. He only rests on Sundays because he’s a devout Catholic(When he’s away filming, his schedule gets even more insane. He said: ‘I wake at 2.30am, and do an hour’s hard workout from 3am to 4am, with ten-second breaks. Then we drive to a local basketball court and do two-on-two for an hour. I come back to the hotel at 6am and have a plate of chicken and vegetables before heading to the set around 7am. I do 500 sit-ups through the day in my trailer to keep fresh. I finish at 6pm, go back to the hotel and do 45 minutes boxing. Then eat and go to bed by 8pm.’)Wahlberg only rests on Sundays because he’s a devout Catholic and goes to church instead.I asked him why he puts himself through such mind-blowing physical abuse.He was blunt: ‘If you want to be really successful in this business, and stay there, that’s what it takes.’Given that Wahlberg is one of the world’s most bankable film stars (he told me he nicknamed his mansion “Ted” after buying it with the proceeds of that billion dollar movie franchise), he’s clearly reaping very large rewards from the sowing of all that self-punishment.But at what cost?It’s a question I’ve pondered many times over the 30 years I’ve interviewed big stars, many of whom go to ridiculous lengths to preserve their ‘camera-ready’ images.They dye their hair, slice up their faces, Botox their foreheads into creaseless early-embalmment, and lipo-suck their stomachs.And that’s just the normal stuff.For female stars in particular, the pressure to be skinny or youthful drives them to do stupid or dangerous things.Gwyneth Paltrow stings herself with bees. ‘It gets rid of inflammation and scarring,’ she explained, though she later admitted: ‘Man, it’s painful.’Salma Hayek puts guacamole, egg yolk and mayonnaise in her hair, Katie Holmes smears her head in snail slime, Victoria Beckham endures bird poo facials and Kim Kardashian posted pictures of herself undergoing a Vampire Facelift where blood is drawn from a victim’s arm and injected into the face to prevent wrinkles.          For female stars in particular, the pressure to be skinny or youthful drives them to do stupid or dangerous things, like Kim Kardashian undergoing a Vampire FaceliftAnything and everything to prevent the career-wrecking onset of old age.When I interviewed Janet Jackson for CNN, she told me, with undisguised horror on her face, that many famous women she knows eat Kleenex tissue paper to fill their stomachs and deter them from eating food.Imagine wanting fame that much?I can’t – I’d rather use Kleenex to wipe the béarnaise sauce off my lips as I devour a 20lb bone-in rib eye steak while simultaneously guzzling a nice bottle of Chateau Latour.For many actors though, food is not the fuel for life, it’s the professional enemy.When he played an AIDS sufferer in Dallas Buyers Club, Matthew McConaughey lost 47lbs in four months by starving himself on a daily diet of just two egg whites, a bit of chicken, a spoonful of pudding and two Diet Cokes.It won him an Oscar but wow… he’s never getting those months back, is he?          Michael Phelps went five years without taking a single day off training. That\u0027s 20 years of birthdays, weddings, Thanksgivings and Christmas. Is anything worth it?It’s not just actors who do this kind of thing to themselves.Sportsmen all push themselves hard, but the really great ones go to ridiculous lengths to give themselves the edge.Olympic swimming icon Michael Phelps told me he once went five consecutive years without a single day off from training. That’s 1825 days, with 6-8 hours of work a day in and out of the pool.‘Do you know anyone else who has ever done that?’ I asked him.‘No,’ he replied.As with Wahlberg, his motivation was simple: ‘If you want to be the best, you have to be willing to do the things other people aren’t willing to do. I was getting 52 days more training than anyone else I was competing against.’For Phelps, his reward was more Gold medals than anyone in history. But to achieve that, he sacrificed 20 years of partying with friends and family events like birthdays, weddings, Thanksgivings and Christmas.Is ANYTHING really worth that?Mark Wahlberg is one of the most normal big stars I know he’s very happily married with four children, has the same circle of loyal friends he’s had since he was a young man, and suffers from none of the false affectations or regular outbursts of outrageous ego that so often infest a major celebrity.          Mark Wahlberg is one of the most normal big stars I know he’s happily married with four kids, shown here last Christmas, has the same circle of loyal friends he’s had since he was youngFrom my experience, he’s a regular down-to-earth guy (albeit one who matured from a violent, troublesome, criminal upbringing) whose talent and work ethic has brought him massive success, fame and wealth.But I couldn’t do what he does every day, could you?Don’t get me wrong: I want fame, and I’ve had a reasonably pleasurable taste of it.It’s fun, exciting and opens up all sorts of doors – like to first class plane cabins, brand new Aston Martins and the best restaurants in towns.But for me, there’s a limit to just how much I want it, and just how far I’m prepared to sweat for it.My regime for today for example will end up something like this:4.45am wake up and head to Good Morning Britain’s TV studios in London5.30am 1st breakfast6-8.30am sit at a desk arguing with people.9am 2nd breakfast10am spinning class or swim (if I can be bothered..)11am sleep12pm argue with people on Twitter1pm lunch2pm sit at a desk writing argumentative columns for Daily Mail.5pm argue with people on Twitter about my columns6pm pub for a pint7pm dinner8pm watch TV9.45pm sleep          My daily regime\u0027s plus side is that it involves very little physical hard work, and I think I can also legitimately claim to be a world-class arguer. But it doesn\u0027t pay as well as The plus side is that it involves very little physical hard work, and I think I can also legitimately claim to be a world-class arguer.The down side is that this doesn’t pay quite as well as being a movie superstar or record-breaking Olympic Gold medal champion.But I know in my heart I just don’t have what it takes to be a Phelps or Mark Wahlberg (before the inevitable mockery lights up for even attempting to put myself in the same celebrity bracket as him, let me remind you that I’ve been in eight movies which have grossed $1.8 billion, including Entourage in which I had a bigger part than Mr Wahlberg..)I simply don’t want to sweat that much, well not unless it includes the kind of sweat you get with a ferocious hangover after a fantastic party.Nor do I want to sting myself with bees, pay a plastic surgeon a small fortune to chop off my jowls, or live off diet cokes and egg whites.The bottom line is this: I like and admire Mark Wahlberg, but having seen his daily schedule, I have zero desire to actually be him.Frankly, if that’s what fame costs – I ain’t paying. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/12/15/50132F4100000578-0-image-m-26_1536763198934.jpg","title":"South Carolina slave descendants used riding storms","story":"John Brown stands behind a fence for his cows outside his home on St. Helena Island, South Carolina, on Tuesday.

But the so-called Sea Islands Hurricane of 1893 devastated the area after rolling ashore in Savannah, Georgia, and killed an estimated 2,000 people.Hurricane Florence is set to bring churning 83ft waves, four feet of rain, a 13-foot storm surge and $170 billion worth of destruction when it hits on Thursday night.

A giant live oak uprooted by the storm remains intact across the street from Brown\u0027s home.\u0027If my job didn\u0027t require me to stay, I\u0027d be out of here in a heartbeat,\u0027 Brown said after giving fresh water to his four cows Tuesday. \u0027I think most of the older ones, they\u0027re kind of stubborn.

Pictured is a hurricane shelter at Trask Middle School in North Carolina on Tuesday Things calmed down Tuesday when the order was lifted for Beaufort County, though some local restaurants and businesses stayed closed.Florence\u0027s track remained uncertain Wednesday. The National Hurricane Center said the storm is expected to slow as it moves toward the Carolinas and could even change direction before coming ashore.Bertha Bradley wasn\u0027t worrying. She and her husband grew up on St. Helena Island and own Bradley\u0027s Seafood, a small cinderblock shop where they sell shrimp, flounder and whiting, all caught by their son.Bradley said she has never favored evacuating ahead of hurricanes, in part because her great-grandmother never did. Bradley and her husband missed Gracie in 1959 because they were in Savannah after getting married. One subsequent storm, she\u0027s not sure which one, scared them enough to get them to leave the island.But the traffic, she said, was awful.\u0027I said, \u0027Why get on the road like this?

I\u0027m going to see what happens\u0027.Some believed that she was saying she wouldn\u0027t vote at all, or even that she would vote for Trump.           After reading the interview, Messing tweeted: \u0027Susan Sarandon muses that Trump presidency would be better for the country than Hillary.

It’s a big part of what led me to wanting another child.’IVF treatment is notoriously expensive, but the soon-to-be mother-of-seven has used the money left to her by her late mother, Pauline Smith, to have the treatment.The process began in April, when she received hormone injections at home before flying to Cyprus.Although Mrs Britten told friends that she was going on holiday, she actually went to the private Kolan British IVF Center where her eggs were extracted, fertilised by Mr Britten’s sperm and then implanted back into the 50-year-old’s womb.

I could have said far worse.\u0027I stand by telling his kids who their father really is.\u0027Bone has been protesting since the 1980s and is a publisher with class activist publications, Class War and The Bristolian.Class War became a class movement as well as a newspaper, which at its height sold 15,000 copies weekly and supported striking miners, dockers, print workers and demos including the Brixton Riots of 1981, before the publication was launched.Bone went on Bash the Rich marches (Bash the Rich is also the title of his autobiography). Just a decade ago he advocated violence to overthrow the state.While still a weekly paper, Class War dubbed itself \u0027Britain\u0027s most unruly tabloid\u0027.After Prince William\u0027s birth in September 1984 it carried a front page picture of him with the headline \u0027Another f***ing royal parasite\u0027.Another front page carried an image of Margaret Thatcher with a hatchet buried in her head. When the paper folded, it carried on as a pressure group.Bone admits to having a working class hatred for the rich as his own father was a butler. He lived in Grenfell from 1983-1986 and knew several residents who were caught up in the fire there where 72 people died.He went on to protest outside The Shard when Grenfell residents weren\u0027t being re-housed  as there were 10 £50m empty luxury flats inside the state-of-the-art tower.Bone was taken to the High Court by Qatari royal family, owner of The Shard, in February this year to stop his protests before their lawyers withdrew their threat of an injunction against him.In 2006 he told The Guardian newspaper that violence was key, saying: \u0027Not (attacking someone) inidually, but if you\u0027re fighting back as a mob against a particular thing like the poll tax or the Iraq War (then) yes.. If the rich or the ruling class or the police are defending their interests, they deserve everything that\u0027s coming to them.\u0027And in June he posted on his own Facebook page in regards to Donald Trump\u0027s visit: \u0027Spend the day idling and drinking around Bond Street New Bond street...……..enter shops......handle the goods....be insolent to the rich... insolence comrades...let insolence win the day.\u0027                             "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/03/501AC68D00000578-0-image-a-60_1536805882748.jpg","title":"Cool surfer makes COCKTAIL riding waves ice bucket board","story":"    The slick wake-boarder coolly served up the drink while surfing on a lake in SwitzerlandSalt Lake PRETTY!

That is what we must do.\u0027   At a rally in 2006, Mr Murray read out a message sent to him by Ali Fayad, a Ukrainian arms dealer and senior Hezbollah terror chief, who was jailed in 2014 in the US for funding terror          People at the rally (pictured, which before Mr Fayad was convicted, carried banners saying \u0027victory to the intifada\u0027 and \u0027we are all Hezbollah\u0027 and waved the communist flag          Mr Corbyn has come under intense pressure since it was revealed that two of his closest aides have been working in Parliament for months without security clearance and faces a probeIn a report on the 2006 march, where 20,000 people are said to have attended, the Socialist party newspaper wrote: \u0027Left-wing leading members of the Stop the War Coalition, including George Galloway and Andrew Murray, not only failed to raise socialist ideas but also expressed uncritical support for the Islamist Hamas and Hezbollah.\u0027 A speech was also made by activist and long-term Corbyn ally Azzam Tamimi, who said he wanted to blow himself up in a suicide attack. \u0027Sacrificing myself for Palestine is a noble cause,\u0027 he told the BBC. \u0027It is the straight way to pleasing my God and I would do it if I had the opportunity.\u0027 Hezbollah is an Iran-backed Shia militia in Lebanon that was set up in the early 1980s. Its followers use the Hitler salute and has carried out terror attacks against Jews both in Israel and worldwide. Britain views its military wing as a terrorist entity. Mr Corbyn is facing a probe over claims that a second aide has also been working in Parliament without security clearance.His Private Secretary, Iram Awan, a British-born pro-Palestinian activist was not granted full security passes but continued to work for the Labour leader in Parliament for nine months using a visitor\u0027s pass.Mr Corbyn is under intense pressure because every staffer in Parliament requires a Commons pass and is required to undergo a counter-terrorist check (CTC) into their background and associates. Mr Murray is the grandson of a Tory MP and was educated at a £32,000-a-year public school. He  appears in Debrett\u0027s Peerage, the guide to Britain\u0027s aristocracy. His full moniker is Andrew Drummond-Murray of Mastrick.His father, Peter Drummond-Murray of Mastrick, was a banker and stockbroker from an old Scottish family. His mother, Barbara, was the daughter of Lord Rankeillour, a Conservative MP who later became Governor of Madras in India.            Corbyn\u0027s Private Secretary Iram Awan (pictured with Corbyn), a British-born national, has also been working, this time for nine months, in Parliament using a visitor\u0027s pass, which is against the rulesMr Murray was a member of Britain\u0027s communist party until 2016 and has praised Stalin and North Korea. On one occasion, he reportedly said: \u0027Against imperialists, we are all Stalinists\u0027. On another, he pledged \u0027solidarity\u0027 with the North Korean regime. It normally takes a matter of weeks for Parliamentary passes to be processed. However, Mr Murray and Miss Awan have not yet had their application approved despite taking up the role with the Labour leader many months ago. Commons authorities are now investigating whether Parliamentary rules have been broken by Mr Corbyn\u0027s office in allowing them to work in Parliament. Tory MPs have also written to the Serjeant-at-Arms, who is responsible for order and security in the Commons, to demand he also investigates the affair. Tory Party chairman Brandon Lewis said last night: \u0027This clear breach of security not only puts Parliament at risk, it also raises serious questions about Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s judgment and integrity.\u0027 Tory MP Leo Docherty added: \u0027We all know how the security of Parliament is a matter of the utmost importance and Jeremy Corbyn has put this at risk.\u0027 Commons authorities were facing questions last night about the apparent breach of basic security rules.A Labour spokesman said: \u0027We do not comment on staffing matters.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/10/501E52CA00000578-6163261-image-a-9_1536831740482.jpg","title":"Stunning pictures emerge Herring girls helped Britains fishing industry thrive","story":"    These striking images show the work of \u0027Herring Girls\u0027 in Great Yarmouth in Norfolk during the 1920s          Women were sorted into groups who either gutted the herring over barrels, pictured, or salted the fish          The work was grueling, but the women travelled down from the highlands of Scotland and the Hebridean islands to take advantage of the bounty          The \u0027herring girls\u0027 would have to bind their fingers to prevent them being cut by the sharp knives they used while gutting the fishEvery year in the autumn vast shoals of herring came to feed around 30 miles off the coast in the area - and with them came jobs, with many women coming down from the highlands of Scotland and the Hebridean islands to take advantage of the bounty.\u0027Herring girls\u0027 looked forward to the chance to earn some money and to travel, despite the grueling work that began very early in the day.

The day was celebrated by all the citizens who were invited with many days of drinking, feasting and horse races.Bustle reported that despite starting in October, the celebrations were moved to an earlier date so that it could be celebrated in better weather conditions. Now, starting in September, the last weekend is still usually held in October.Oktoberfest was actually a non-alcoholic event at first and what is now the largest beer drinking festival in the world, did not serve alcohol at the festival itself, but was sold outside the fairgrounds. Now, over 7.5 million litres of beer are consumed every year.The 16-day event is opened by the Mayor of Munich who taps the first keg and declares ‘O’ zapft is!’, which can be roughly translated to ‘it’s tapped’ in English. The first person that drinks is traditionally the Minister-President of the State of Bavaria and only after that, visitors can celebrate.Alongside beer, gingerbread cookies with sweet messages called Lebkuchen hearts are also consumed.           Munich\u0027s deputy mayor Josef Schmid poses for  Oktoberfest 2016 with a Lebkuchen heartThe Telegraph reported that in the past 10 years, Oktoberfest has attracted around six million visitors a year, who all make their way through thousands of sausages, chickens and pretzels.In addition to the drinking and feasting, parades are held alongside a number of fairground rides with many dressing traditional Bavarian garb. With the event being so popular, it is advised that attendees book accommodation and transport are booked well in advance on this website.Oktoberfest 2018Oktoberfest 2018 will start on Saturday, September 22 and go on until October 7, according to Munich’s official event website. While entry to the tents is free, visitors will have to pay for beer, fairground attractions and whatever they purchase at the stalls.Die WiesnThe Munich locals refer to Oktoberfest as ‘die Wiesn’ because of its location, Theresienwiese, which was named after the Princess Therese von Sachsen-Hildburghausen.The highlight of this event is the Costume and Riflemen’s Parade, which happens on the first Wiesn Sunday every year. In 2018, it will be held on Sunday, September 23 and on the following Sunday, an open-air big band concert is held.Other events include the Parade of Oktoberfest Landlords and Breweries, the Oktoberfest Mass or the Böllerschießen, which is a handheld cannon salute in front of the Bavaria statue.          Kim Kardashian visits the Oktoberfest 2010 at the Hippodrom tent at TheresienwieseOktoberfest MunichTheresienwiese is located a short tram ride away from Munich and is celebrated in a number of tents, as Ludwig and Therese did in 1810. However, the tents that are used today have colourful facades, long wooden tables and benches, holding up to 10,000 visitors.About 70 percent of these visitors are from Bavaria itself and 15 percent from other parts of Germany, but there are a large number of people from abroad also, who tend to be found at the Hofbräu tent.Visitors are also encouraged to visit the other 13 tents, such as the Hackerbräu, which is decked out in Bavarian blue and white and the Winzerer Fähndl, that has its own beer garden.The Augustiner Festhalle is popular with families, particularly on Tuesdays and the largest tent is the 10,000-seater Schottenhamel, where the first beer of the season is poured. The smallest is the Glöckle Wirt, which has room for just 98 people and its walls are covered with traditional instruments, cooking utensils and paintings.Oktoberfest outfitsMany opt to wear lederhosen or dirndl, the traditional Bavarian dress with full skirt, apron and tight bodice. However, many have called into question whether or not ‘sexy’ versions of the dirndl should be worn and if this is cultural appropriation, as reported by The Guardian.Oktoberfest beerOktoberfest regulation states that only beer from Munich’s six breweries: Paulaner, Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr, Augustiner, Hofbräu, and Löwenbräu can be served and like other German brews, Oktoberfest beers must pass the ‘purity’ law, or Reinheitsgebot, passed in 1516 to ensure quality.Oktoberfest beer is served in one-litre glasses and is priced at around  10 Euros. For those who are not partial to beer, there is also a wine tent called the Weinzelt, where visitors can choose from more than 15 different variations.Henry Cavill net worth: Superman star\u0027s wealth revealed as actor announces he\u0027s leaving DC franchiseRoald Dahl Day 2018: What is it?

Around a third (34 per cent) of 18 to 24 year-olds were smokers in 2000, but this fell to 23 per cent in 2017.Tory infighting escalates as \u0027new generation\u0027 of MPs demands...Share this articleThe dramatic decline has coincided with the ban on smoking indoors, which came into force in July 2007, and the rise of electronic cigarettes which some people use to try to kick the habit.Although the downward trend has undergone a sudden reversal in the past year - increasing from 18 per cent in 2016 to 23 per cent last year. The sudden uptick comes amid warnings that some young people are being lured into smoking by electronic cigarettes - which come in a variety of fruity flavours.The revelations come as the American authorities announced they could ban the sale of fruity e cigarette flavours in a bid to stop the devices appealing to youngsters.Today\u0027s ONS figures also show that 18 year-olds spend less time socialising and having fun with their friends than they used to.In the year 2000, 18 year-olds spent on average nearly an hour and a half (88 minutes) hanging out with their friends.But this has fallen to just over an hour (61 minutes) in the year 2015, the figures show.           The ONS said that youngsters are spending more time glued to their screens or playing computer games than they used to, and less time socialising with their friends Rather than getting out of the house and socialising, 18 year-olds are spending far more time glued to their computer screans.So, while in 2000 they spent on average 12 minutes a day \u0027computing\u0027  this has grown massively to nearly 29 minutes in 2015.And while 18 year-olds used to just spend 11 minutes a day on \u0027games and computer games\u0027 this has soared to nearly 42 minutes.The figures come amid concerns that young people are spending far too long on their computers and smart phones on Facebook and Snapchat.ONS said: \u0027The internet was a very different place at the start of the century – with no Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, YouTube or Instagram – and no smartphones or tablets to access it. \u0027The biggest changes to how 18-year-olds spend their time may be driven in part by the rise of digital technology.\u0027Time 18-year-olds spent socialising, which includes meeting friends and family, visiting pubs or cafes, or talking on the phone, declined by 27 minutes per day between 2000 to 2001 and 2014 to 2015.\u0027Time spent computing, which includes using social media, went up by 17 minutes per day, while 18-year-olds spent an additional 31 minutes playing games including computer games. \u0027There was also a rise in the amount of time spent on sport and exercise, up by 8 minutes per day.

I know this routine is real. Several years ago he invited me to dinner at his palatial home in Beverly Park, Los Angeles, showed me his massive underground gym (it’s the size of a small aircraft hangar), and told me. He only rests on Sundays because he’s a devout Catholic(When he’s away filming, his schedule gets even more insane. He said: ‘I wake at 2.30am, and do an hour’s hard workout from 3am to 4am, with ten-second breaks. Then we drive to a local basketball court and do two-on-two for an hour. I come back to the hotel at 6am and have a plate of chicken and vegetables before heading to the set around 7am. I do 500 sit-ups through the day in my trailer to keep fresh. I finish at 6pm, go back to the hotel and do 45 minutes boxing. Then eat and go to bed by 8pm.’)Wahlberg only rests on Sundays because he’s a devout Catholic and goes to church instead.I asked him why he puts himself through such mind-blowing physical abuse.He was blunt: ‘If you want to be really successful in this business, and stay there, that’s what it takes.’Given that Wahlberg is one of the world’s most bankable film stars (he told me he nicknamed his mansion “Ted” after buying it with the proceeds of that billion dollar movie franchise), he’s clearly reaping very large rewards from the sowing of all that self-punishment.But at what cost?It’s a question I’ve pondered many times over the 30 years I’ve interviewed big stars, many of whom go to ridiculous lengths to preserve their ‘camera-ready’ images.They dye their hair, slice up their faces, Botox their foreheads into creaseless early-embalmment, and lipo-suck their stomachs.And that’s just the normal stuff.For female stars in particular, the pressure to be skinny or youthful drives them to do stupid or dangerous things.Gwyneth Paltrow stings herself with bees. ‘It gets rid of inflammation and scarring,’ she explained, though she later admitted: ‘Man, it’s painful.’Salma Hayek puts guacamole, egg yolk and mayonnaise in her hair, Katie Holmes smears her head in snail slime, Victoria Beckham endures bird poo facials and Kim Kardashian posted pictures of herself undergoing a Vampire Facelift where blood is drawn from a victim’s arm and injected into the face to prevent wrinkles.          For female stars in particular, the pressure to be skinny or youthful drives them to do stupid or dangerous things, like Kim Kardashian undergoing a Vampire FaceliftAnything and everything to prevent the career-wrecking onset of old age.When I interviewed Janet Jackson for CNN, she told me, with undisguised horror on her face, that many famous women she knows eat Kleenex tissue paper to fill their stomachs and deter them from eating food.Imagine wanting fame that much?I can’t – I’d rather use Kleenex to wipe the béarnaise sauce off my lips as I devour a 20lb bone-in rib eye steak while simultaneously guzzling a nice bottle of Chateau Latour.For many actors though, food is not the fuel for life, it’s the professional enemy.When he played an AIDS sufferer in Dallas Buyers Club, Matthew McConaughey lost 47lbs in four months by starving himself on a daily diet of just two egg whites, a bit of chicken, a spoonful of pudding and two Diet Cokes.It won him an Oscar but wow… he’s never getting those months back, is he?          Michael Phelps went five years without taking a single day off training. That\u0027s 20 years of birthdays, weddings, Thanksgivings and Christmas. Is anything worth it?It’s not just actors who do this kind of thing to themselves.Sportsmen all push themselves hard, but the really great ones go to ridiculous lengths to give themselves the edge.Olympic swimming icon Michael Phelps told me he once went five consecutive years without a single day off from training. That’s 1825 days, with 6-8 hours of work a day in and out of the pool.‘Do you know anyone else who has ever done that?’ I asked him.‘No,’ he replied.As with Wahlberg, his motivation was simple: ‘If you want to be the best, you have to be willing to do the things other people aren’t willing to do. I was getting 52 days more training than anyone else I was competing against.’For Phelps, his reward was more Gold medals than anyone in history. But to achieve that, he sacrificed 20 years of partying with friends and family events like birthdays, weddings, Thanksgivings and Christmas.Is ANYTHING really worth that?Mark Wahlberg is one of the most normal big stars I know he’s very happily married with four children, has the same circle of loyal friends he’s had since he was a young man, and suffers from none of the false affectations or regular outbursts of outrageous ego that so often infest a major celebrity.          Mark Wahlberg is one of the most normal big stars I know he’s happily married with four kids, shown here last Christmas, has the same circle of loyal friends he’s had since he was youngFrom my experience, he’s a regular down-to-earth guy (albeit one who matured from a violent, troublesome, criminal upbringing) whose talent and work ethic has brought him massive success, fame and wealth.But I couldn’t do what he does every day, could you?Don’t get me wrong: I want fame, and I’ve had a reasonably pleasurable taste of it.It’s fun, exciting and opens up all sorts of doors – like to first class plane cabins, brand new Aston Martins and the best restaurants in towns.But for me, there’s a limit to just how much I want it, and just how far I’m prepared to sweat for it.My regime for today for example will end up something like this:4.45am wake up and head to Good Morning Britain’s TV studios in London5.30am 1st breakfast6-8.30am sit at a desk arguing with people.9am 2nd breakfast10am spinning class or swim (if I can be bothered..)11am sleep12pm argue with people on Twitter1pm lunch2pm sit at a desk writing argumentative columns for Daily Mail.5pm argue with people on Twitter about my columns6pm pub for a pint7pm dinner8pm watch TV9.45pm sleep          My daily regime\u0027s plus side is that it involves very little physical hard work, and I think I can also legitimately claim to be a world-class arguer. But it doesn\u0027t pay as well as The plus side is that it involves very little physical hard work, and I think I can also legitimately claim to be a world-class arguer.The down side is that this doesn’t pay quite as well as being a movie superstar or record-breaking Olympic Gold medal champion.But I know in my heart I just don’t have what it takes to be a Phelps or Mark Wahlberg (before the inevitable mockery lights up for even attempting to put myself in the same celebrity bracket as him, let me remind you that I’ve been in eight movies which have grossed $1.8 billion, including Entourage in which I had a bigger part than Mr Wahlberg..)I simply don’t want to sweat that much, well not unless it includes the kind of sweat you get with a ferocious hangover after a fantastic party.Nor do I want to sting myself with bees, pay a plastic surgeon a small fortune to chop off my jowls, or live off diet cokes and egg whites.The bottom line is this: I like and admire Mark Wahlberg, but having seen his daily schedule, I have zero desire to actually be him.Frankly, if that’s what fame costs – I ain’t paying. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/12/15/50132F4100000578-0-image-m-26_1536763198934.jpg","title":"South Carolina slave descendants used riding storms","story":"John Brown stands behind a fence for his cows outside his home on St. Helena Island, South Carolina, on Tuesday.

Pictured on May 16, 2013  Sapelo Island (pictured in 2013) has been repeatedly lashed by hurricanes, and is vulnerable to storm surges coming in from the sea Emory Campbell, a Gullah descendant and scholar, recalled riding as a boy in a neighbor\u0027s old cart on Hilton Head Island as Hurricane Gracie struck in 1959 and tore the roof off a hotel.\u0027We saw some remnants of hurricanes here when I was growing up,\u0027 Campbell said. \u0027The wind would blow, you\u0027d put some tin up against the window, but you wouldn\u0027t know that much except for the scratchy sounds on the radio coming out of Savannah.\u0027Hurricane Matthew smashed and toppled trees across surrounding Beaufort County in 2016 but largely spared the modest ranch houses, bungalows and mobile homes of St. Helena Island.John Brown, 54, said he spent two weeks after Matthew cutting up fallen trees with a chain saw in his job for a municipal public works department. A giant live oak uprooted by the storm remains intact across the street from Brown\u0027s home.\u0027If my job didn\u0027t require me to stay, I\u0027d be out of here in a heartbeat,\u0027 Brown said after giving fresh water to his four cows Tuesday. \u0027I think most of the older ones, they\u0027re kind of stubborn. But the younger ones, not so much.\u0027St Helena residents said people started filling up gas cans and buying supplies Monday when the governor ordered evacuations for the entire South Carolina coast.           People in the Carolinas have been urged to evacuate their homes before the storm hits. Pictured is a hurricane shelter at Trask Middle School in North Carolina on Tuesday Things calmed down Tuesday when the order was lifted for Beaufort County, though some local restaurants and businesses stayed closed.Florence\u0027s track remained uncertain Wednesday. The National Hurricane Center said the storm is expected to slow as it moves toward the Carolinas and could even change direction before coming ashore.Bertha Bradley wasn\u0027t worrying. She and her husband grew up on St. Helena Island and own Bradley\u0027s Seafood, a small cinderblock shop where they sell shrimp, flounder and whiting, all caught by their son.Bradley said she has never favored evacuating ahead of hurricanes, in part because her great-grandmother never did. Bradley and her husband missed Gracie in 1959 because they were in Savannah after getting married. One subsequent storm, she\u0027s not sure which one, scared them enough to get them to leave the island.But the traffic, she said, was awful.\u0027I said, \u0027Why get on the road like this? I\u0027m going to get killed on the road,\u0027\u0027 Bradley said. \u0027I should stay in my house, where I have water and food. If God\u0027s coming for you, you can\u0027t run from him.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/00/4FE9B4EE00000578-0-Umpires_are_mad_at_governing_body_officials_who_backed_up_star_S-a-11_1536793480987.jpg","title":"JANET STREET PORTER Rees Moggs nanny botherer nasty piece work","story":"    Ian Bone (right), a 71 year-old professional protester, took class war to a new low this week, shouting abuse at Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027s children and an elderly woman who\u0027s worked for his family for 51 years          Serena Williams yells at chair umpire Carlos Ramos in the women\u0027s final against Naomi Osaka To be honest the kids (immaculately turned out in posh school uniforms) and Nanny Crook in her sensible shoes seemed totally bemused by the motley crew protesting six feet from their doorstep.Nanny Crook told Mr Bone she was \u0027very happy\u0027 and her boss was \u0027wonderful\u0027.Mr Bone was roundly condemned on all sides, from the Prime Minister to the Archbishop of Canterbury and parliamentarians of all persuasions. One MP reckoned that the kids would be \u0027marked forever\u0027.The Home Secretary said it was \u0027absolutely disgraceful\u0027. Mr Rees-Mogg took a rather different line, telling journalists \u0027I wouldn\u0027t get too excited about it…it wasn\u0027t terribly well organised, or terribly serious….we are a free country, they weren\u0027t violent…not everybody is going to like me\u0027.Game, set and match to Rees Mogg and Nanny Crook.Contrast Mr Bone\u0027s raging in a London street with events at the US Open Women\u0027s final last weekend.The most successful female sportswoman of all time had a huge tantrum in front of a sold-out stadium, smashing her racquet, calling the umpire a liar and a thief - all of which cost her valuable penalty points and the loss of a game.          Furious Williams argues with RamosIn the ensuing furore, we seemed to forget that another woman - Japan\u0027s Naomi Osaka - won her first Grand Slam title - although she spent most of the awards ceremony head down, in tears.Serena\u0027s meltdown was justified by tennis legend Billie Jean King and former US Open runner up Victoria Azarenka, who agreed that the umpire was sexist and would not have treated a male player in the same way.Billie Jean tweeted \u0027when a woman is emotional, she\u0027s \u0027hysterical\u0027 and she\u0027s penalised for it. When a man does the same, he\u0027s outspoken \u0026amp there are no repercussions. Thank you @serenawilliams for calling out this double standard.\u0027Williams herself tweeted to say she was just expressing strong emotions, and that her rage might enable other women to feel free to do that.One columnist has suggested that Serena\u0027s meltdown was partly because her child is almost a year old, and that\u0027s affected her brain, making her slightly bonkers, and pulled in two directions.I disagree - Serena was out to win her 24th Grand Slam title, to make history, and she went off the rails when her master plan was derailed (Osaka won the first set) because she couldn\u0027t control her emotions.By saying she was a feminist, telling the umpire \u0027I\u0027m here fighting for women\u0027s rights and for women\u0027s equality…and for my daughter\u0027, she was not empowering other women.Unfortunately, she crossed the line from sportsmanship (or sportspersonship) into brat - surely she could have made her point without the racquet smashing, the shouting?    Class activists launched an extraordinary tirade at Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027s children – including his six-year-old son – telling them their daddy is a \u0027totally horrible person\u0027Yes, her meltdown will make officials more careful in future, but is this how women should behave to get their rights? Do we have to fight as dirty as men do? I hate losing an argument, but when I start ranting and my voice cracks (as Serena\u0027s did) I know that I have let myself down. Steely self-control gets you further in the end.Mr Bone is not a likeable inidual by any stretch of the imagination - but he is entitled to stage a demonstration for worker\u0027s rights and to express his left wing opinions, even if it happens right outside a posh bloke\u0027s home in Mayfair.JANET STREET-PORTER: Kim, Coleen and me and how an...\u0027Mum you can\u0027t do this, he\u0027s going to kill you too\u0027:...Share this articleI\u0027m not a fan of Rees-Mogg, with his antiquated view on birth control (he\u0027s a devout Catholic) and Brexit (he\u0027s rabidly pro-Brexit, determined to lead his party no matter what it takes), but I find his presence a bit of light relief in the dreary hinterland of British parliamentarians. Mostly, they parrot the party line, spending their time tweeting and being politically correct, not daring to step out of line for fear of demotion.Britain hasn\u0027t banned free speech (yet), and if Mr Bone finds the curiously faux-fogey Jacob Rees-Mogg a disgusting example of class and privilege and everything that is wrong with British society, fair enough.          One of the three violations Ramos called on Williams was for racket abuse, after the superstar smashed her racket (above) on the court in reaction to losing a gameAs a student in London, I regularly went on anti-war protests, even chucking plastic bags of butcher\u0027s blood at police horses and calling their riders \u0027pigs\u0027.In the late 1960\u0027s thousands of us participated in college sit-ins and demonstrations against nuclear war. In some ways, Mr Bone and his Class War colleagues are a throwback to these glorious days of anarchic protest. He thinks that people should be banned from going to Eton, and that the working class should be occupying the £10 million empty flats in London\u0027s Shard.Dream on!His Class War newspaper has seen it\u0027s circulation dwindle, even though they\u0027ve come up with some publicity-grabbing stunts, like the front page headline after the birth of Prince William - \u0027Another F*****g royal parasite\u0027.Although the rant at the Rees-Mogg nanny was distasteful, Bone has a point. The number of poor people working as slaves in domestic households in Britain has risen sharply in recent years - but they are just as likely to be trapped in middle class homes as obvious toffs like Mr R-M. And if Nanny Crook didn\u0027t like her pay and conditions, what\u0027s she still doing wiping bottoms after 71 years?But if on the off-chance she has had enough of Tory high life she might bring her child-minding skills to help multi-millionaire Serena Williams control her tantrums.

It’s a big part of what led me to wanting another child.’IVF treatment is notoriously expensive, but the soon-to-be mother-of-seven has used the money left to her by her late mother, Pauline Smith, to have the treatment.The process began in April, when she received hormone injections at home before flying to Cyprus.Although Mrs Britten told friends that she was going on holiday, she actually went to the private Kolan British IVF Center where her eggs were extracted, fertilised by Mr Britten’s sperm and then implanted back into the 50-year-old’s womb.

Each illustrates or explores the theme: Extravaganza – Out of the Ordinary.The festival is enlivened by the inventive staging of its exhibits. Works of both established and emerging photographers are displayed in an astonishing variety of unconventional venues and locations.A railway platform, a phone booth, a church, a dilapidated hardware shop, even the waters of Lake Geneva serve to showcase the pictures.Photography studios, by Antonina Gugala.Gugala’s project exploring Warsaw’s portrait businesses is installed adjacent to Vevey’s sole remaining, and soon-to-close, photo studio.For Stefano Stoll, the festival’s director, such theatricality helps encourage a broad public engagement with the work, which he insists must be readily comprehensible. Furthermore, he hopes that the use of locations around the town will add layers of meaning to the pictures, whether these are playful, serious or ironic. Thus placing a photograph of an airborne whale high above viewers’ heads, or photographs of the pages of Frank Sinatra’s phonebook on the inside of a phonebooth, or pictures of detention cells behind the bars of a former prison, adds to the experience.Arnold Odermattdocumented the daily life of his colleagues in the Swiss police force for more than 40 years.

While waiting at the lights motorists can take a moment to enjoy the work of a one-time chief of transport police.Jun Ahn’s dizzying self-portraits on skyscrapers and window ledges show the artist pushing herself to a literal limit. However she might appear, she says she is not without fear. Ahn says: “Some media described me as a fearless artist, but I’m really not that. I really have a fear and this is about that fear and how the photography medium subverts the context of the fear.” Her work is installed in the Hôtel des Trois Couronnes, where she appears poised on a window ledge, and perched on one of its balconies.Jono Rotman’s unnerving portraits are of members of New Zealand’s Mongrel Mob, an infamous gang of predominantly Maori bikers. Over a 10-year period Rotman established a relationship with them marked by trust and confidence. Their reputation for violence, adoption of nationalistic symbols, and indeed their appearance, guarantee their marginal status in New Zealand. In Vevey their pictures are on show in the bustling Grande Place, the heart of civic life.Castore’s work focuses on an elderly lady and her brother, Ewa and Piotr, whom he befriended in Kraków. Though the two were leading isolated, lives in a run-down apartment, even lacking hot water, it emerged that they had once enjoyed a wealthy upbringing. Castore juxtaposes his portraiture with earlier pictures from Ewa’s own collection. They are displayed in an appropriately neglected former hardware shop.Erik Kessels, tireless champion of vernacular photography, is exhibiting some 2,000 album covers inside Église Sainte-Claire.

Jobs denied paternity, and declared in a deposition that he was sterile. After a DNA test showed they were in fact father and daughter, he agreed to pay her mother, Chrisann Brennan, $500 a month. A few days later, Apple became a public company and Jobs’s net worth shot up overnight to $200m.Relating this tale in her memoir, Brennan-Jobs doesn’t berate or make excuses for her father. As the founder of NeXT and co-founder of Apple, Jobs enjoyed enormous power in his working life. At home, he exerted power by withholding things: money, conversation, affection. Nowadays his behaviour would be seen as abusive, but, for Brennan-Jobs, it was normal. It was simply what her father did.The title of this memoir comes from Jobs’s nickname for his daughter, a term of endearment that demonstrated he was capable of warmth when the mood took him. He was mostly absent until she was eight, when he began dropping by her mother’s house in Palo Alto to take Lisa roller-skating. Grateful as she was for his attention, she remained uncomfortable in his presence, fearful of irritating him or overstepping the mark. Throughout the book, she depicts herself as an outsider whose relationship with her dad was characterised by confusion and shame. “For him,” she says, “I was a blot on a spectacular ascent, as our story did not fit with the narrative of greatness and virtue he might have wanted for himself. My existence ruined his streak.”Small Fry isn’t about eliciting sympathy or seeking revenge. Instead she tries to get to the bottom of a relationship mired in awkwardness and unpredictability. In exposing her father’s more unpleasant traits, her language betrays her trepidation. Not given to drama or sentimentality, it is sparse though precise. The more shocking the anecdote, the more economical her description, though her wounds are clear.There are only fleeting references to Jobs’s working life. This is, after all, Brennan-Jobs’s memoir, not a biography of her father. As well aschronicling her early life, it is a lesson in how our identity and self-esteem are moulded by those charged with the task of raising us. Rejection and frustration are running themes.Brennan-Jobs’s mother is depicted as nurturing, creative and free spirited but also given to frightening outpourings of bitterness at their circumstances. “I don’t want this life,” she once screamed in the car in front of her four-year-old daughter. “I want out. I’m sick of living.” While Jobs could be funny and perceptive, more often he was severe and condescending. Long after his paternity was proven, he would tell people that Lisa wasn’t really his child, and that his existence in her life was an act of charity. He would decide not to pay for things at the last minute, walking out of restaurants without paying the bill, and told his daughter, then nine, that she would never get a penny from him.In her teens, as her relationship with her mother became fractious, he invited her to live with him and his wife, Laurene, and their baby son, on the condition that she didn’t see or speak to Chrisann for six months. Brennan-Jobs hoped that living with him would allow her to get to know him better, which in many ways it did. After years of neglect, he now became mean and controlling. When she became involved in after-hours school projects, he felt aggrieved at her absence. “If you want to be part of this family, you need to put in the time,” he would say, and then ignore her for days. He would also grope Laurene in front of her, moaning ostentatiously. When Lisa got up to leave on one such occasion, he stopped her. “‘Hey Lis’,’ he said. ‘Stay here. We’re having a family moment.’”Hers is, of course, a one-sided account, one that has been backed by her mother but staunchly rejected by her stepmother and her aunt, the writer Mona Simpson. In memoirs, as in life, one person’s fact is often another’s fiction. Brennan-Jobs doesn’t emerge smelling of roses either. She is fitfully cruel to her mother, she steals $100 bills from Jobs’s bedroom as a teenager, and compulsively pinches trinkets from his house as he lies dying. In his final days, he asks her if she is going to write about him. “No,” she replies. Her father has rarely been portrayed as a saint but Small Fry reveals him as a man capable of startling selfishness and cruelty to those closest to him. Given all she endured, who could begrudge his daughter the last word?• Small Fry: a Memoir is published by Atlantic. To order a copy for £14.44 (RRP £16.99) go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

That’s why we are putting all our energy into getting the good deal that we want with our EU friends and partners, while making sure we manage the risks if it doesn’t happen.“All I’m gently saying it’s rather easy for a business to blame Brexit and the politicians rather than taking responsibility for their own situation.”John Lewis Partnership – which owns a string of department stores and the Waitrose supermarket chain – said pre-tax profits before one-off items fell to £1.2m in the six months to 28 July, from £83m a year in the same period a year earlier.It said the main reason for the fall in profits was the £40m cost of matching discount among rivals at its chain of John Lewis department stores .Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, said that despite the hit to profits in matching twice as many discount extravaganzas and much deeper discounts across the market – especially in fashion and beauty – the company would be sticking with Never Knowingly Undersold. “In terms of trust it is extremely valuable,” he said. Responding to Raab’s comments, Mayfield told reporters he had not blamed Brexit for John Lewis’s troubles but that the weakness of the pound, which ed in value after the Brexit vote, had already increased costs for the business.“I didn’t actually say that Brexit is to blame for our results. But the fact is that sterling is weaker and one of the factors in that is uncertainty,” he said.Mayfieldsaid : “These are challenging times in retail … Profits before exceptionals are always lower and more volatile in the first half than the second half. It is especially so this half-year, driven mainly by John Lewis \u0026amp Partners where gross margin has been squeezed in what has been the most promotional market we’ve seen in almost a decade.”The company added that the “level of uncertainty facing consumers and the economy, in part due to ongoing Brexit negotiations” made it difficult to forecast trading for the next six months but it expected profits to be down.Like “cliff edge”, except worse. No deal implies slamming the door on the article 50 orce talks, which would make the prospect of a future FTA extremely remote. The chaos that would ensue is difficult to exaggerate.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.Earlier he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that he hoped not to see a no-deal Brexit: “That would be a very bad outcome for the UK and the consequences are extremely unpredictable.” He made clear that it wasn’t possible for Waitrose to stockpile goods to prepare for any interruption in food deliveries from the EU caused by a no-deal Brexit. “It rots, and you waste it,” he said.However, Mayfield indicated that John Lewis was keeping a tight control on costs and hoarding cash, giving it the “highest liquidity position in a long time” so it had the resources available to cope with any “tight squeeze”.He later told reporters: “We are not sitting back feeling sorry for ourselves we are getting on and developing our business.“We are setting out to sow the seeds of success in difficult times. We have done that before and I think we are going to do that again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f5092d90bdebfa517b4409efce642c201c8385a/0_178_3974_2384/master/3974.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d924d790d40f020a8ed75bf7bdfb546d","title":"bank of england ecb turkey interest rate decisions john lewis profits tumble business live","story":"All the day’s economic and financial news, as UK central bank leaves interest rates on hold and Turkey announces a whopping rate hikeTime for a quick recap.The news sent the lira soaring, as traders welcomed this show of strength by the Central Bank of Turkey.Moody’s, the rating agency, has warned that a No-Deal Brexit would hurt the UK, possibly pushing it into recession.

Back in Frankfurt, Mario Draghi has warned that risks from protectionism, and emerging market volatility, have risen.But still, he argues that the risks to the euro area growth outlook are “broadly balanced”.Just in: US inflation rose by less than expected last month.Over in Frankfurt, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is giving his press conference.He confirms that the ECB left interest rates unchanged, and intents to leave them at their present record lows until at least next summer.Draghi also confirms that the ECB expects to stop buying new bonds through its asset purchase scheme after December, but will keep re-investing the proceeds from the scheme “for an extended period of time”, and as long as needed to maintain “favourable liquidity conditions” and “an ample degree of monetary accommodation”.Paul Greer, portfolio manager at Fidelity International, says the Turkish central bank should have acted sooner to raise rates and strengthen the lira.However, he also fears today’s rate hike will drive the economy into recession. “Going forward the focus will now fall on Turkish growth which is slowing very quickly as the economy, and the current account deficit in particular, rebalances. Today’s move, while helping to moderate inflationary pressures, will accelerate the slowdown and probably push Turkey into a recession.The next challenge for Turkey will be how does the economy deal with this slowdown, particularly in the banking sector where capital ratios have been eroded and asset quality will further diminish.Relief that Turkey’s central bank has delivered such a chunky interest rate hike is driving shares up in Istanbul."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6827571fd917a875e73a36fdb3dc102869f3ef7/0_23_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bebc8355a387ee2e46765779d8f4ee8","title":"grid giant filters clean delhi air pollution smog","story":"Thinking big in the fight against smog, architects have designed 100m-high pollution-absorbing towers for India’s capital cityThe Indian capital regularly tops lists of the most polluted cities on earth and its residents even refer to the months when a confluence of events – crop burning, no rain, fireworks – leads to low visibility and breathability as “smog season”.But a new concept by the Dubai-based architecture firm Znera imagines a solution embedded into the Delhi skyline: a network of giant towers that would absorb pollution and recycle it back into breathable air.The Smog Project has been shortlisted for the Experimental Future Project of the Year award 2018 at the World Architecture Festival. It is based on a far-reaching grid of 100-metre-high buildings that function as filters, each potentially producing a 1.2-square-mile area of cleaned air.Filtration mechanisms in the bottom of each structure would catch pollutants at the level where people breathe, and giant fans at the apex would pump out the purified air. Znera says up to 3.2m cubic metres of clean air could be produced each day.But how does something so conceptual help in the fight against smog? “It’s the first step in the right direction, and that first step has to be a bold one,” says Najmus Chowdhry, principal architect at Znera.“We drew up this dystopia to shock people into realising that if something isn’t done we are approaching an irreversible disaster.“The situation in Delhi is grave, and since I am from India, from Punjab, and spend a lot of time there, I feel there isn’t enough being done to even think about how to tackle this critical situation. These schemes about vehicles with odd and even number plates don’t go far enough.”Chowdhry is alluding to plans such as alternating vehicles, banning older cars and crackdowns on two- and three-wheelers, such as auto-rickshaws – schemes that are rarely enforced. Other ideas have included rain cannons and water-spraying helicopters – which could not take off, due to smog. Chowdhry says the mindset needs to change.“It’s easy to think we are just publishing pretty pictures or designs, but we have had the technical details worked out, at least the mechanics of whether it is possible. I know people will say the concept is against gravity or simply about aesthetics, but they are posing the wrong questions.“The real question is: what has been done so far to tackle smog? We’re perfectly happy to be criticised – we should be criticised, because then it means people are thinking what doesn’t work in our designs, and hopefully thinking about what can work.”Another smog-busting project may also offer some hope. Roosegaarde Studios’ Smog Free Towers have been installed in Rotterdam and Krakow – although they are a mere seven metres tall.The Dutch head of the design studio, Daan Roosegarde, says: “The existing towers are working well and have had a good reaction. Every time I start a new project, some say it can’t be done, but sometimes we need to upgrade reality. And that’s what we need to do in Delhi.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2773dee69ac46a0dea3325fb9c9e5cd8edf3e494/0_19_3562_2138/master/3562.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=737738f8680d51d3fb05d5c6a4698c33","title":"ireland brexit good friday agreement","story":"We may be about to see the biggest Anglo-Irish row since the early 1980s. In the next few weeks don’t be surprised if Tory MPs and “sources close to the government” turn up the heat on the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, branding him bloody-minded and reckless over insisting on a legal “backstop” to prevent a post-Brexit hard border in Ireland.For Theresa May the backstop is a slowly closing trap, crushing her hopes of a Brexit deal between hard Brexiter opposition to staying in a customs union and DUP resistance to a special deal for Northern Ireland. Her survival strategy will involve pressuring Varadkar to drop the idea of a comprehensive, “all-weather” border backstop as the price of a Brexit deal, briefing sympathetic journalists, and ramping up the diplomatic pressure. What many UK politicians don’t understand is that Varadkar, like May, is politically boxed in. He has everything to lose by accepting less than Britain’s December commitments to no hard border, which he described as “bulletproof”.Those who think that May will escape the trap by facing down the DUP need to look at her strategy. She has gone out of her way – most recently in Belfast – to condemn the EU’s backstop solution for Northern Ireland as an attack on the constitutional integrity of the UK. She is using this “threat to the union” argument to drag her party towards an “unpalatable, but at worst temporary” form of customs union.In any case, facing down the DUP may soon be illegal. In July, the government bowed to backbench pressure to accept amendments to the trade bill designed to limit customs cooperation with the EU. Amid the parliamentary drama, little attention was given to the fourth of these, an amendment that needs little gloss: “It shall be unlawful for Her Majesty’s government to enter into arrangements under which Northern Ireland forms part of a separate customs territory to Great Britain.”Is Britain ready to sign up to permanent membership of a customs union (by whatever name), as defined by the EU? That’s not what May says, for now at least. Varadkar is unlikely to announce to the Dáil that he has accepted a watered-down guarantee on the border because he trusts that the UK will, despite its government’s stated policy and deep Tory opposition, stay in an EU customs union – for ever.Could there be a compromise? There is increasing diplomatic chatter about a backstop to the backstop, where the whole UK stays in a customs union “unless and until” a final, soft-enough deal is done. Chris Giles of the Financial Times suggests an ingenious “sharing the pain” deal, where only Northern Ireland gets fully frictionless trade with the EU, to encourage the UK to come to a swift decision on a de facto customs union during the transition. Either requires May to compromise.For Irish politicians and voters, the alternative means taking a risk with instability not just in Northern Ireland, but in the Republic too. The Irish state’s increasingly confident sense of liberal, European identity depends in part on an enduring settlement in Northern Ireland. Varadkar is the first Irish leader to talk unselfconsciously about “Ireland” in contrast to “Northern Ireland”. The Good Friday agreement made that possible, allowing the Republic to lay some powerful ghosts to rest and move on, without betraying those in the North who will always see themselves as Irish. It was a political settlement for all-Ireland, approved by referendums north and south of the border. No one in the Republic wants to drag the country that Ireland has become back into a bitter, unwinnable debate about identity and borders, consuming political energy and iding opinion for years ahead. That looks too much like Brexit.• Paul McGrade provides senior counsel at Lexington Communications.

Immigration, of course. Theresa May is reported to be planning to announce “strict immigration controls” in her party conference speech, the last refuge of the disreputable politician. Her record on immigration is one of such spectacular failure from every point of view that she might be wiser to ert attention elsewhere. But no: the Times reports that she is summoning a special immigration cabinet meeting on the eve of conference designed to rally the rebels.For a good contrast between the parties, Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, today spells out a pragmatic, practical and politically canny immigration policy for Labour. Here’s another symbolic moment of contrast between the erratic behaviour of the bedlam party in power and the gradual laying down of solid policies by Labour, even if no one is paying much attention.Migration remains politically explosive: mishandled, it always has the potential to sink Labour. Look how wickedly – and successfully – the leavers stirred race-hate and panic in the referendum, with the likes of Michael Gove mendaciously suggesting 80 million Turks were heading to the UK, while the Daily Mail’s front page daily splashed with dark-skinned men climbing off lorries, or rows of migrant criminal mugshots, devoid of context or statistic.Labour will abandon the net migration target of below 100,000 a year, always an absurdity David Cameron plucked from the air. No government could hit a target that relies on whims about how many people emigrate. No random limit makes sense, ignoring as it does the state of the economy and the fluctuating needs of industries and public services.Labour will abolish rigid targets for the insanely complex 15 different levels, tiers and types of visa, but use a flexible responsiveness to the need for workers, combined with better training of our own workforce to fill vacancies. Abbott was backed up by the Home Office’s former permanent secretary, Sir David Normington, who told the Today programme on Thursday that a fixed number was always unachievable, warning that “targets get discredited if they are never met.”None of May’s migration system works, not the overstretched Border Force, the removals, detention or endless backlog of cases. Theresa May’s long Home Office tenure was a period of serious maladministration that should have disqualified her from the top job. Instead, Amber Rudd, her hapless successor, took the drop.May’s refusal to take temporary students out of overall numbers was a sign of mulish obduracy that characterises all her policy-making. Only after years of NHS shortages has she finally abandoned limits on desperately needed doctors and nurses – but still not on care workers. The migration advisory committee recommended many more seasonal farm worker visas: finally she has relented to offer just 2,500 when farmers says they need 75,000 to stop produce rotting in the fields. In comparison, Abbott’s work visas, issued according to national need, are plain common sense. She says nothing yet on the crucial question of whether EU citizens will get preferential treatment: Labour waits to see the deal first.Note, too, that two thirds would support ID cards, which both Normington and Rudd floated again this week. Given the way people now routinely give out vast information to all and sundry in almost every online transaction, the privacy case is almost nugatory. If it would reassure those who worry that health, benefits and other services are used by immigrants with no entitlement, then Labour might do well to return to this previous plan. Last time it was, disastrously, proposed to cost each citizen £75. This time, why not simply issue free passports to every citizen (now costing £75), and make an ID card the valuable asset every new arrival acquires with their visa?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63f82870fef8c7b1e82fa5d52fdcc0573de0ac66/0_472_6738_4043/master/6738.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea01ae1c38527cd2e2b5e32755bf18f9","title":"decoding the power of the bathroom selfie","story":"How the loo became fashion’s favourite backdropA long row of sinks and at each one a woman, leaning. “They rummage through their handbags, pulling out various make-up items applying blushers, concealers and brightly coloured lip-glosses.” In the academic book Women And Alcohol: Social Perspectives, under the titillating heading Glamour Over Consumption, this ethnographic data from a city-centre pub in Canterbury explores the way a bathroom allows women to “assess their intoxication and femininity”, taking part in a familiar form of “calculated hedonism”. Backcombing her hair, one turns to the stranger at the next mirror and asks, “I don’t look too drunk, do I?” The stranger reassures her, of course, because that’s what women do, in the toilets, at night. We urinate, we check our lipstick, and we comfort each other that we look exactly the right amount of pissed. And sometimes, perhaps knowing that otherwise we might forget this moment of uncommon warmth, we take a photo, too.Even when we ignore the politics of bathrooms, tiny rooms that contain our most primal anxieties and where debates about gender identity continue to play out in the media, toilets (one of the last officially gender segregated spaces in the world) are unique as sites of extreme and glittering intimacy. No wonder then, that they have also become stage sets for Instagram. A shift happened after Anna Wintour’s selfie ban at last year’s Met Gala, when the impossibility of abiding by such a frankly mad law sent celebrities trotting with their phones to the bathroom. The resulting photos – from Kylie Jenner’s Last Supper-like selfie, featuring a menu of stars including Frank Ocean and Brie Larson pouting in the mirror, to those of models smoking louchely on the tiled floor, one shot captioned ‘Real VIP Room’– inspired an art exhibition in Brooklyn, where visitors received candy cigarettes on entry. Elsewhere, toilet selfies are going viral for different reasons. When Twitter user Paula Sophia Garcia Epsino posted a photo sitting on her aunt’s bathroom counter in Mexico, the internet paused to marvel, briefly, not at her tiny shorts, but at the boggling placing of a toilet roll holder across the room from the toilet. Each person imagined their inevitable waddle.It was a Tuesday night, and Leanne Elliott Young, a creative director based between London and New York, was stuck in the loo at Isabel, a new Mayfair restaurant where each toilet features a unique hand-painted wallpaper of tropical flamingoes or Korean peonies. She used the time to read the graffiti on her Ingrid Kraftchenko boots (“They’re not just shoes,” Young insists, “they are deep with sorrow, dramatic aggression, contemplations and conversations with the self”) and enjoy the drama of her Charles Jeffrey flag dress, after “decoding the visual syntax and semantics of this flag by @_charlesjeffrey”. The fancy bathroom, with its marble ledge and big mirror, was ideal. “Where else can you get your foot that close to your face?”The distant toilet roll holder is not a mistake many interior designers will make in future, having learned (through the millions of likes under hashtags such as Young’s) the importance of an Instagrammable bathroom, including the obligatory marble ledge. To scroll through bathroom selfies is to rinse yourself in orchids and the colour pink, with women selfie-ing themselves in poses they’d be shy to make in public. Or, after two or three drinks, with their friends. Or, after three or four, with strangers. Makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury, creator of “glow”, was hired to ensure the bathroom at London club Annabel’s, with its flowered ceiling and vaginal colour palette, was the optimal space for applying, then documenting, your makeup. She added lighting dials, for guests to perfect their reflection, and it worked – after washing their hands, women gather nightly, hand on hip, in a space built for photographs as much as hygiene. While bathrooms have always been the places where we bond and lounge and rebuild ourselves with new layers of bronzer, now they are being designed with the performance of femininity in mind. There are the girly pink powder rooms, the monochrome cells with tiles that tessellate oddly when drunk, like Ibérica in Leeds, the womby boudoirs, the maximalist jungles with erotic wallpapers and more pillows than a hospital, and the mind-bending halls of mirrors, such as the bathroom at Yotam Ottolenghi’s Nopi in London or Crazy Bear in Beaconsfield, where a single selfie goes on for miles.Young is a queen of the bathroom selfie (for her money, the top three are all in London: the Ritz, Sketch and Hoi Polloi), in part because of her sense of toilet humour. But she says the rise of the selfie has changed the bathroom experience. “Now it’s a place of cold blank pouty stares into the void of social media likes. Taking photos, most people forget to wash their hands. And you get to see the ugly side of a selfie. That blue steel pre-filter, pre-Facetune duck face. The idea of pouting semi-naked, somewhere you’ve just evacuated your bowels, still makes me laugh out loud.” Though she delights in sharing her own bathroom selfies, along with, at last Instagram count, 1.4 million others, it’s getting more difficult. “The queues were once miles long due to folk snorting coke now it’s because they’re tussling around to get the best shot. I’m in and out quite quick, toilet seat up, toilet rolls in full view, snap!”Which is not to say she hasn’t considered the place of the bathroom selfie in popular culture, compiling her own casual ethnographic data. “It’s a moment that blurs the private and public. It’s a public place that you’re private within.” There’s a lock on the door, “so it’s a private space to curate. To be scantily clad but snapping away. To be free!”Around Eva’s sink are her makeup recommendations for an Instagrammable night out (from left): Wonderglow, £38.50, Charlotte Tilbury. Eleventh Hour hair perfume, £48, Byredo.

Steven Eastwood, whose new documentary follows hospice patients confronting their final days, explains why this squeamishness does us a disserviceIf you watch movies you’ll have seen umpteen deaths, sometimes in a single film. (According to the people who keep a tally of such things, the final Lord of the Rings has cinema’s highest body count, of more than 800 – though presumably that includes orcs.) But what about the dying process itself? What happens to a body that is dying? A taboo-breaking new documentary filmed inside a hospice on the Isle of Wight controversially features a seven-minute scene of the final moments of Alan Hardy, a retired north London bus depot manager.Island is directed by the artist and film-maker Steven Eastwood. It started life as an installation commissioned by the Fabrica Gallery in Brighton. Eastwood spent 12 months at the Earl Mountbatten Hospice in Newport between 2015 and 2016, working with terminally ill patients, four of whom appear in the film. What’s so dramatic about the footage of Alan’s death is how undramatic is. I don’t know what I was expecting, a deathbed scene like the movies, perhaps: Alan mustering a few profound last words to make sense of it all, or a glimmer in his eyes as life flashes before him.Instead, for seven minutes, Alan’s drawn-out breaths become further spread apart until they stop. Medicated to blankness, he goes gentle into the night – thanks to the unfailing dedication of the hospice team who’ve carefully managed his death over two days.I tell Eastwood I was expecting something more. He nods. Other people have said the same thing. “What’s interesting is there isn’t an image. You can’t see the dying. I think that’s fascinating, because to talk about how the film shows you the moment of death, I don’t know when that moment is. I’ve watched it over and over. I still find myself thinking: is he going to breathe again?” As it happens, when the end came for Alan, Eastwood was asleep – you can hear him snoring gently off camera. “I’d been filming continuously for 38 hours, so the nurses put a little mattress on the floor. I laid down 20 minutes before he died.”How did he feel when he woke up and realised Alan was gone? “Elated, I really did. I could clearly see that his death had been very cared for, supported and painless. His death had been as a good a death as you could ask for.” The camera stays switched on as the nurses wash Alan’s body and comb his hair their tenderness and respect are deeply moving.Eastwood had just started volunteering at his local hospice in east London when he saw the gallery’s call-out for submissions on the subject of end of life. What interested him about filming in a hospice? “I realised that there weren’t a lot of films about end of life. I just thought: how strange that there are very poor descriptions of something as natural as death, that’s happening on every street. In the history of visual art, there’s so many depictions of deathbeds. Isn’t it interesting that it’s fallen out of the space of art?” He mentions two contemporary artists who’ve tackled death through their work, Sophie Calle and Bill Viola, who both filmed their mothers as they lay dying.But why are there so few films that look death squarely in the face? A quick search on Google for “films about death” throws up a random list that includes Bambi (fine if you’re seven) Flatliners, the hokey 80s thriller about medical students messing about with defibrillators and The Death of Stalin, Armando Iannucci’s Soviet-era satire (which, yes, opens with Joseph Stalin carking it, but no, doesn’t have much to say about mortality, unless you’re the feared dictator of a totalitarian state). You’ll find the web’s longest list of films about death on the website Urns Online, which promises everything from “light comedy to stark and depressing art films”.The fact is that serious dramas involving death tend to focus more on dispelling stigma around illnesses – Aids in Philadelphia, Alzheimer’s in Away from Her – than the dying process. You can picture a director pitching a mortality-themed script to financiers: “I’m thinking hospital ward. I’m think nursing home. Let’s show them what really happens when you die. Whaddya think?” Stony silence. So perhaps there will always be a gap between fiction and reality.But documentaries do push the limits of what can be shown on screen. In 2003, Allan King filmed five terminally ill patients in a hospice in Toronto for his vérité documentary Dying at Grace. During the Aids crisis, a number of films intimately chronicled men dying from the disease (Silverlake Life: The View from Here, Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt). Controversially, the 2006 film The Bridge showed the actual suicides of people leaping to their deaths from the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco. Director Eric Steel set up a camera to film the bridge 247 for a year, then interviewed friends and families of the jumpers. The Bridge ided critics – ghoulish snuff film or poetic meditation on suicide?Why do we have this taboo of showing death on screen, I ask Eastwood. “This what interests me as a maker. We carry with us a lot of folk wisdom or rules about what we think is appropriate. And I think we sometimes don’t check in with ourselves about whether that has any bearing any more.”In the weeks before shooting Island, he experienced two bereavements himself: “My partner at the time’s mother – the grandmother of my children – and my closest friend died within weeks of each other. I was already in that mental space. So, I was able to say to people I was talking to about the film that I’d just had a bereavement. I wouldn’t have asked for it to be that way …” His voice trails off.Virtually all the terminally ill patients Eastwood approached on the Isle of Wight were interested in meeting him to talk about the film. “They were quite happy with a camera coming into their life at that time. I think the assumption is that it wouldn’t be wanted.” Alan used to joke that he was his Charlton Heston. “I think he really enjoyed leading-man status, and the attention.” Alan, it turns out, had strong beliefs about life after death. Earlier in the film, he tells the camera that he’s convinced the core of him will live on. He wants to see his wife again in the next life. “I’ve got plans. I’m going to take up ballroom dancing.” Does he think immortality – the chance to live on in some way on film – motivates his subjects, I ask Eastwood. “I don’t know. I didn’t really discuss legacy with them.”It was the nurses that he struggled to get in front of the camera. Five months into shooting, he called an emergency meeting at the hospice. “I showed them a rough cut of the film, and I said: ‘It looks as though nobody is receiving care in this building.’” Why does he think they were so reticent? “I think they’re trained to be selfless.” One of the things that struck him watching the nurses was how much time they spent on the non-medical stuff. “What happens if this person’s estranged father turns up? Their gay partner? All these people are brought together in one room, and the nurses have to manage all of those emotions while delivering medication. Hospices are a space of life. All the drama, all of the emotions, all of the joy. Everybody had a dread of them, but I think they’re some of the most progressive spaces in our society.”Eastwood believes that hospices should be more visible in the community to remove the stigma around terminal illness and dying – to make death more familiar, less frightening.He compares our squeamishness around death to how society used to view childbirth: “Fifty years ago there weren’t many photographs or films of births, but now that’s understood as a celebration of our bodies.” People have come up to him after screenings, telling him the film has made them less scared about dying. “There’s lots of research that shows that being better informed about what happens to our bodies when we are dying can alleviate anxiety.”If Alan’s death feels natural, the tragedy of the film belongs to Jamie Gunnell, a 40-year-old lorry driver and father of two. He was diagnosed with stage-four cancer after going to his doctor with a stomach ache. “It came out of nowhere for him,” says Eastwood. “Jamie went through a lot.” In the film you watch Jamie and a couple of his mates sitting in his room at the hospice watching football with a few cans of Guinness on the go. It’s oddly very moving to see these blokiest of blokes joking about cancer. “Fucking hell,” says one of them watching a nurse drain the contents of Jamie’s stomach into a bag. “Looks like chicken stock.”Eastwood says that Jamie and his mates were determined to “continue their relationship on normal terms”. And business as usual meant booze and banter. “Guinness cans and football, smoking a joint out the back, that’s how he wanted to die.” Still, the film’s most haunting images are of Jamie, his face stricken by fear and confusion – totally alone, as if he is already seeing the world from the outside. “He went through period of anger and desperation, but then would bounce back, and his humour was always there. That was his way of normalising it.”Eastwood says that nurses talk about something happening when a patient is very close to death – the temperature changing in the room. Has making the film changed how he feels about death and his own mortality? He shrugs. “I take a pretty stoical view on it. I don’t feel any great fear about it. I’m very aware that I’m an animal, a biological thing. Possibly, it has made me feel reassured.”• Island is released in the UK on 14 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e08adbf448d8a0dcbae35d542e0cc81d8d03be9e/0_463_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f2f1a5c65f86eb88bbd72c192cca02b","title":"european food cliche pasta croissants holiday eating jay rayner","story":"What’s so wrong with buttery croissants, stinky cheese, and just-picked tomatoes?I am, by nature, suspicious of food cliches. I don’t think Grandma’s cooking was always better. Certainly, my grandmother’s wasn’t. She hadn’t met a packet she couldn’t open and regarded the notion that she should cook from scratch as a calculated insult. Likewise, the good old days were nowhere near as good as now: choice was limited, quality was poor and “abundance” was a word for spelling competitions, not a descriptive term to be applied to food stocks.I have long bridled at the insistence that the food cultures of our European neighbours are so much better than ours. It ignores the realities of history. Yes, trying to find a good meal in Britain outside the home (and inside it, for that matter) immediately after the second world war was as tricky as finding an honest banker in London’s Square Mile. Then again, during that war we industrialised food production to help fight a war of national survival, losing purchase on both cookery traditions and kitchen skills.And what’s so good about those robust food cultures anyway? They tend to be inward-looking and small-minded. Two weeks in Tuscany sounds like a fabulous idea. Then the reality slides in, like ink seeping slowly across blotting paper: day after day of the same bloody pasta dishes, the same rustic salads and anything for dessert as long as it’s tira-sodding-misu or something “inventive” involving pears and almonds. By day five, what you wouldn’t do for a bit of Thai food doesn’t bear thinking about. We eat more widely and thrillingly in Britain specifically because of the weakness of our indigenous food culture. And yet, here I sit on a sun-dappled terrace in south-west France, for, as I write, it is August and I am nothing if not a fully paid-up member of the Mainstream Media Liberal Elite. I have just returned from a run to the local boulangerie for armfuls of croissant baked this morning.In the kitchen, we have baskets of plump, misshapen tomatoes from the fields just below the house we are staying in, a board full of stinky French cheeses making a bid for freedom and slabs of paté that smell of all the best bits of ground animal. We have wandered the local market, buying up boxes of golden girolles from the local hillsides at prices that would make the mortgage payers of Islington weep, and loaves of a sweet, sticky pastry halfway between bread and cake, soaked in syrup and just enough fragrant flower water. We are debating whether it is rose or orange blossom, because here, on our sun-dappled terrace, we have nothing more important to detain us.Oh god. I have become the living, breathing embodiment of every damn filthy food cliche of which I claim to be suspicious I am the heir to snooty Elizabeth David made soft, wobbling, French-cheese-boosted flesh. But the thing is, I am loving every moment of it. We are often told that rage and anger are specialisms of the young. I try to subvert this by getting angry and staying that way. But it seems I am unequal to the task that all it takes to soothe me is a good selection of cheeses and a recently picked fig on the turn. It turns out that food cliches are cliches for a reason: because they are just so damn lovely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3fff8b827403a7af54f282e694edeabfcdac18e/76_499_3849_2309/master/3849.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc82f86c46f8905b7aa72460008ae12b","title":"i should cocoa the best home hot chocolate makers","story":"Can homemade ever rival cafe-bought versions of the hot, milky drink? We tried five DIY machines to find outAnyone who has sat on a British beach blue with cold will know that nothing beats a flask of hot chocolate, regardless of how it is made – so long as it is creamy and sweet.So, when you are neither on holiday nor willing to spend a small fortune at a fancy cafe, which are the best machines out there for making hot chocolate like a pro at home? I tested five to find out.Having never used a home-brew machine of this kind, I opened it to find it came with no ingredients. After buying some Tassimo pods, I stared at the manual. It may be because Bosch’s target audience is multinational, but the instructions were all symbols – no text – and, damn, I could have done with some written instruction.I fiddled about with the Vivy like an octogenarian with an iPhone until my friend looked up a YouTube tutorial. Several mind-numbingly monotone minutes later, I knew what a T-disc was and where to put it, only to realise I hadn’t bought the milk ones I needed to go with the chocolate ones I had. Out I went again to purchase another eight-pod pack of T-discs.In fact, I didn’t get straight chocolate: I got Oreo. If you are going to use a machine that makes a hot drink with opaque plastic pods and a tankful of water, why not go full tilt? Also, this summer’s heatwave led to my five-year-old discovering Oreo ice-creams and, if I’m honest, they are not half bad. Unfortunately, the same could not be said for the hot chocolate version. It was disgusting. Tassimo’s other chocolatey guest brands sound more promising – Cadbury, Milka and Suchard offer compatible pods – but it was too painful to figure out, too potentially disappointing to taste and, mostly, too much landfill to bin to try again.Ease of use: 25 (The instructions are much too complicated to figure out, but once you have the hang of the machine, it is easy too much unavoidable wastage)Quality of drink: 35 (Decent froth hot no real milk or chocolate cost of ingredients dictated by machine)It is not that price necessarily dictates quality, but in this instance I think it might. This is a cafetiere-style glass jug with a handle, lid and base made from plastic. You gently heat milk in a saucepan, then pour it into the jug, add hot-chocolate mix and plunge the lid down repeatedly until, as the blurb specifies, the hot chocolate is thoroughly mixed in and a frothy consistency is achieved – or, as my mugful attests to, a thin, lukewarm drink topped with a middling layer of bubbly froth is obtained. It costs only £17, but why spend even that much for something this underwhelming? Whisking by hand, directly in the saucepan, would have made the same hot chocolate, only hotter.Ease of use: 25 (Milk must be heated separately, so more washing up feels flimsy)Quality of drink: 25 (Too thin too cooled bad frothing)Hotel Chocolat may have dreamed this up, but Dualit designed it, which means it comes with its signature magnetic whisk and a snug-fitting lid it also sits, cordless, on a kettle-style power base. You pour in the raw goods (milk of your choice, plus 35g chocolate flakes), put on the lid and press the button. Minutes later (2min 39sec for whole milk 2min 18sec for almond), the subtle purring stops. You remove the lid and, holding the pleasingly old-school milk-pan-esque side handle, pour out liquid velvet: chocolate melded exquisitely into cloud-like lactic froth.The Velvetiser launches next month and the marketing spiel is eye-roll-inducing – the machine is billed as an “in-home drinking chocolate system” and its name becomes a verb, promising “velvetised drinks” and “perfect velvetising” – but that drink, though. It made me smile, it made me dance, it made me velvetise. Yes, it is an expensive, space-gobbling, single-cup, single-use gadget, but it is a very pretty one – available in eminently millennial colours (copper, matt charcoal, white). And while Hotel Chocolat is keen for you to use its single-serve pouches, I tried other hand-grated chocs, cacaoand even honey. Pourable silken pile, one and all.Ease of use: 45 (No extra washing up, easy to clean, easy and near-silent to operate – but branded chocolate flakes are expensive)Quality of drink: 55 (Hot perfect frothing real milk and chocolate)A cordless electric jug that sits on a power base and makes hot and cold drinks. You pour milk in up to the one-cup or two-cup mark and add powdered, grated (a whopping 84g is recommended for two servings), or, as the manual suggests, Gourmet Gadgetry fondue and fountain chocolate (I opt for grated Green and Black’s). The metallic red design is meant to recall a retro diner, but it looks more like a cheap car.But that is nothing compared with the leakage that ensues when I do exactly as instructed to make a two-cup batch. “DO NOT overfill the machine,” yells the manual. “I DIDN’T,” I yell back, mopping up hot brown milk from table, chair and floor.My daughter and I share what is left in the jug and it is not too shabby: high-speed mechanical stirring definitely achieves better froth than manual plunge-pumping. “Two points,” is my sidekick’s verdict. “But,” she continued, “the pink one (see below) is 100 points.”Ease of use: 35 (Instructions are misleading easy to clean noisy to operate)Quality of drink: 45 (Great frothing hot real milk and chocolate)This was my favourite: an old-fashioned aluminium stove-top jug with a plunger lid to pump and froth and a protective silicone mat. The instructions are nicely loose and straight: you fill the pot up to just below the bottom of the handle, preferably with whole milk (semi or skimmed won’t froth so well) and gently heat on the burner (gas or electric) until the milk is bubbling around the edges, then add in your chocolate – the manual suggests a cocoa mix (I use Cadbury’s powdered hot chocolate) or a grated handful of real chocolate – quantities unspecified – and stir.You then put the pot on the silicon mat, replace the lid and pump up and down. “We have found,” the manual states, “frothing whilst you count to 20 creates optimum results.” I did – and they were. I tried 70g of Prestat’s new ruby chocolate flakes in 600ml of whole milk and obtained two superlative steaming mugfuls of thickly creamy, pale-pink velvet, with no leakage to speak of.Ease of use: 45 (Easy to use great instructions slightly tricky to clean)Quality of drink: 55 (Perfect frothing hot real milk and chocolate) This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Everyone knows the men’s team have been synonymous with success in Europe over the years and that’s certainly what the women are trying to build as well after we began our Champions League campaign with a 2-2 draw against the Danish champions, Brondby.This is the first time Juventus have been in this competition and we are not seeded, so that meant we could have been drawn against anyone including the reigning champions, Lyon, or Wolfsburg, . At this stage you want to feel confident you can at least compete so Brondby was a good draw in that sense.Because the Women’s Champions League doesn’t have group stages, there is a lot of pressure on the draw to be favourable. I’ve been there before with Chelsea in\u0026nbspour first season, when we drew Glasgow in the first round and then Wolfsburg. The nature of the competition means it can be very difficult to build experience in Europe, with some potential David v Goliath match-ups.Uefa should look at introducing a group stage for next season because it feels like a huge missed opportunity at the moment. There are plenty of clubs in the European leagues with big enough squads and resources to play more matches in the Champions League – women’s football is trying to grow up not just domestically but internationally, and the more games that are played at a higher level the better it will be for the whole of the game. Uefa needs to think seriously about extend the competition to have the same setup as the men.Wednesday night was our first game of the season so that’s a lot of pressure to have on when you know that one bad result and it could be all over. We’ve been working hard for six weeks and the defeats against Arsenal and Chelsea in pre-season friendlies were a humbling experience for everyone. Never say never but you have to be realistic about our chances this season – a good target is the last eight and to try to build confidence from there. After the first leg, this target is still in sight and there is everything to play for to go and win in Denmark on 26 September. Champions League football is one of the primary reasons I joined Juventus so I am determined to help the team succeed in the competition.There are a lot differences in pre-season training in Italy, with a big focus on sports science and running mechanics. We have an entire session dedicated to running and change of direction for injury prevention, which has really impressed me. emale athletes are more susceptible to knee injuries so any specific work to develop movement and change of direction mechanics to protect the knees is brilliant.There is also a lot of emphasis on technical drills at Juventus to the extent that the whole warm-up will sometimes be just a series of them. Rita Guarino is by far the best technical coach I have had in my career – often she demonstrates a specific technique and shows the players up! Specific technical training is not something I have done since I was a kid and this is potentially a reason why we have not been able to find the next Gazza or someone like Eden Hazard or Lionel Messi in England for both women and men.From a young age in England I felt technical skills were coached out of me. I remember when I was 15 doing a rainbow flick over a player’s head in training and the coach telling me off and shouting: “This is not the Eni show.” That discouraged me from expressing myself inidually with the ball in that team again. Yes, there has been a move towards more possession-style football in England but not necessarily the ability for inidual players to have massive amounts of skill and get themselves out of tricky situations. Someone like Hazard can have three players around him and it doesn’t matter because his balance and his skill get him out of that pressured situation. I don’t know many English players who can do that. Players such as Ross Barkley or Adam Lallana have that ability but don’t play regularly enough for their clubs. o come to Italy and have 30-minute drills based only on technical ability has been amazing. Hopefully that will really help me add an extra element to my game.One nice about this team is that they spend a lot of time together off the pitch. That makes it easier to get to know people outside of a football environment and I already feel like I’ve known some of the girls for longer than two months because we have connected well. The team keep asking me to show them some new dance moves, I’ve taught some of the Italian girls how to throw a few shapes. Some are a bit stiff so there is a bit of a way to go.Life in Italy is incredible – I had two days off last month and went to Portofino near Genoa. It felt like I was in the Garden of Eden! Such a beautiful place. I was joking with one of my teammates saying: “Why do Italians ever leave Italy?” It has everything – the mountains and the sea are an hour away and then you have all the great cities like Turin, Rome and Milan.The Reggia di Venaria palace is only 20 minutes from my place and it is absolutely stunning. I love going to visit places and then being able to read up on the history afterwards. ff the pitch I’ve always believe it is healthy to switch off from football and have completely different interests too. I love to do other things and have a healthy work-life balance so to be in a place that is so rich in history, culture and food is really exciting for me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f82a9d71947d96bf26b31bdcea98004a965eb65a/0_176_6897_4138/master/6897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=009fc61334aab38ae093d30215b43770","title":"daily mail backs theresa may brexit plan conservative mps traitors","story":"Editorial laments plotting by Brexiter Conservatives against PM as apparent ‘death wish’The Daily Mail has backed Theresa May’s plans for a soft Brexit and described Conservative MPs plotting to oust the prime minister during the negotiations with the EU as “traitors”.Geordie Greig, a former remain supporter who took over as editor from the arch-Brexiter Paul Dacre last week, appears to be shifting the newspaper’s editorial tone towards support for Downing Street’s Chequers plan.An editorial in the Mail on Thursday strongly criticised discussions by Brexit-supporting Tory MPs about May’s future as the “latest manifestation of the party’s apparent death wish”.On a separate page, Andrew Pierce’s reported account of the meeting was headlined “One by one, traitors put the knife into Theresa”.The editorial said: “The Mail has never made a secret of its reservations over aspects of the Chequers compromise. But as the talks with Brussels enter their final stages, the truth is this is the only blueprint for Brexit on the table.“The perception grows that Conservatives are too busy fighting each other to attend to the issues that affect millions – such as the surge in violent crime, recurrent train delays, long waits for GP appointments or the near impossibility of home ownership for most young families.As editor, Dacre was supportive of May but focused relentlessly on Brexit, and he has publicly warned against softening the paper’s line on leaving the EU.The extent to which the Mail’s editorials directly influence the views of the 1.3 million people who buy it every day is a matter of debate, but the newspaper’s print edition remains influential within government and among broadcasters, setting the tone of the political debate.The initial editions of the Mail under Greig appear to suggest a more nuanced editorial line, where a soft Brexit is a price worth paying to keep Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, out of No 10. The shift is in line with what Daily Mail insiders told the  last week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91320933782059f01f09229ec0fd860c64b57520/178_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c86ac778d949bc7736caa7524326919","title":"fans removed dua lipa shanghai concert china","story":"Crowd members also claim people were removed from the venue for dancing in their seatsFootage posted on social media shows audience members being forcefully removed from Dua Lipa’s performance in Shanghai on 12 September. Users claim that fans were targeted for dancing in their seats and waving flags in support of gay rights.The videos show security staff pulling people from their seats, and crowd members apparently being attacked by security guards outside the National Exhibition and Convention Center in the city’s Qingpu district.The English-Albanian singer appeared upset on stage. “I want to create a really safe environment for us all to have fun,” she said towards the end of the concert. “I want us all to dance. I want us all to sing. I want us all to just have a really good time.”Lipa posted a statement to social media the day after the concert: “I will stand by you all for your love and beliefs and I am proud and grateful that you felt safe enough to show your pride at my show. What you did takes a lot of bravery. I always want my music to bring strength, hope and unity. I was horrified by what happened and I send love to all my fans involved.” She pledged to return to Shanghai “when the time is right and hopefully see a room full of rainbows.”The BBC reports that heavy-handed crowd control isn’t uncommon in China. The country decriminalised homosexuality in 1997, but LGBTQ-related content has recently been censored from social media platform Weibo.The Shanghai date was part of Lipa’s first tour of China.

There, Rihanna staged her Savage x Fenty fashion show for the lingerie label she launched in May.The set here was like the garden of Eden sent into the future, with plants sprouting out of geodesic domes. It was populated by about 30 “Eves”, in many different guises. With a sort of “improvisation welcome” mood, they threw shapes across the stage in Savage x Fenty designs.Plus-size models and girls with pink hair shared the stage with the Hadid sisters and former Victoria Secrets angel Joan Smalls. Rihanna herself joined them for a finale, drawing much whooping from the crowd.At show like this, clothes aren’t really the point but, for the record, these had a louche, decadent vibe with lots of coloured satin and leopard print. Interpretations of underwear ranged from sports bras to full-on basques.When Rihanna launched Savage x Fenty, it swiftly sold out both online and in stores. This show aimed to keep up the heat, with a livestream broadcast on YouTube and some pieces available to buy after the show.Savage x Fenty follows Fenty Beauty, a makeup line which launched in 2017 and saw queues of women outside Harvey Nichols in London. Both brands champion ersity and body positivity, with Savage x Fenty available in seven “nude” shades and up to a 44DD cup size. Like the show, the initial advertising campaign for the brand featured a range of skin colours and sizes.Female empowerment is the zeitgeist-friendly message of the musician’s underwear range. “Women should be wearing lingerie for their damn selves,” she said to US Vogue in May. “I want people to wear Savage x Fenty and think: I’m a bad bitch. I want women to own their beauty.” The young women on the stage on Wednesday night were a great advertisement for doing just that.Rihanna, who earned $36m in 2016, is one of the most influential style figures in pop culture currently, much admired for her risk-taking and spontaneity. Such is her influence that when she appeared on the front of British Vogue for August, she single-handedly made pencil-thin eyebrows – a faux pas for many years – a trend again. Her 2016 collaboration with Puma on a Fenty clothing collection generated $1bn for the sportswear brand. Savage x Fenty is the latest way she is monetising that influence.Marc Jacobs’ show was earlier in the evening. It was scheduled for 6pm but was delayed by nearly 90 minutes, causing Anna Wintour and several other high-profile editors to leave before it started. There are already consistent rumours that the Marc Jacobs brand is in jeopardy, with stores in Europe closing earlier this year. This latest talking point isn’t likely to stop the rumours.The collection was a summer take on the designer’s autumnwinter 80s odyssey. There were boxy suits, glitter tights and puffball cocktail dresses. Frills were extreme, with some dresses like the mille-feuille of the most luxurious of cakes, in sugared almond colours. These fabulous concoctions will no doubt be eaten up by stylists next season, though their wearability beyond the fashion shoot is untested.Jacobs is now a celebrity as well as a designer. In April, he proposed to his partner Charly Defrancesco with a flash mob in a branch of Mexican fast food restaurant Chipotle. The video went viral. His summer since then has involved a birthday party with Debbie Harry bringing in his cake, and holidays with Kate Moss. This show is just the latest instalment for his many fans to absorb."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/549736ce5486b12df74210ae59af8d2a45af1efc/0_182_3316_1990/master/3316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1fc155b2d385262db60a47c9d2f5b8f","title":"she was on a roll the cranberries on the last days of dolores oriordan","story":"The Irish band are piecing together their final album following the recent death of their lead singer. They talk candidly about her troubled life and the challenges of working without herThe last time the Cranberries guitarist Noel Hogan saw Dolores O’Riordan was in the Limerick hotel where we are now standing, in November 2017. He had agreed to do an interview with a Chinese journalist: the band are huge in China, apparently, and had a run of arena gigs booked there. O’Riordan was living in New York and she wanted distraction she decided, in a typically whimsical move, to come to meet the journalist, too, taking the direct flight to Shannon airport. She was in good spirits, although ongoing back problems – a slipped disc, from picking up a guitar – had led to a cancelled tour that summer.Christmas came and went, but the Cranberries were still recording. O’Riordan would send Hogan vocals by email. On 14 January, she emailed him new songs: she had flown to London to record a new vocal for a cover of their 1993 hit Zombie with the metal band Bad Wolves. At 1.12am on 15 January, calling from the Park Lane Hilton, she left a friend an excited voicemail in which she said the cover version was sounding “fucking terribly good”. At 2am, she spoke to her mother. Later that night, she died. I meet the band four days before an inquest ruled that the 46-year-old had drowned accidentally in the bath, with high levels of alcohol in her blood. Hogan looks around the lobby and says it is hard to believe that the last time he saw her it was somewhere so mundane.On the top floor, with its views out over the Shannon river, three Cranberries bear the mark of men still coming to terms with bereavement. Like many bands who lose a member, they threw themselves into activity. Their new album was nearly finished, so they completed it April and May passed by in a blur. The strangest thing, they tell me, was that working in the studio was not all that different. The three of them would always record by day and Dolores would come in to sing at night, alone, with producer Stephen Street.“We’d pass each other in the corridor,” says bassist Mike Hogan, Noel’s brother, who was only 20 when the band achieved international fame. “Dolores would say: ‘You know that thing you recorded?’ I’d say: ‘You mean the thing that took me five hours to get right?’ She’d say: ‘Yeah, it’s not working!’ This time around, there were nights when we were waiting, looking for her to come in the door.”“Waiting for her to come in, like,” echoes his brother. “I found that, at night, I was so exhausted. Not physically, but mentally those months from when Dolores passed away were intense.”The pair, along with drummer Fergal Lawler, are a close-knit circle, managed by one of O’Riordan’s five brothers. She grew up 10 miles out of Limerick in Ballybricken, but they are from the town and met when breakdancing in their teens in the mid-80s. They first saw Dolores when she was 19 and tried out for their band she was painfully shy and quiet, they all agree, but “when she sang”, says Noel, “I wondered how and why she wasn’t already in a band. I didn’t want to question it. We were lucky enough that she had come into this room.”While the four of them shared a love for the Smiths and the Cure, O’Riordan’s vocal style stood alone: it was described by a Melody Maker journalist in 1991 as “the voice of a saint trapped in a glass harp”. She learned her yodel from her dad, a country music fan, and there were church influences, too. The music mag went to her family home to meet the band and painted an intriguing, kitsch picture: a Jesus clock and holy water from Lourdes, with Christmas turkeys being bred in a shed in the dark. She adored her father, a farm labourer who was injured in a motorbike accident that left him unable to work she is buried alongside him in St Ailbe’s Church, Ballybricken.O’Riordan recalled an idyllic childhood – warm beds, hearty dinners, a fair dose of spirituality – but, in 2013, she told the Irish Independent that between the ages of eight and 12 she had been sexually abused by a family friend. Throughout her life she would flip, in interviews, between poetic positivity and confession.The heady combination of raw, emotional lyrics and evocative Irish flavours quickly caught the attention of the wider world: the very first song O’Riordan wrote for the band was Linger, and it remains their biggest hit. Although their debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can’t We?, tanked the first time round, after two US tours Linger was put on heavy rotation by MTV and upon its rerelease the album went to No 1 in the UK. By 1995, it had sold 5m copies in the US. It is being reissued in a box set next month.Despite their huge commercial success, the Cranberries were never exactly cool in a UK smitten with Britpop the US was always their second home, where Irish connections were felt so strongly. O’Riordan wrote an international protest song in Zombie, her response to the IRA bombing that killed two children, Jonathan Ball and Tim Parry, in Warrington in 1993. Its lyric was so powerfully abstract that Parry’s father, Colin, only realised, on O’Riordan’s death, what had inspired it. Their label was wary of the track’s politics, but the band were not.“In the 30 years with Dolores, what she wanted to do lyrically was her thing we never interfered,” says Noel. “That first album was all about relationships that she’d had through her teenage years, and to stand there and spurt that out to everyone, you could open yourself to ridicule – but she didn’t care. That remained with her always. She wrote what she felt was right.”When fame hit, they were all about 20. It was always tougher for Dolores, says Mike, being on the front of the local paper, buying fish fingers at the supermarket. She broke her leg badly on a group ski trip during the recording of their second album – she wrote songs from her hospital bed – and, during her protracted convalescence, she began to struggle with depression and anorexia. By 1999, she was listed as the fifth-richest woman in the British Isles, but fame was wrecking her nervous system. By 2003, the band were “burned out”: they saw very little of each other for six years, with O’Riordan living in Canada with her husband, Don Burton, and their three young children. There was a reunion in 2009, but you get the sense of a band kept on their toes by an unpredictable leader.“She would say we needed some time off and a week later she would be bored,” says Noel. “Her emails were like text messages. Fifteen of them, but they’re all like two lines, at two o’clock in the morning …”“Sometimes when you did want time off you’d be dreading seeing her ringing,” his brother smiles.After her split from Burton, she spent a period living in hotels in New York. In 2016, she had a drunken and paranoid episode on a flight from JFK to Shannon and assaulted the cabin crew, reminding them who she was. Shortly afterwards, she invited the Irish journalist Barry Egan into her home and told him how much trouble she was in it was a cry for help from someone who had grown up in the public eye and who possibly struggled in periods of relative obscurity. “My life has no control,” she said. Shortly afterwards, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. How much did the band know about her problems in her later years?“It was only the last few years that she started talking about psychological problems, because she didn’t know herself,” says Lawler. “She saw a few different therapists and realised what she had and she started getting treatment for it.”“She was a lot more herself,” says Noel. “Especially last year, when we were rehearsing: you wouldn’t even know, because they had found the right cocktail of whatever it was she needed to be on. There wasn’t even a case of having to ‘work around it’. The hardest thing was her back, because playing live she could not move as freely as she used to.” The new album gave her something to focus on, he says. “She was really psyched about getting back out and really looking forward to China, because that was a big tour for us.“Dolores had an awful lot going on and she was on a roll of being able to write,” he continues. “Lyrically, the new album is very strong. She always said she found it hard to write songs when she was happy. She always said: put a bit of misery in her life and it was easier.“We will do this album and then that will be it,” he adds. “There is no need to continue.”The band step out on to the balcony to do the photoshoot.

But voluntourism supports a system that is breaking up familiesBaby rescue is the ultimate volunteer experience. At Hope of Life International, a Christian mission in rural Guatemala, a rescue team springs into action when news arrives that a baby is dangerously ill in a nearby mountain village. The mission, which hosts hundreds of volunteers from North America every month, sends a caravan of Jeeps, canoes and an ambulance to bring the child to its hospital. On the charity’s website, you can see photos of volunteers, their faces rapt with grim determination, walking down a steep mountain path or fording a river, holding tiny babies wrapped in blankets. A video shows dramatic scenes in which Carlos Vargas, Hope of Life’s founder, rescues a baby alongside volunteers, the music pulsing and urgent. “Every second, every minute matters,” Vargas says. “Maybe if we reach her an hour late, we lose her.”Hope of Life has scouts who work in these mountain villages, looking for sick infants. Although time is of the essence, when they find an ailing baby, the scouts do not bring them directly to the hospital. Instead, they alert the organisation, which assembles a team, accompanied by volunteers, to collect them. Many volunteers who come to Hope of Life are drawn by the dream of taking part in one of these expeditions: they get to save lives, and have a transformational encounter. One woman wrote in a blogpost about her experience: “This is what we came for. This is what I have been waiting for. This is what they’ve been waiting for.”Every year, millions of people from wealthy nations travel to poor countries, hoping to do good. University students want to spend a school break or part of a summer giving back, perhaps even to improve their CV. Christians go with their churches for one- or two-week missions. All seek personal growth, connection to those less fortunate, and the satisfaction of making a difference. For many, the destination is an orphanage, where they aim to bring joy to needy children in the brief time they can spare.The aspiration to help the most vulnerable children is a noble one, but the booming business of “voluntourism” sustains practices and institutions that actually do harm. There is no such thing as a “good” orphanage, according to child development experts. Eighty years of research confirms that children do best in a family. They are far more likely to experience abuse, cruelty or neglect in an institution than in any other setting. Even in a well-run facility, children do not develop normally.In wealthy countries, the institutionalisation of children has almost completely stopped. Instead, governments offer services that can help families keep children with them if that is not possible, they seek adoptive parents or foster families. These solutions are imperfect. Some foster families are abusive children, especially those most in need of a steady home, can get shuffled from one family to another. “But nobody is advocating going back to institutions,” says Philip Goldman, the founder and president of Maestral International, a Minneapolis-based organisation that advises on social welfare and child protection.Almost every poor country, by contrast, still puts children in institutions, even though the vast majority of those children have families. Wealthy countries, who consider orphanages harmful for their own children, nonetheless provide a stream of charitable giving that makes orphanages viable businesses abroad. And orphanages need “orphans”. Parents may hand over children because they have special needs, or because the family can’t afford to send them to school. “It’s a huge pull factor: if they can get food, health care, education, specialised services, parents make a decision they think is in the best interests of the children,” says Shannon Senefeld, senior vice president for overseas operations at Catholic Relief Services.In Cambodia, 40 years after the Khmer Rouge genocide, the number of orphanages has been growing, according to the UN. The reason is demand – but not from abandoned children. Instead, it comes from a huge rise in Australian tourists willing to pay to work in them.Voluntourism is an outgrowth of the ecotourism movement of the 1990s. According to Pippa Biddle, author of a forthcoming book on voluntourism, travellers rebelled against package trips and resorts and wanted a more authentic experience – and they were willing to pay for it. Many charities in developing countries run such programmes and collect fees from volunteers. “It used to be if you wanted to volunteer abroad, you wrote letters to overseas contacts,” says Claire Bennett, co-author of Learning Service: The Essential Guide to Volunteering Abroad. “Now you can buy a volunteer experience with a few clicks.” The newest trend is corporations sending employees to volunteer. It’s a team-building exercise and associates the brand with good works. Hope of Life, the Christian mission in Guatemala, has built an executive conference centre for just this purpose.Voluntourism may be fuelled by noble feelings, but it is built on perverse economics. Many organisations offer volunteers the chance to dig wells, build schools and do other construction projects in poor villages. It’s easy to understand why it’s done this way: if a charity hired locals for its unskilled work, it would be spending money. If it uses volunteers who pay to be there, it’s raising money.But the last thing a Guatemalan highland village needs is imported unskilled labour. People are desperate for jobs. Public works serve the community better and last longer when locals do them. Besides, long-term change happens when people can solve their own problems, rather than having things done for them.“There are few things more cringeworthy than watching 20 British schoolgirls trying to build a well under the scalding Nepalese heat,” one Durham University student wrote about her trip to an orphanage. Villagers, wary of offending their visitors, say nothing. An American volunteer in Tanzania recalled: “We … were so bad at the most basic construction work that each night the men had to take down the structurally unsound bricks we had laid and rebuild the structure so that, when we woke up in the morning, we would be unaware of our failure.”Defenders of voluntourism maintain that its real value is to change the visitor. But while it’s definitely more transformational for the visitor than the host, it’s not clear how significant the effects are. A study of 162 Americans who travelled to Honduras to build houses after Hurricane Mitch in 1998 found that years later, this work had made no difference to their giving or volunteering. And even if the houses they built didn’t fall over, they were expensive. The houses in Honduras built by international volunteers cost $30,000 apiece, including airfare, while local Christian organisations could build them for $2,000. If well-wishers had contributed money instead of labour, 15 times more houses could have been built. The helpful choice would have been to stay at home.Money goes far in poor countries. Two thousand dollars can pay for a week-long trip by an unskilled American volunteer – or it could pay the salary of a village teacher for four months. “If the church in the US would simply tithe, with just half that increase in giving, you could feed, clothe and medically treat the entire developing world,” says Daryl Fulp, an American missionary who works with disabled children in Guatemala.If children go to institutions because their families are poor, the solution would seem to be working to reduce poverty rather than building and funding more institutions. But institutions become the solution because governments don’t have – or are not willing to spend – money for anti-poverty work. Funding for orphanages, by contrast, just drops from the sky. In many poor countries, it dwarfs funding for every other kind of relief or development work.In Haiti, some 30,000 children live in orphanages. Lumos found that these institutions get at least $100m a year in foreign donations. That is half the total amount of US aid to Haiti last year, five times the budget of Haiti’s social affairs ministry, and 130 times the country’s child protection budget.Hope of Life, which occupies a 3,000-acre complex in the mountains about a four-hour drive from Guatemala City, is one of the biggest organisations offering an emotionally charged tourist experience. The orphanage, founded in 1989 by Vargas and his American wife, Cheryl, now houses 195 children, at least 60 of them with disabilities. Volunteers pay between $750 and $1,000 to come and work for a week: the higher sum gets you an air-conditioned suite with private bathroom. (Baby rescue is extra: one man who takes employees of his company on trips to Hope of Life told me his group pays $1,500 for a baby rescue trip.) When I visited this year, the lunch I ate was excellent, the swimming pool I saw spectacular. There’s a zoo, with a lion, tiger, crocodile and jaguar.Lourdes Milian, who manages Hope of Life day-to-day, said that during summer and school vacations, about 400 volunteers come every week, and, on average, 150 during other weeks. Volunteers, then, bring at least $9m a year to Hope of Life.Hope of Life had a budget of $15.7m in 2016, which funds its many programmes: projects in villages to dig wells and build schools, baby rescue, the feeding centre, the hospital. But when I visited, it seemed clear that not much money was being spent on its most vulnerable, disabled residents, while a lot of investment has gone towards making the volunteer experience as comfortable as possible – and as emotionally rewarding. I asked Katie Arriaza, the daughter of Carlos and Cheryl – she is president and chief executive of Hope of Life International – why they put so much emphasis on bringing volunteers to rescue babies.And yet, in a sense, a tourist event is exactly what it seems to be. Hope of Life’s baby rescue saves dying children. But it also appears to be an expensive and inefficient way to do so. On its website, Hope of Life says that the children are sick because “their parents are too poor to help them”. Instead of stepping in when a child is close to death, it would seem that Hope of Life could save more children if it simply gave vulnerable families the equivalent of a few dollars a month to buy food.Governments all over the world are eager to let foreign-funded institutions take care of vulnerable children – because it means they don’t have to. Otto Rivera, who coordinates a group of a dozen Guatemalan organisations working for children’s rights, said that Guatemala spends a dollar a day per child – and half of that goes to education. “There is 50 cents left for health, food, protection and culture,” he said. “The government has no capacity or will to have an integral vision of the rights of children.”There is no room in the budget for oversight of institutions. Cases of neglect, cruelty, sexual and physical abuse and sex trafficking are widespread at orphanages. Nowhere in recent times was this more shockingly revealed than at an orphanage near Guatemala City called Hogar Seguro.On 7 March 2017, dozens of teenage girls escaped from Hogar Seguro Virgen de la Asunción (the name means “Secure Home”), an institution that housed more than 700 children, 173 of whom had disabilities. The place was a medieval hell. It had no reliable count of residents, which meant that children could disappear easily. Guatemala’s human rights ombudsman had found that abuse and trafficking were taking place. Girls said that staff abused them, raped them, took them out at night and prostituted them, but no action was taken.The girls who escaped were caught, returned and locked in a classroom overnight with just some thin mattresses. In the morning, one girl set a mattress on fire to get the police to open the door. It remained closed. Later, police and paramedics carried out charred bodies. Of the 56 girls, 41 died. The others were seriously wounded.The deaths at Hogar Seguro closed the last of Guatemala’s giant public children’s institutions. Three top officials, including the former social welfare secretary, are scheduled to be tried, beginning in February 2019. The surviving children were scattered. Some turned 18 and left the system. One child entered a foster home. Foster care is a promising new initiative in Guatemala, but when I visited, there were fewer than 40 foster families in the country – not nearly enough to cover the need. The government reported that it sent 223 children back to their families, although it was unclear whether they would get the support they might need.The inter-American commission on human rights instructed Guatemala to keep the Hogar Seguro children out of institutions, but 180 children, 120 of them with disabilities, were placed in other facilities, both state-run and some of Guatemala’s more than 125 registered private institutions (there are probably many more that are unregistered). More than 40 children from Hogar Seguro ended up at Hope of Life.In March, Lisbet Brizuela of Disability Rights International (DRI), an advocacy organisation based in Washington DC, took a small team around Guatemala to visit the places now housing Hogar Seguro’s disabled children, to check on their care. They visited 11 public and private institutions. In one Catholic children’s home, Albergue del Hermano Pedro, Disability Rights found four teenagers lying on mats with their hands tied behind their back, in what was called the rehabilitation room. At Virgen del Socorro, another Catholic home, girls were held in cages. All children with disabilities were tied to chairs or wheelchairs, even those who could walk.I went along on some of the DRI inspections. We visited two new state-run group homes for boys and young men with mental disabilities. They were obviously much more humane than Hogar Seguro – but they were chaotic, impersonal and lacking stimulation. Children from Hogar Seguro had survived terrible trauma. We saw plenty of psychiatric medicines, but no sign of trauma care.At Hope of Life, the most severely disabled children live together in a building called Kelly’s House, with four rooms, each with between eight and 11 children. There they sleep and spend most of the day, in the care of two staff members a room. Three of the rooms house kids who came from Hogar Seguro. Some are sitting in wheelchairs, some are rocking or walking back and forth. The rooms have cribs and some beds but are otherwise bare. There are few toys, almost nothing on the walls, nothing for children to look at or do, although Arriaza, the chief executive, told me there was a day in the past two months when the children were able to play with small animals, such as rabbits.Volunteers have reported concerns. One mission volunteer at Hope for Life wrote on a church blog: “The more time I spent there, the more my heart broke for these special needs kids. They need more trained carers, physical therapists and speech therapists. But as it is now, they are understaffed and the staff they have is not educated enough to handle the children they care for. Kelly’s House has a lot of great equipment that has been donated but it is sitting unused because they don’t have professionals to teach them to use it.”Arriaza said that a therapist would be coming soon from the US and would stay for a month, teaching the staff new techniques for helping the children. I asked how much stimulation the children received. “We have cognitive therapists who play with colours and different things,” she said.One Guatemalan government official – a woman highly respected for her seriousness and dedication – had told the DRI inspectors before their visit to Guatemala that the government was launching an innovative way to care for some of the children, along with some adults, with mental disabilities. In Quetzaltenango, a four-hour drive from Guatemala City, we visited this new government care initiative, called Nidia Martínez, and were disappointed to find it was another institution. The land it was built on had become available, we were told, and it was decided that building a new care home was easier and faster than setting up any kind of family-based structure. Housing a child in an institution costs six to 10 times as much as family-based care, but setting up the necessary support for families requires dedication, know-how and planning.The Nidia Martínez buildings were new, clean and spacious, with 80 beds. The rows of bunk beds in the girls’ room had pink Disney princess blankets. The residents were dancing to music (perhaps for our benefit). Most of the staff had come from Hogar Seguro. It was impossible to tell how implicated they had been in what went on there, since there has never been any investigation.The medical expert on the DRI inspection team was Matt Mason, clinical director of the Georgetown University Center for Child and Human Development. I asked him how many of the children we saw could live – if they had help – with their own or other families.“All of them,” Mason said.When I was 16, I worked for a summer at St Francis Home for Orphan Boys in Detroit, as part of a Jewish youth group, 10 teenagers from all around Michigan. St Francis was a forbidding, five-storey brick building. I helped care for a group of boys aged eight and nine. My job was to offer them inidual attention. I spent much of the day taking long walks around the grounds with one boy at a time.As at other institutions, my boys were not orphans. On the weekend, many got visits, and some went home. Some had behavioural problems that their parents couldn’t handle. In other families, their parents had the problems and lost custody as a result. In both cases, the boys needed help. As far as I remember, they got no treatment whatsoever for their problems. Some of the boys came from families that were simply poor. One boy was at St Francis with his younger brother because their father, who worked at the Ford plant, was alone and could not afford childcare.At the end of the summer, as teenagers do, I cried about whether I had made a lasting difference in their lives – and as teenagers do, I wrote poetry about it. One boy, Rodrick, had given me a ring of his own making when I left. This was part of one of my poems:I still have the ring, a circle of wire I sometimes wear. But what do you still have of me to tell you that I once was there?I now understand that I did leave Rodrick with something: a sense of abandonment. Every single boy in that institution already had abandonment issues. If it was hard for me to leave these boys behind, how much harder was it for them to see me go? And the next adult who came for a few weeks? And the next one? They might have learned that there are people who love them and will take them on walks. But they also learned that these people always leave.St Francis closed in 1992. The United States doesn’t use orphanages any more. Nor does Britain. No matter how well-run the orphanage, it cannot provide what children most need: a parent. When volunteers turn up at an orphanage and children run to hug them, it’s understandable that they feel they are providing much-needed love and attention. But children shouldn’t turn to random strangers for affection. When they do, it means they can’t develop healthy attachments. And a parade of short-term adults to hug them makes it worse.What puts children in crisis isn’t something hugs can solve. Andrea Freidus, an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of North Carolina, wrote that voluntourism gets in the way of recognising the structural issues that create humanitarian crises. “My research suggests that students who engage in these programmes actually contribute towards the mystification of larger systems that produce inequality, poverty, particular patterns of disease distribution and various forms of violence.”In a 2012 essay on what he dubbed “the White Saviour Industrial Complex,” the novelist Teju Cole pleaded for humility. It is “not about justice,” Cole wrote. “It is about having a big emotional experience that validates privilege.” Voluntourism, he argued, perpetuates the myth that change happens as a result of expressions of caring from rich white people.Romania, infamous for keeping many thousands of children in institutions during the Ceauşescu years, has now greatly reduced its institutionalisation of children. So have Bulgaria and China. A consortium of Lumos, Maestral and Catholic Relief Services is starting to work in Haiti, Guatemala, Lebanon, India, Kenya, Moldova and Indonesia to help these countries move from institutional care to family care.Sudan, where civil war has left many children without protection, has created a system of emergency foster care and adoption. Rwanda aims to have zero children in institutions by 2020. It has turned orphanages into day-care centres and retrained staff as day-care workers. It supports and monitors families who take in children. “Rwanda is a poster child for de-institutionalisation,” says Philip Goldman at Maestral. “They have placed four out of five children in safe, nurturing, monitored homes.”Almost all of the children who remain in institutions in Rwanda are disabled. Families abandon these children because they might require unaffordable equipment or medicine. They might need care that a working parent cannot provide. In some places, disability is seen as a curse. Once institutionalised, a disabled child almost never leaves.The support and monitoring required in family care is more challenging to set up than placing a child in an orphanage, and far harder for children with disabilities. “I don’t think that’s impossible,” says Shannon Senefeld, from Catholic Relief Services. “But it requires case management for each inidual child.” And it requires families willing to care for children with complex needs. “The government cannot create those families by fiat,” says Jedd Medefind, the president of the Christian Alliance for Orphans, a group that seeks to direct short-term church missions towards family care instead of orphanages.Such families do exist. Daryl and Wanda Fulp, Christian missionaries, came to Guatemala from Ohio in 2007 to adopt their son John – their third adopted child with special needs (they also have five biological children and two adopted children they had fostered). During the trip they visited an institution for disabled children and left weeping at the conditions they saw. They sold their possessions in Ohio, moved to a large house outside the city of Antigua and began taking in children with severe disabilities, including those near death.The Fulps’ Hope for Home feels like a chaotic, giant family doing what it can for 25 children with disabilities. Caring for any of them could be a full-time job. Local authorities call frequently asking them to take new children, and they have no reliable source of funds. The place runs on the family’s faith – the Fulps’ adult children and their spouses make up a lot of the staff – and on Daryl’s charisma and energy. But even he sometimes seems overwhelmed by the need, and the deaths of so many children.The Fulps’ pioneering work aims to help families keep their disabled children at home. Because so many children are disabled due to cerebral palsy, which can result from injury during birth, in August Hope for Home opened a birthing centre, run by a midwife who is training other midwives. Hope for Home also has three teams of people, who visit some 150 families with disabled children. Donors – mainly Christians in the US who follow Fulp on his blog – sponsor the families, providing between $10 and $200 a month to cover what the family needs.Families get free monthly visits from a nurse and from a physical therapist who trains them to do therapy with their child. They get free medical appointments with private doctors, transport to appointments and whatever else they need to keep their children: special formula, medicines, wheelchairs, leg braces. Crucially, Hope for Home also provides food for the whole family if needed – thus turning a disabled child from a serious economic liability into a modest asset. Disability Rights observed that keeping children in institutions costs the state more than 15 times what Hope for Home pays to keep children with their families.In March, Lisbet Brizuela of Disability Rights and I went to see the family of 14-year-old Walter, who has spina bifida, hydrocephaly and hearing loss. His mother said that until Walter was six, the family carried him everywhere. But then they met Fulp, who brought Walter a wheelchair. When Walter outgrew the first chair, Fulp brought him a new one. Fulp has brought braces for Walter’s feet and treatments for pressure sores. He is also paying school fees.That day we also saw Sayli, who was 14 months old. Fulp had met her 10 days before, and recognised the signs of cerebral palsy. It is hard to imagine a family less equipped to deal with a child with her complicated needs. Sayli lives with her mother, Yulisi López, 20, her grandmother, 42, and six of López’s young siblings. They all live in one room and sleep on one mattress. Only two of the school-age children go to school. Sayli was thin and sickly, and suffered from frequent respiratory infections. A week before our visit, Fulp had brought special formula for Sayli. He also brought a laundry basket containing 18kg of food: dried beans, rice, corn flour for tortillas, oatmeal, powdered milk, sugar.Fulp told the family that Sayli had an appointment with a neurologist, and he had arranged transport for her and her mother. “My friends will come here and get you, and then bring you back home,” he told López. He said he understood they were devastated by the news about Sayli’s condition, but promised to find a sponsor to supply the $80 a month the family needed to stay together and survive. He prayed with them. “The good news is we’re going to walk with you,” he told the family. “You are not alone.”Organisations around the world have been working for years to end orphanage tourism. Their work is starting to bear fruit. Australia is now discouraging the practice, and the Australian parliament is considering a law to label orphanage tourism as child trafficking and ban it entirely. In July, the UK international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, announced that the government’s foreign aid programme would now support family- and community-based care for all children. In May 2016, the London School of Economics set up a consortium of universities pledging not to advertise orphanage placements to their students.Many major tourism companies – for example, Global Crossroad – still prominently feature orphanage work. Nancy McGehee, a professor of hospitality and tourism management at Virginia Tech University, says that companies send representatives to speak on campuses. But some companies are closing their voluntourism programmes. The International Volunteer HQ announced that it would stop sending volunteers to orphanages by March 2019. Projects Abroad stopped in January 2018. “I don’t think we’ve lost any business from it,” says Jessi Warner, chief operating officer of Projects Abroad. “Quite often someone will phone and say: ‘I want to work in orphanages.’ When our team explains why we don’t do that, everyone is open to it. They often join our community care programmes. It’s just about awareness.”Some religious groups are also trying to channel efforts into family and community care. The Catholic church has set up more orphanages than any organisation in history, but is now changing its policies. “We recognise we were part of the problem and we had to really work to change,” says Senefeld. The Christian Alliance for Orphans recently published a guide for short-term volunteers working with children. It advised groups running trips for volunteers to commit to the best interest of each child first, over the visitors’ emotional needs. Jedd Medefind, the president, said that volunteers could switch from directly caring for children to supporting local caregivers. It’s a question of managing expectations, he said.“This is a huge, committed, passionate, motivated population willing to do just about anything to care for these kids,” says Nicole Wilke, research fellow at the Christian Alliance. “These people are not the enemy. They are the solution here. If we don’t want them going into orphanages, what do we have for them?”For some people, the answer might be nothing. “We are competing with that incredible emotional reward of walking into an institution and having 10 kids jump into your arms,” says Goldman, of Maestral International. “It’s something very difficult to replicate.”McGehee at Virginia Tech would like to see voluntourism recast as “transformational tourism”, with visitors rewarded by gaining a better understanding of people’s lives, and the way the economics of charity work. By all means, visit people who need help, she says. “But do it beside me and hear who I am. Get to know me and not all those stereotypes about me. And then go home and see if there’s something you’re doing that somehow perpetuates my situation.”Support for this article was provided by a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0434b1380270e6bcc35fe23314db7bf4ee2556c3/0_0_3876_2585/master/3876.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0f11105bea175ff3e4108edf6967e56 700w","title":"day to day effects of no deal brexit stressed in new impact papers","story":"Licences, passports and phone bills among topics explored in fresh batch of papers released on Thursday The impact that a no-deal Brexit could have on driving licences, passports and phone bills will be spelled out as the government releases a batch of papers on Thursday warning of the risks of crashing out of the European Union.A sudden exit from the EU would mean that the mutual recognition of driving licences would automatically end, creating a headache for the 11,600 lorry drivers who cross the Channel each day as well as car-driving tourists.On passports, there have been warnings that Britons travelling abroad with less than six months to expiry could be stopped at the border of an EU member state, when they would previously have been let through.Cross-border mobile phone bills could soar in the event of a no-deal Brexit if the phone companies pass on the costs of higher roaming and data charges that would follow.The papers will be published after Theresa May chairs a special meeting of the cabinet focused on how a no-deal outcome could be handled.The Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, said he believed the no-deal papers were “part and parcel of our sensible, pragmatic approach to preparing for all outcomes”, but added: “Getting a deal with the EU is still by far and away the most likely outcome.”Papers on driving licences, passports and mobile phone roaming are among the 30 or so technical notices that the government will release after the cabinet’s three-hour meeting.Raab also confirmed that the government would withhold a “very substantial” part of the £39bn orce bill agreed with the EU if no deal could be reached.He said: “We would always be mindful of our strict legal obligations, but we wouldn’t pay the quantum which is currently under the withdrawal agreement.”Asked how much the government was threatening to withhold, he said: “I’m not putting a number on it. It is not a threat it is a statement of fact as part of our no-deal planning. Yes, we would be mindful of our strict legal obligations but the amount and the phased way it is set out in the withdrawal agreement would fall away because there would be no deal.”He added: “There is a very significant substantial difference between our strict legal obligations and the negotiated settlement as part of the withdrawal agreement arrangements.”The Brexit secretary said that the government hopes that enough MPs will back a deal based on the Chequers plan, out of fear of the alternative.“There will be a binary choice between a deal and no deal and I believe that will focus minds,” he said. The no-deal papers being released on Thursday are an attempt to show that Britain is seriously planning for a no-deal Brexit in order to strengthen its negotiating hand with Brussels, although Theresa May has repeatedly said that she would prefer to strike a withdrawal deal with the EU by November that would than have to be ratified by parliament.A first batch released last month revealed Britons could be liable for higher credit card charges in the case of a no-deal Brexit on 29 March2019.The second set of risk assessments are also expected to touch on security concerns, with papers expected on firearms and precursor drugs. But a paper on aviation that had been anticipated – amid warnings that planes could be grounded in an extreme scenario – is not due to appear.Ministers have previously indicated that each batch of no-deal papers will raise more serious issues than before.

Scientists recently discovered that all of today’s domestic cats descend from one subspecies of African wildcat, and that our ancestors could be ided into cat or dog people as early as the stone age.Perhaps the ultimate “cat people” were the Egyptians, who worshipped our feline friends to such an extent that they imposed the death penalty for killing one, shaved their eyebrows in grief when theirs died, and had them mummified and placed in purr-amids in readiness for the kitty afterlife. For ancient Romans, Felis silvestris catus was a symbol of liberty and an effective form of pest control. It was cats’ mice-bothering skills that allowed them to pad across Asia, where dedicated mousers protected silkworm cocoons and treasured manuscripts from rodents.The middle ages were a bit of a low period in the history of catkind, as felines were cast as symbols of “sinful” female sexuality and witchcraft by the church. In Malleus Maleficarum, the medieval treatise on witchcraft usually translated as The Witch Hammer, a 13th-century folk story depicts three witches that turn themselves into cats and attack a man. From then on witches were believed to have cats as sidekicks, or to change into feline form in the night. But by the 15th century, cats were coming back into favour, helped in part by the legend of Dick Whittington, who made his fortune thanks to his rat-killing kitty. This kitty may or may not have worn boots in real life – and may or may not have sounded like Antonio Banderas.It was around this time that cat-fans started breeding moggies for particular coat colours and textures. Kitty genetics is a fascinating field. Cats come in two dominant colours – black and red – that are “diluted” or “masked” to become “blue” (appearing grey) or “cream”. The red colour is only carried on the X chromosome, which is why tortoiseshell cats are nearly always female, and ginger cats are nearly always male. (This is all great trivia with which to impress your cat-loving andor geneticist friends, by the way.)There have been many “crazy cat ladies” – and gentlemen, for that matter – throughout history, notably Cardinal Richelieu (AKA the baddie in The Three Musketeers), who had 14 cats at the time of his death in 1642, including Ludovic le Cruel, so named because of his savage dedication to killing rats. Catherine the Great of Russia turned the Winter Palace into a cattery, with her favoured breed of Russian blues running wild upstairs and a basement full of “working cats” that she promoted to guard status, complete with salaries and extra food rations. Winston Churchill kept cats at Chartwell, while Abraham Lincoln was such a cat obsessive that he fed his kittens Tabby and Dixy at the table at a state dinner, and regularly took in strays to the White House.As cats became a popular indoor pet – no doubt helped by the invention of cat litter in 1947 – they clawed their way into popular culture, too. Whole essays have been written on the cartoon cat, from Sylvester the Cat, who first appeared in 1939, right up to Pokémon’s Meowth, via Felix, Top Cat, Garfield, Bagpuss and the Aristocats. Not to forget Alice’s Cheshire Cat, which also appeared in cartoon form in the 1951 Disney film.In a nod to the feline’s medieval association with evil, cats also became the purr-fect accomplice for witches, Bond villains and, in homage, Mike Myers’s Dr Evil. They were also the animal ally of choice for breakfasters at Tiffany’s, the alien-battling Ripley in the otherwise very non-furry Alien films, and leather-loving Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman herself in Batman Returns.But it’s the internet that has taken cats from much-loved pet to feline overlord. From “I can has cheezburger” memes to Grumpy Cat, via the 52 million people who have watched a ginger cat called Fatso play a keyboard, Brits share 3.8m cat pictures and videos every day. Meanwhile, social media has made stars of some pampered pusses, such as Karl Lagerfeld’s fluffy white Birman, Choupette (112.4k followers), Kitty Purry (Katy Perry’s cat) and Taylor Swift’s two cats, who now have their own merchandise line, the Meredith and Olivia Swift collection.But before memes there was poetry. In the ninth century, an Irish monk wrote a poem about his cat, Pangur Bán. For Baudelaire, the cat’s meow was the very source of his verse. When Romantic poet Robert Southey’s cat, Rumpelstiltskin, finally went for his great catnap in the sky, Southey wrote: “There should be a court mourning in Catland.” Meanwhile, Thomas Gray was composing an Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat Drowned in a Tub of Goldfishes. If only they’d been alive in 2002, when the first cloned kitten – the aptly named “CC” – was born.And while Kristen Roupenian’s viral New Yorker short story Cat Person could stake a claim, the most famous feline work of literature has to be TS Eliot’s Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats. Fitting, then, that Andrew Lloyd Webber’s record-breaking 1981 musical version is about to get a big screen reboot, starring – who else? – contemporary cat woman Taylor Swift.

Here’s what your cat’s age really means – and how to handle the changes that come with itOnce kittens pass the newborn phase, where they should be with their mothers, and begin to grow and engage with the outside world, they will discover play. Kitten play mimics moves that would be used for hunting such as stalking, ambushing and pawing. Help your kitten hone these skills, which also keep them active, by making time to play with them using age- and size-appropriate toys.TrainingToilet training should start using a size-appropriate litter tray as soon as your kitten comes home. Gentle grooming and recall training can start now too, use treats to encourage them to respond to their name when called, or use a clicker just before you feed them so they associate that with reward.FeedingWeaned kittens do not need any kind of cat or kitten milk, but they do need a good quality protein-rich food. “Kittens have immature digestive systems and so need an easily digestible food, and once they have stopped feeding from their mother they need to build up their own immunity, so food must have the right nutrients, such as an antioxidant complex, to help bridge the gap while they are developing their own systems,” explains Hannah Poile, scientific communications manager at Royal Canin.Kittens go from sucking, to licking to crunching a kibble, so food that is hydratable is desirable. “A growth formula with calcium and phosphorous in the right levels to promote skeletal growth is also best for them at this stage,” says Poile.Between three and six months your kitten is headed towards sexual maturity, so it’s best to have your kitty neutered (and microchipped). Liaise with your vet around exact timings. After neutering it’s best to change to a specific neutered kitten diet, this will ensure they’re still getting all the nutrients they need for healthy growth, but will take into account the specific needs following this procedure.Your kitten should be fully grown by 12 months, unless it is a larger breed such as a Maine coon, which may not reach its adult size until around 15 months. During this phase – you could refer to it as the equivalent of teenage years in humans – your cat will become more demanding of both their owner and the world they live in. Keep them entertained by making sure there is plenty to stimulate them mentally and physically.Continue with grooming and introduce ear and teeth checks, perhaps follow this up with attention and affection rather than treats to prevent any issues with weight.FeedingAn appropriate older kitten food that will give the right level of nutrition for this second growth phase is best, along with food that specifically promotes balance in their intestinal flora is also recommended.This is prime time for your cat: they should be physically fit and well, with a glossy coat, bright eyes and plenty of get up and go. They will be hunting regularly (if they have access to outside spaces) or play hunting if an indoor cat.At this stage, your cat will respond well to games, so keep their toys varied and available, especially for indoor cats keep their weight monitored, teeth clean and stay up to date with worming, flea treatments and annual boosters.FeedingAged 12 months it’s time to transition your cat from kitten to adult food. “Make sure you are feeding it an activity-appropriate diet. Are they an indoor or an outdoor cat?” says Poile. “Indoor cats are generally less active and, if not fed a diet with the right level of calories, can easily gain weight.”“Naturally, cats eat little and often – they are grazers and will have up to 15 sittings a day. If you are supporting the species as it would eat naturally you would have food down for them so they can go back to it when they want it, activity feeders are great for encouraging natural feeding habits.”By the age of seven your cat will start to experience the early and often invisible changes that come with ageing. They may be more prone to weight gain, dental problems and joint issues. Help by making sure they keep active through play and monitor any changes in their coat, behaviour or feeding pattern. Encourage activity with a variety of mixed toys. Make sure they have to work a bit to get their food – they enjoy seeking it out.FeedingHelp to support your cat as they start to face the first signs of ageing with a diet adapted to this life stage containing targeted nutrients, such as vitamins and green tea polyphenols, to help maintain their vitality. Don’t forget to keep checking your cat’s body condition score and adapt their feeding amounts to keep them at a healthy bodyweight.At this age, your cat is likely to start to experience age-related health issues such as joint pain, a reduction in kidney function, weight loss and a decline in activity. They can also become fussy about food and may be less able to adapt to changes in their environment, so it’s best not to introduce any major changes to their routine or domestic life. Your cat may begin to show signs of cognitive dysfunction towards the older end of this life stage, monitor their behaviour for signs of confusion, which should be discussed with your vet.Feeding“A senior diet is very important for this age group,” says Poile. “Just as with kittens, older cats need food that supports their changing appetites, many older cats become fussier about their diet and may appreciate an adapted kibble or wet food. Kidney health is also a concern as cats age and it is important for regular checkups at the vet, as well as to feed a diet with an adapted level of phosphorous.”The elderly cat can struggle with regulating body temperature and have fairly extensive dental issues – oral disease or tooth loss can make eating difficult. So, it’s important to provide a palatable and digestible diet.Your cat may lose weight for no obvious reason, monitor their condition, coat and overall behaviour. Any concerns should be raised with your vet. They may struggle to groom regularly as they become less flexible, so maintain regular grooming sessions with them.Your cat is likely to sleep more and can be prone to senile changes. They can seem to be lost, unable to find their food or water or usual sleeping place, so be there to care for them.FeedingAs cats age, their bodies are less able to process and get nutrients from their food, so weight loss can occur. Be sure to feed them an age-appropriate food that has a high palatability and increased calorie content. Older cats can have issues with their sense of smell so a food with a rich aroma can help.All kittens should be fed according to the size they will become as an adult cat.

As a consequence it spent the most on compensation packages (£184.8m).We’d like your help to find out more about current or future cuts to UK council services.

One of our journalists may be in touch and we will consider some of your responses in our reporting. You can read terms of service\u0026nbsphere.Manchester city council carried out nearly 4,000 redundancies over the period (at a cost of £75.4m), followed by Lancashire county council (3,815, costing £89.3m), Liverpool city council (3,621, costing £71.3m), and Sheffield city council (3,616, at £66.2m).The figures are likely to be an underestimate because they refer only to staff directly employed by councils and do not include redundancies made by private firms who provide municipal services under outsourcing contracts.Although the biggest councils predictably saw the highest total job losses, authorities in the north of England were proportionately worst hit. There were eight council job cuts per 1,000 head of population in the north-east, six per 1,000 in the north-west and West Midlands, and four per thousand in Yorkshire and Humber.This compared to four per thousand in London, three job cuts per 1,000 population in the south-east and south-west regions, and two per thousand in the east Midlands.David Paine, a LGC journalist , who carried out the research, said the figures did not reflect large pay-offs to top council executives. “The vast majority of the money will have gone to lower-paid staff members whose jobs and livelihoods have been destroyed by austerity.”The research shows that the biggest wave of redundancies during the period occurred in 2011-12, when 42,834 jobs were lost. The total fell each subsequent year as the scope for additional savings progressively shrunk. There were 17,969 in 2017-18 at a cost of £325m.Rob Whiteman, chief executive of the public sector accountants body Cipfa, said: “This scale of job losses reflects the intense financial pressure on councils as they now have no option other than to provide the bare minimum statutory provisions and are having to reduce spending on more discretionary areas such as libraries, cultural and youth services, which they would all want to provide but no longer have the capacity and funding to do so.”Many councils are preparing for a fresh round of cuts in a bid to stave off insolvency. Somerset county council yesterday announced it would make up to 130 staff redundant and make big cuts to children’s social care services as part of a two-year programme aimed at saving £28m.The council, which was warned in May that its deteriorating finances put it at risk of going bust, said it was shifting to what it called a “core service offer”, meaning that it would look to deliver only those services it was legally obliged to provide.David Fothergill, Somerset’s Tory leader, blamed the council’s position on a “broken” system of local government funding. The council had made £130m of savings over the past eight years. English councils have experienced government grant funding cut by around half since 2010.Earlier this year, Northamptonshire county council announced it was technically insolvent after failing to balance its books. It has warned that it will move to a “core offer” when it unveils a cuts package later this month to fill a £60m gap in its finances.The LGC data, which covers 2010-11 to 2017-18, came from Freedom of Information requests.

An immediate cash injection for each side of £17m was the lure but a halving of income from central funds made the longer-term prospect look risky.Ceding control would have brought World Rugby’s regulation 14 into play. It is concerned with ownership of clubs and gives effect to “the underlying intention that no entity or group of entities, acting alone or in concert, shall control, or be in a position to control, either directly or indirectly, more than one club”.Darren Bailey is part of the sports law team at Charles Russell Speechlys, a co-founder of Sport360 consulting and a former director of football governance and regulation at the Football Association. In 2000, he became the first legal director of the then International Rugby Board, having rewritten the sport’s regulatory code after it embraced professionalism in 1995, and he was in position for nine years.“The regulations are designed to show there is control from the unions throughout the world and that nothing can take place in one territory that will cause difficulties in another,” he says. “I am sure that the clubs are mindful of regulation 14 and rugby union is a more regulated structure than private companies are used to. They would need to understand the framework they are operating in with a global sport demanding levels of consistency. Any breach of the regulation would leave them needing the consent of the RFU.”Bailey, who was involved in the game when the European Cup grew quickly into a successful competition, believes the interest shown in the Premiership gives club rugby the opportunity to press the reset button. “To be successful, the English clubs, and the French, may have to adopt a more Americanised approach and become less European,” he says. “It would mean, for example, an end to relegation. Clubs need to turn themselves into global brands which means selling themselves and taking more risks to make rugby entertaining. They need to look beyond broadcasters, sponsors and the distribution they receive from the international game. They have the opportunity to think beyond the short term and act collectively both for their inidual benefit and the wider one of the game itself.“The financial driver in rugby is the international game, but the economic imbalance between the hemispheres is one of the biggest challenges rugby is facing. In the past, playing for your country had sufficient pull but these are worrying times for Australia and South Africa. They cannot raise enough revenue in the south where they are playing too much rugby of the same calibre. They will look at the potential growth in the Premiership with anguish at a time when they are suffering but still producing many of the best players.”The former England second-row Ben Kay has called for the RFU to take over the Premiership, doing what they failed to do back in 1995 when the vacuum the governing body’s indecision created was filled by wealthy backers who largely had little previous involvement in the sport. “What is the long-term sustainability of the international game?” asks Bailey. “You only have to look at the impact of overseas players in the Top 14 had on the national side in France.“An RFU takeover would allow it to harmonise refereeing, so that the breakdown was no longer a surprise for English players in the Test arena, and they could play with the intensity Eddie Jones wants. Rugby has to evolve in a complementary way rather than explosions taking place in one part of the game or structure.“It is an intriguing time for club rugby and its relationship with the international game. The relationship between the economic powerhouses, England and France, and the rest of the game is full of tension. There needs to be a proper conversation because if the Premiership clubs continue to make losses, they could be reduced to three or four superclubs.”If CVC’s bid failed to attract the unanimous support of the 13 Premiership shareholders, its interest has opened a door. “It is a good time for outside investors to be coming into the sport,” says Bailey. “It depends what their long-term plan is. The owners would be concerned that they would not be involved for enough time to fully pay them and they won’t want to lose their autonomy, not least because they know the game.“The interest should be welcomed, providing the model is right and complementary. The grassroots have to be looked after with an allocation of profits, but I do not think this could be done on a purely domestic setting. It has to be global and remain within the parameters of World Rugby’s regulatory code. What CVC did brilliantly in Formula One was exploit a global framework. In rugby, that would mean a significant marketing of the Premiership, more iconic grounds and bigger crowds. Big companies do not come in unless they feel there is money to be made and it should give the game confidence. You could get a World Rugby Inc in the future, but who would control it?”• This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

And she credits a happy home life for her successSix years into her WNBA career, Elena Delle Donne appears to be at peace. Things that may have bothered her in the past, no longer weigh so heavily. As a result, she is playing some of the best basketball of her life. The guard-forward is averaging 20.4 points per game, and reached 3,000 career points this season, becoming the fastest player to do so in WNBA history. The 2015 MVP also played in her fifth All-Star game, this time as captain. And that’s before you consider the fact that she helped lead her team, the Washington Mystics, to the brink of a championship before coming up short in the WNBA finals against the Seattle Storm.“This has been a great year for me, there’s no denying that,” Delle Donne tells the .For all her success on the court, it’s more personal matters that Delle Donne believes have helped her game, from finding an agent that “gets” her, to settling in with the Mystics, and marrying her wife, Amanda.So when she sustained a knee injury in Game 2 of the WNBA semi-finals against the Atlanta Dream last month, Delle Donne dug deep and powered her way through Games 4 and 5, helping the Mystics reach the finals. As one media outlet wrote, “Elena Delle Donne balled out on one leg.”Delle Donne’s WNBA journey started with the Chicago Sky, but she felt unsettled, and failed to find the necessary team dynamics to get to the next level. So when the offer to play with the Mystics surfaced, it made sense to create a home for herself in DC. She would get a fresh start and be only a couple of hours away from her family in Wilmington, Delaware.“I have a comfort here in DC. I think it comes with being older than when I was in Chicago, but I also having incredible teammates,” says the 29-year-old. “I feel like we’ve kind of built a family culture on the scene, which has been huge for our team success, and to my success as well.”Fans have also noticed something else about about Delle Donne outside of her dominance on the court. The laser-focused player, who takes charge as a leader on her team, isn’t as serious off the court.“She’s actually really goofy and fun,” her wife, Amanda Delle Donne, says.Being open to the outside world isn’t exactly second nature to Delle Donne. She’s always been protective of her private life. The barrier that Delle Donne built resulted in fans not being able to connect with her on a more personal level. Amanda felt it was important for the public to see the multi-faceted person that she has grown to love. “When I first met Elena in Chicago, I thought she was going to be really serious, just from what I knew about her as a basketball player,” Amanda says.After spending time with her though, she quickly realized that Delle Donne was different off-court. “The more I got to know her, the weirder she got. But, weird in a good way!” Amanda says with a laugh. So that fans might see this side of her wife, Amanda starting sharing bits of their life together on social media – their dog attempting to give Delle Donne a new hairstyle one of America’s best athletes tackling a spider invasion and some pretty impressive amateur magic skills.“We get a ton of comments and private messages, and we can’t read them all, but the support has been great. People appreciate the glimpses they’ve gotten to see of her away from basketball and we have noticed a difference in who is following her as well,” Amanda says.Revealing herself like this wasn’t easy, according to Delle Donne. “I wasn’t hesitant at first of my life being on social media because I feel like my whole life has been under a microscope,” Delle Donne says. “But I’m glad she’s taken that initiative, and it took Amanda to help me open up and realize to just be yourself. Who the hell cares?”She has also served as a judge during this year’s Washington Capital Pride parade, something she may not have done before. But things are different now she says: “Amanda certainly has helped me realize that I can make a difference, and I also live in a city that is really political where it makes it hard to ignore what’s happening,” says the Olympic gold medallist.It’s easy to see that Delle Donne’s comfort off the court has helped her game. But now, what she can do with her elevated platform as a star basketball player means so much more to her.“I’m going to speak my truth and hopefully leave this game better than when I came in. That is far bigger than any championship I could ever win.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca1a38401599446cf9322b4a844960b3306d824d/432_601_4615_2769/master/4615.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82e0d047c56ae72334fd9c1f608e5d9e","title":"guardian cricket writers pick greatest england cricketers all time","story":"Alastair Cook hailed Jimmy Anderson the ‘best cricketer England have ever produced’. Our correspondents beg to differYoung, svelte, pre-injury Botham was great on the numbers alone. In his first 50 Tests Botham scored 2,500 runs at 35 and took 230 wickets at 22, a swing bowler in the Anderson class. For the last eight years of the Botham Supremacy he was something else, toting around his own outlandish celebrity, still conjuring moments of paunchy brilliance, but never looked after in the manner of the current crop. The greatest and, oddly enough, still the most famous modern English cricketer. BRNo batsman in history has scored more than his 61,760 first-class runs, nor can match the 197 first-class centuries he compiled between 1905 and 1934. And had Archduke Franz Ferdinand not been assassinated in Sarajevo in 1914 – the spark from which four years of bloody conflict raged across Europe, thereby pausing the sport – the first cricketer to be nicknamed “the Master” (and the first professional to be knighted) would probably have finished with a few more. AMFor her fizz, her gumption and her refusal to take no for an answer. For her fundraising, her promotion, her organisation of the first World Cup. For the first six in a women’s Test, her six unbeaten series in charge of England, her match-saving 179 against Australia. For her grin, and for hauling women’s cricket out of its obsession with skirt length and the right sort and into the modern era. TARank Grace against his contemporaries and in his best decade he scored almost one out of every three centuries made in first-class cricket. Rank him against everyone else, and he’s still in the all-time top 10 lists for both batting and bowling in first-class cricket. But really, his impact is better expressed in words than numbers. In 50 years of cricket, Grace didn’t just “found the theory of modern batting” as Ranji put it, but turned cricket from “a county pursuit pastime into a national institution”. ABIn later life, in the commentary box, he was a bit of a bore. But on the field he was the finest bloody fast bowler England ever produced. He had pace, swing, heart, an average of 21 and a strike rate of 49. He took 307 wickets, then a world record, in 67 Tests, which is about 60 more than Jimmy Anderson took in his first 67, and at an average of 21 rather than 30. And Fred didn’t have DRS on his side. TdLOf the current batch I would put Jimmy Anderson just ahead of Alastair Cook in this category and I have great admiration for both. I’ve bypassed Botham, Gower, Trueman, Hutton, Compton, Hammond, Hobbs , Rhodes and the statistically awesome Barnes and will settle for Grace, who more or less created the modern game as well as taking all those wickets and scoring all those runs. VMWhile longevity brings admiration and sometimes love, peak performances inspire awe. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Botham was the world’s leading miracle worker. His comical, unprecedented self-belief was combined with exquisite skill: as a swing-bowling artist, a genius in the slips and either a classical hitter or a beery slogger. He could also drink till dawn and still be ready to walk on water from 11am. English sport has never produced a superhero like him. RSHammond had the lot: one of England’s greatest slip fielders, one of the country’s finest batsmen and a more than decent fast‑medium bowler, he averaged 58.45 across 85 Tests (only two men have scored more than his 167 first‑class centuries, and there were 36 double-centuries to boot), took 110 catches – putting him fifth among non-wicketkeepers, in considerably fewer matches than his rivals – and snared 83 wickets at a handy average of 37.40. SBThe weight of statistics alone would provide a compelling argument for Hutton his 364 against Australia in 1938 remains England men’s highest Test score. However, it was the environment in which he achieved a career average of over 55 that elevates these achievements: the first professional to captain England, a world war intervening at the prime of his career and all done on uncovered pitches throughout. As batter, captain and pioneer, Hutton is peerless.

Seven home-grown products were part of the side which clinched a ninth successive Championship victory for the visitors, while another – Sam Curran – was voted England’s man of the series in the Test triumph over India.The last time Surrey put together such a sequence of victories in first class cricket was in 1999, when on the way to the first of three titles in four years under Adam Hollioake. The Championship pennant has eluded Surrey since 2002 when one of the current side - Rikki Clarke - was part of the squad.But the depth of locally produced talent - plus key overseas signings like Morne Morkel - suggest they could now go on and enjoy a similar run of success as achieved under Hollioake.Worcestershire, who themselves fielded nine home grown players, were the last side to deny Surrey victory in south London in early May and they again fought hard in the return encounter. But Morkel’s devastating five-wicket burst on Wednesday evening proved crucial in ensuring Surrey had to tackle a less demanding target than had looked likely for most of the third day.It means they now face an uphill task to avoid an instant return to Division Two and will have to beat Essex at Chelmsford and visiting Yorkshire to have any hopes of survival.Surrey resumed on 70 without loss and Stoneman and Burns looked relatively untroubled and a back foot cover drive for his 10th four by the former at Wayne Parnell’s expense took him to a 69-ball half-century - and also raised the century stand.Burns followed his partner to 50 in the same over - from 90 deliveries and with the aid of eight fours.It was Parnell who finally broke the partnership on 111 when he bowled Stoneman for 59. Dillon Pennington bowled a probing spell and was rewarded when first innings century-maker Burns was bowled off his pads for 66.Burns has had a memorable first year as club captain with four hundreds and six half-centuries and looks good for a place in England’s squad for the forthcoming tour of Sri Lanka.Another of Worcestershire’s promising crop of young pace bowlers, Josh Tongue, then accounted for Elgar – also bowled – for 21.Pope and Ben Foakes, able to bat in his accustomed position after illness meant he dropped down the order in the first innings, saw Surrey to lunch with no further alarms. Only 62 were needed when Foakes (22) went for a top-edged pull against Parnell and fell to a fine catch by Ross Whiteley, running back from square leg.Worcestershire continued to plug away and Will Jacks (12) holed out to extra cover off Ed Barnard. Pope (49) was comprehensively bowled by Pennington and the same bowler dismissed Tom Curran (seven) as he gloved to Whiteley, running back from slip. But the 36-year-old Clarke kept his nerve to see Surrey over the finishing line and there were wild scenes of celebration when Morkel turned Pennington for the winning boundary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaf92face9ef2b0159998001fb456088cbd0f3cd/0_983_4478_2688/master/4478.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2da1845609370198b358c38c5f2ab9cd","title":"is there a cheap windows alternative macbook user apple","story":"Bernadette is a writer, photographer who can’t afford a new Apple laptop. Is there a lightweight and affordable replacement out there?I need a new lightweight laptop, as I travel a bit, but cannot afford a Mac at this time. I already own an iPad (and an iPhone) but the screen is too small for hosting group meetings. Also, I am a writer and photographer. What would be your suggestion for a lightweight, value-for-money laptop that won’t take me too far from the facilities of an Apple product that I’ve been accustomed to using for many years. BernadetteIf you’re a happy long-term Mac user then I recommend you stick with Apple. There’s not a huge amount of difference between MacOS and Windows 10, but you will have built up years of experience and “motor memory” reactions that you will lose if you change operating systems. Also, while Windows 10 does a reasonable job of working with smartphones, you will lose the integration that Apple provides between iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and iCloud.And while MacBooks still cost more than mainstream Windows laptops, the saving may not be compelling if you view it over the life of the machine.For example, let’s imagine that you would be happy to pay an extra 50p per day for the pleasure of staying with Apple. If you amortise your laptop purchase over three years, you could afford to pay a premium of £390 to buy a MacBook Pro (assuming a five-day working week). If you reckon you could make it last five years, you could justify a premium of £650. Of course, this argument is moot if you don’t have the cash.The obvious alternative is a refurbished or secondhand MacBook Pro, either from Apple or a third-party supplier. The drawback is that only old Macs are cheap. A MacBook Pro from, say, late 2016 could still cost around £1,000, and you could buy a new 13in MacBook Air for that.With Windows 10, the advantages include touch screens, the ability to run tablet apps, pen operation, logging in with face recognition using Windows Hello, and the “tent mode” you get with laptops that have 360-degree hinges.Not all Windows laptops have all of these features – they add to the cost – so it would be useful if you could try them in advance to see which ones would work for you.Of course, the iPad Pro offers some of them. However, a Windows 10 machine like a Microsoft Surface Pro offers all but one (tent mode) as well as the power of a MacBook in a single device.A Surface Pro – alternatives are available from other suppliers – should also work well for a writer and photographer. You can run full Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with a mouse or touchpad, do editing and annotation with a pen, then use it like a tablet for viewing or showing images. You can also handwrite notes in OneNote.Some iPad apps are becoming available in MacOS, but Apple is still in denial about touch screens. I’ve been using them for six years now, and when I use a laptop that doesn’t have touch, it feels backward and broken.Mac-like laptopsAsus stands out as the Windows PC manufacture with the most Mac-like products. Its manufacturing arm, Pegatron, has been a contract manufacturer for Apple and Microsoft so it knows the business. (Both company names are derived from Pegasus, the flying horse.) Asus Zenbooks tend to be better made and have screens with better colour gamuts than many alternatives, but may cost more as well.The obvious laptop for your purposes is the 14in non-touch Asus UX410UA-GV544T, which is “crafted from solid aluminium” (but not a unibody design) and available in Quartz Grey or Rose Gold. The current version has a 2.2GHz Intel Core i3-8130U with 4GB of memory and a 256GB SSD. The screen resolution is 1920 x 1080 pixels (Full HD). The price from Asus is £643.89 (or 12 monthly payments of £56.96), which is around half the price of a 13in MacBook Pro with a seventh-generation Core i5 and 8GB.The Asus UX410UA is the same as the Asus UX3410UA, while the Asus UX410UQ models have Nvidia 940MX graphics chips. The UX430UA models are newer, slightly thinner and a little more expensive. The UX490UA is the deluxe version. Any of these would do the job.The main drawback is the 4GB of memory, but the Argos Q\u0026ampA says that you can upgrade it, and this has generally been the case with UX410UA designs. However, there is only one memory slot, so you’d have to ditch the 4GB installed to fit 8GB or 16GB.I’m less concerned about the 128GB SSD because you can slot in a cheap 64GB or larger SD card to store photos and presentations.Second hand?The best alternatives to MacBook Pros – Dell’s XPS 13 and 15, Microsoft’s Surface Pro and Surface Book, Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Carbon etc – are obviously out of your price range. However, have a look at the Tier1Online and Morgan websites for deals on refurbished ThinkPad X series Ultrabooks. Prices vary according to age and condition. I didn’t see anything I’d recommend at the time of writing, but you might get lucky. A Surface Pro 3 or 4 would also be a good option, but certified refurbished models can be quite hard to find. You could try eBay, but battery life isn’t guaranteed, and changing Surface Pro batteries is not a simple task.Have you got a question?

But what’s the biggest takeaway from thousands of hours spent watching telly?“I could be wrong – and being new to this game I probably am – but there appears to be some quite good television around at the moment,” began the  TV review of 2 February 2004. The writer went on to mention a few programmes, some of which still seem quite good, others perhaps less so. Shameless, The Alan Clark Diaries, Little Britain, Six Feet Under, I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here! (Hey, it was still relatively new it was the series with Katie Price and Peter Andre. And OK, maybe the writer – I – was wrong.) The review itself was about a programme in which Alistair McGowan went wild with rhinos and a South Bank Show about television, both forgettable.That was my first review (apart from a brief stint a few years before, but let’s not complicate this). Since then I have written about bonnets and ballroom dancing, Big Brother, baking and a whole bunch of stuff that doesn’t start with B. Drama, documentaries, comedies, soaps, gameshows, Nordic noir, Black Mirror, Red Riding, Green Wing, Blue Planet. I have written about people who marry horses, and eat their lovers, and about Rolf Harris painting the Queen. I have covered the coverage of elections and World Cups, the Olympics and presidential inaugurations, and I have reviewed other people reviewing TV.Fourteen and a half years, it’s been, and because of the extremely high-pressured nature of the work, reviewing years are like dog years – worth seven. So that’s a century, in which I have produced about 2,500 reviews, getting on for 2m words, seen five incarnations of the Doctor (if you count Jodie Whittaker’s tantalising appearance at the end of the last Christmas special), and 13 seasons of The Apprentice …The Apprentice, maybe more than anything else, drives home that I have been doing this long enough too long, some might say. I have written 20 – twenty – reviews of The Apprentice, and that’s not including The Young Apprentice, plus interviews with winners, with Lord Sugar and with Sugar’s sidekicks. I have nothing left of any interest to say about The Apprentice. They are all tossers – I have said so too many times. It’s not just the show that is tired – I am, too. When the new series begins next month, it’s very important that someone else should cover it. Sam: you’re fired.But first, a few things I have learned during my innings.… and the solar system, from a man named Brian, who knows some very big numbers and can often be found sitting on top of mountains, staring into eternity. I have learned about the world from David – Sir David, though it should really be King David – and that it is under threat, and that racer snakes will give you nightmares. I have learned about the power of nightmares, and world politics and how we got to where we are now (or at least where we were then) from a man named Adam with a very big record collection. From Charlie, I’ve learned that the near future is a nightmare. From Mary, I have learned how to make a heavenly Victoria sponge and that baking is bigger than everything, even the BBC. From Danny I have learned that genealogy – even someone else’s – can be entertaining. And recently, from Danny’s daughter Dani, I have learned that, even in the current climate, geniality can prevail.If that original February 2004 list underwhelmed, how about this little lot that has dropped since, on my watch? Nighty Night, The Thick of It, Sherlock, Skins, Bodies, Green Wing, Breaking Bad, The Inbetweeners, Mad Men, Broadchurch, Pulling, Extras, Him and Her, Appropriate Adult, Black Mirror, Nathan Barley, Extras, The Trip, Happy Valley, The Killing, Borgen, The Bridge, Homeland, Top of the Lake, Toast of London, Gogglebox, Better Call Saul, Girls, The Staircase, True Detective, Transparent, The Night Manager, Camping, Big Little Lies, Educating Essex and Yorkshire (Oh, God, remember Musharaf and Mr Burton? I’m welling up all over again). Plus Planet Earth 2, Blue Planet 2, Line of Duty, The Crown, Wolf Hall, The Handmaid’s Tale, Wild Wild Country, A Very English Scandal, Patrick Melrose …Obviously I have missed out loads of programmes in this list, for which I will quite rightly get crucified – one-offs and mini-series, and whole genres, such as news coverage, sport, reality and scripted reality. And there are shows that began before I did but I still got to get involved with – The Wire, Peep Show, Family Guy, South Park, Michael Apted’s Up Series (possibly the greatest documentaries of all). And personal favourites, such as Pimp My Ride, The Armstrongs (owners of Coventry’s third-largest double-glazing company, remember?), and Brat Camp, which made me proud of badly behaved British teens. These might not make any greatest-of-all lists but have a special place in my heart. Overall, what a time to have been watching the telly.What, I have to do my best of the best, even though that is impossible? OK, then, quickly …Drama: Breaking Bad, because The Wire was already up and running.Adaptation: The Handmaid’s Tale (just, over Patrick Melrose, because of the nerve it hit).Documentary strand: The Up series, even though it was already up and running.Comedy: The Thick of It.Little things have changed. Fashions, popular subjects: sharks, Tourette’s, posh people, poor people, beautiful bodies, embarrassing ones, naked people, clothing people, mad people, bad people, bad kids, posh kids, ladettes to ladies, Gypsies, baking, more bloody baking, sharks again, celebrity sharks.But really big things have changed, too, such as The Way We Watch Television. You know how it goes: the idea that you sit down to something when someone else decides that you should is a ridiculous, old-fashioned notion and only my mum sees TV in its scheduled slot. There was once just the one screen and not many channels now there are multiple screens and the sheer volume of stuff is terrifying. You are watching University Challenge from the Monday before last the kids are in their rooms watching … well, who knows what? The role of television in family life, even in national life, has changed. It is no longer a blanket to snuggle up under together.Netflix has changed everything, too, churning out highly polished drama and documentaries at a rate that is terrifying to conventional channels. And – like other streaming services – it isn’t constrained by such quaint old ideas as schedules to fill, advertisers to please and a licence fee to justify.It is not just football that can unite. Look at Bodyguard. More than 10 million have now seen the first episode more tellingly, seven million watched the last one when it went out (still reeling, btw). That is practically Den and Angie territory … Well, maybe not quite: Den and Angie are gone for ever (Den really has: RIP Leslie Grantham).Strictly, too. And Bake Off, both are best served straight from the oven. The crowning of Queen Nadiya will surely one day be seen as a key moment in 21st-century British social history. Twitter has played its part in this. #VeryBigCyberSofa #NewBlanketIn the paragraph about bloody brilliant shows above, a lot are quite recent, and that is not just down to my memory issues. This absolutely is a 24-carat golden age, particularly for drama, but also for documentaries, comedy, everything. To the nostalgic, rose-tinted specs-wearers, I challenge you to watch The Jewel in the Crown or Brideshead Revisited next to Patrick Melrose or A Very English Scandal and tell me TV was better then. Look at the actors and the writers that TV attracts: Hugh Grant and David Nicholls. The big-screen movie stars queueing up to get on to the big little screen. Look at the brilliant new talents coming out of television, such as Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the creator of Crashing and Fleabag, Michaela Coel, who brought us Chewing Gum, and Will Sharpe, who wrote Flowers.And look at all the money. Netflix can spend £5-£10m on an hour of drama that is only watched by a handful – though who knows how many? – of people in any one country. That may be sending waves of fear through the industry, but to us on the sofa, well, there is no need to get off, ever.If I were starting now, my list of quite good telly around at the moment would be easy. Jed Mercurio’s Bodyguard and Hugo Blick’s Black Earth Rising (starring Coel). I’m excited about the new one from Waller-Bridge, Killing Eve, which starts on Saturday, and Channel 4’s new reality show The Circle, and more Gogglebox. Oh, go on then, the bloody Bake Off, too.Ah, poor me, all alone on the sofa at home, or in a disgusting, smelly (my fault, to be fair) little windowless box in the office, watching telly. Not always alone, though. Look at the comments below the line sometimes just a few, sometimes hundreds. This sofa is an infinitely extendable one. Everyone is invited, not just friends, and not everyone is friendly.“Is this the worst Sam Wollaston ‘review’ ever?” (To be fair to me, I don’t think that one was the worst.) “How can he be paid for writing this drivel?” (Usual way, into my account, monthly.) A well-known writer of television comedy once appealed to his hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers to encourage me to quit.People have been kind, too. I have, here on my desk, a box full of letters – actual letters that came in the post, so obviously all from people who are even older than me – but almost all lovely. Thank you.I once found myself, in the pub, sitting opposite someone I had recently described in print as a twat. He didn’t seem to have read it, though, or to have heard of me. I never had to review a drama by my boss, as Nancy Banks-Smith did, brilliantly and mercilessly. I did once find myself writing about the person sitting opposite me in the office. He bought me tea from the trolley I was kind about his programme. Call it a bung, if you like.I said that the 2006 BBC series Robin Hood was good it turned out not to be. Apologies. And I think that’s about it, for getting things wrong. Once, for a review of a Money Programme called The Sicknote Scandal, about people taking the day off work for no reason at all, I didn’t write anything, just left the slot blank. It was supposed to be a joke but not everyone thought it was funny. My dad was furious. There’s no point linking to it it really doesn’t work at all online.I may have been over-harsh on Downton Abbey, for being a soap (what’s wrong with soaps?). On Call the Midwife, for being sanctimonious and dull (although it is sanctimonious and dull). On Top Gear for being Top Gear (what happened to that lot, I wonder?). And Game of Thrones has never been my thing, for which I don’t apologise.For me, I mean, if not for you. Watching television, for work, for the . I am not leaving the paper: I’m going to be writing about other things, getting off the sofa, out of my smelly little room, maybe even talking to people. I am leaving the best job in the world, though. Now it’s someone else’s turn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1781fee84dad977ae5f8a6e418992eac064f22d/0_39_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e0e194a27baff7ab3ef74d413d92e0d","title":"florence hurricane north carolina residents preparations latest","story":"With Florence looming in the Atlantic, the city’s residents are defiant, stubborn, and asking for ine intervention to get through yet another Carolina hurricaneAfter an hour-long wait outside on a balmy end-of-summer morning, Christian Endreson, 68, picked up the three pieces of plywood he needed to board up his daughter’s home and got in line to pay.He was not alone. Nearly a hundred people joined him in line for last minute supplies of plywood at The Home Depot in Wilmington, North Carolina, early Wednesday as Hurricane Florence barreled towards the Carolina coast.The storm weakened to a category 3 hurricane on Wednesday and forecasters expect it to weaken further as it nears the shore,\u0026nbsp but Florence was still forecast to be “an extremely dangerous major hurricane when it nears the US”.The system was expected to make landfall early Saturday – a predicted timing that keeps moving back incrementally as the storm chugs slowly across ocean waters.Having survived Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey in 2012, Endreson is refusing to leave his family’s home now.His five daughters are spread out over the country, nearly all of them having survived the likes of Hurricane Harvey in Galveston, Hurricane Irma in Fort Lauderdale last year and Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey, Endreson summarizes.As Endreson lined up to pay, a Home Depot associate came over the speaker and asked customers to remain calm, not be rude to employees, and not to panic before the store closes late morning. There is plenty of plywood in today, she added, before signing off.Walmart employee Joseph Smith, 52, said the store went through 60 pallets of water in 30 minutes as residents rushed in for supplies.“Canned meat, water, and batteries are what people are looking for right now,” Smith said, noting he has had to restock those the most since the start of the week. There’s plenty of bread still, he adds. He’s working the last shift before the store closes in the afternoon. “I don’t pay any attention to the hurricanes,” he added as he unloaded fish sticks into the freezer bin, “I’ve always had to work”.Meanwhile, down at the nearby coast, Matthew Parr, 34, finished his last surf on Wrightsville Beach.He’s lived in Wilmington his whole life and is going to hunker down inland at his house.“North Carolina gets hit a lot,” he said as he loaded his surfboard onto the back of his red pickup truck.Parr estimated he has lived through five hurricanes in this small beach town. Pointing to a friend in the passenger seat of his vehicle, Parr said he is a property insurance agent who believes he has probably gotten a couple of hundred calls in the last two days as homeowners in the region imagine the potential damage Florence can wreak on their homes and businesses.Across the street, the Redix clothing store is boarded up with the names of past hurricanes: Bertha, Fran, Matthew and Irene daubed on the wood. “Go home, Flo” a black spray painted sign says on a vacation rental office’s boarded up door down the street.A mailman drove by, delivering mail to now shuttered homes.Wrightsville Beach, unlike the town of Wilmington, is under the mandatory evacuation order.Police are allowing residents on and off the beach until Wednesday evening to secure their homes and remove belongings before the mandatory comes into effect curfew tonight.Stevie Cline, 25, stood on a patio overlooking the half-empty marina, while waiting for her brother-in-law, who plans to stay put, hoping to re-open his business soon after the storm. Cline beckoned an approaching boat to fill up on gas, sympathizing with its owner’s quest for fuel.“I had to go to five different gas stations the other day,” she recalled, but was quick to point out neighbors have been supportive. The owner of the boat dock she’s standing over let her fill up on boat gas, as she calls it, but he did charge her double, she said.With Florence looming, the city’s residents are defiant, stubborn, and asking for ine intervention to get through yet another Carolina hurricane.Because of her 10-year-old son and a six-week-old pitbull she’s fostering, Jackie Sage, 40, didn’t want to be stuck in the car so she hopes her house will hold up. Florence is the first major hurricane she and her family will weather, having moved to a house on the beach two years ago from Cincinnati.“Power to the prayer,” she says flashing a smile and a thumbs up after loading up her generator and putting gasoline in the car before driving back to her beach home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a6704295405f527eaad16962822867fb2793d53/682_864_7011_4208/master/7011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f79bbd419802bfd7925e7a97bdb53a3","title":"brexit worries from the irish border a panoramic photo essay","story":"Amid the growing tensions over Brexit and the border, photojournalist Charles McQuillan met people whose work takes them across the frontier.

The nothingness of it.”“One of the privileges that comes with being a photographer is that it allows you access to people you would not necessarily meet, and it was difficult not to be moved by Betty, Eamonn, John, Brian, Emma, Johnny, Vincent, William and Catriona as I listened to their concerns about Brexit. Each of the subjects photographed were grateful for being allowed a voice, something many people in the province feel they no longer have.“My own memories of the border and the checkpoints are somewhat distant, but I can recall sitting on the back seat of my mother and father’s car wondering whether the raised hand of the guard would either beckon onwards or to stop. The mundaneness of the various checkpoints across the north, the armed soldier with his weapon trained on the car, all seem to have merged into one memory now. When stopped at the border, the question to my father was always the same: ‘Where are you coming from sir and where are you going?’ I can’t remember my father ever declaring anything.”Catriona attends nearby St Mary’s college in Derry. Her journey to and from school threads through the border.She says: “Ireland’s economy cannot afford to make the border anything more than it already is today – an invisible line that separates the country. At most, we will have checkpoints which will take a great step back into the past of Northern Ireland. My biggest fear is that it will damage my future education through travelling to university, affecting my pathway of study.”Farmer and landowner, Florence CourtThe popular boardwalk on the farmer’s land allows thousands of tourists to walk across the border every year as it meanders between County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland and County Cavan in the Republic of Ireland.A member of the Border Communities Against Brexit group, Sheridan predicts the UK will lose much of its wealth and status after Brexit. He says: “There is no such thing as a soft border. Over time, it will become a hard border by layer upon layer of legislation. The only practical solution I can see is to have the border in the Irish Sea.”Vice-chair of Newry Chamber of Commerce and TradeMarmion, who has two young children, owns a human resources business with offices and employees in Newry in the north and Dundalk in the south. She recalls recently explaining to her eldest child, while they were riding their bikes, that she was unable to use the road they were cycling on when she was young because of concrete blockades placed there by the British army. She says she has no idea what the border will look like after Brexit. “That’s the scary part – nobody knows. My greatest hope is that it would be ision-less and prosperous, not just for business and trade but for the navigation of everyday life.”When asked what concerns her most, Marmion says: “That the border would look like it did when I was growing up: restrictive and fearsome. Absent of both the freedom of movement and unlocked opportunity that my children deserve – and that I have enjoyed since 1998.”McKeegan crosses the border several times a week as he attends to the recently deceased from both sides of the frontier. He says: “If the politicians were children you would give them a smack and tell them to get their heads together to sort it out. There’s no reason in the world that they can’t come to some common-sense agreement. In relation to my sensitive line of work, can you imagine waiting in a queue at the border with family sitting in cars behind you as you carry their loved ones home? It’s undignified. You just can’t close the border off with a brick wall and red tape.”Holmes is a member of Donegal Action for Cancer Care, which is based in the Republic of Ireland but has access to nearby health facilities in the north. Without access to the new radiotherapy unit in Derry, which the Irish government invested in, cancer patients in Donegal face a five-hour journey to Galway.When asked what she thinks the border will look like post-Brexit, Holmes says: “There will be a serious ision of people who have lived and worked closely together for many peaceful years. Long queues, angry people, loss of jobs, missed appointments, flights and a younger generation who can’t understand why. They will now bere introduced to a time when hate and bigotry were rife and the possible return of paramilitaries. My greatest fear after Brexit is the serious loss of access to cancer services for Donegal patients at Altnagelvin Area hospital in Derry. Without these patients, the North West Cancer Centre will not have the critical mass to sustain the services needed for cancer patients in Derry and the surrounding areas.”McKevitt recalls how, in his youth, IRA snipers would shoot at the customs post from the hills, pictured behind him. He was sent by his parents to the US to avoid getting caught up in the violence that engulfed the province. His fireworks, gardening and fuel business sits on the land the former customs post used to occupy.He says he has many concerns about Brexit. “My greatest fear is of the government taking my land away with the return of the customs post. I’ve built up all of this and worked hard, what would I do then?”As a business owner whose oyster farm straddles both sides of the border, Lynch will be particularly affected after Brexit. He faces tariffs to ship his oysters outside of the UK to nearby Donegal, and indeed the rest of the Europe. He says: “I worry that we will return to the bad old days. I remember the border growing up as a child quite vividly, and I remember the two customs posts sat only a few yards apart from each other, and that you couldn’t cross the border after 10pm without special written permission from the guards.” To further complicate matters, the UK government claims jurisdiction over Lough Foyle to the high-tide mark, while the Irish government disputes this.Clifford, who lives in the Republic of Ireland, owns a fast food stand that trades along the border to lorry drivers transporting goods between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.He says: “I don’t know what’s going to happen after Brexit, no one does. My biggest fear is that I will lose my job, my livelihood, everything – and that, at the finish of it, the Troubles will come back.”Kilkeel is home to Northern Ireland’s largest fishing fleet. Cunningham is concerned that could soon change. He says: “My biggest fear is displacement of fishing effort. We traditionally fished in the bay of Dundalk, a few miles along the coast, but we’ll no longer be allowed in there. It’s a disaster for the inshore fishing fleet.“There are 40 small boats in Kilkeel harbour that seek shelter through the winter from the prevailing south-west winds. When Brexit happens, where will they go? Small boats exposed 12 miles out to sea, that’s life or death stuff. That’s not bullshit, that’s reality.”McQuillan says: “The portraits could have been shot digitally and much more simply with a wide-angle lens. However, the perspective would have become warped. Whereas a panoramic camera avoids curvature if positioned correctly, offers less distortion and is much truer to the eye with its even horizon and straight lines. Shooting film again for the first time in almost 20 years would also give the photographs a different look and feel to modern digital cameras, with the colours saturated and borrowed from a different time. However, the film came at a premium, with the size of the panoramic negative only permitting four exposures per roll.“The panoramic cameras, a Fuji GX617 and a Noblex u150, brought unique challenges. Focus could only be accurately accomplished with the aid of a tape measure. Flash could not be synced to the Noblex because of its rotating drum lens. To further complicate matters, fingers placed incorrectly when holding the camera would fall into frame if not careful. This was something that only became apparent when I was confronted with the negatives in the darkroom, which I built in a corner of the garage to iron out the camera’s idiosyncrasies and quirks. The only downside to shooting on panoramic format was having to go back to what once seemed a full-frame digital camera. I found that the view was much more restricted than had appeared before.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c95c3bdff1401558903334495e41ec6d9a4f4365/0_114_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a91b070152f987267ea9f2a1ef5b7491","title":"north carolina rices creek hurricane florence","story":"Residents of Rice’s Creek – population just 27 – face a potentially life-and-death decision to evacuate or stay in their homes in rural North CarolinaOn a map, the tiny “town” of Rice’s Creek, half a dozen trailer homes named after the body of water they sit by, doesn’t exist. If Hurricane Florence inflicts the damage it is expected to through its storm surge and flash flooding, it may also cease to exist in a real-world sense too.With a population of just 27, the tight-knit North Carolina community started off the week united, promising to weather the storm together on low-lying ground by the creek. By Wednesday afternoon, though, John Silvy’s daughter called him from Athens, Georgia, demanding he come down and bring her two young brothers to secure ground.“If it was just me ’cause I got good friends here, I would stay. I wouldn’t be worried about it. We look out for each other. The kids are my bigger concern,” the 50-year-old father of seven said as he walked over to his neighbors’ house for an impromptu visit in the front yard.Rice’s Creek is technically in Winnabow (population 6,000) in Brunswick county, which is under a mandatory evacuation and a state of emergency. People in mobile homes have also been asked to evacuate. But for these friends and neighbors, that’s a double evacuation order most are not heeding.That might be a life and death decision.The creek, where Silvy’s kids swim, was already higher than usual and overflowing its banks. The low-lying area – a resident estimated it to be a couple of feet above sea level – could make the hurricane a significant threat to those who choose to stay. Unlike the much wealthier, more established neighborhoods on nearby Wrightsville Beach, there’s no police checkpoint in Rice’s Creek to make sure people follow curfews and evacuation orders.Disappointed his neighbor is leaving, Alex Tatum, Silvy’s neighbor on one side, nursed a Yuengling beer, and walked over to his neighbor to justify his staying. A resident of the self-proclaimed town for more than six years, the commercial fish business owner has covered the windows on his wooden double wide trailer home with plywood and intends to stay.“All we got is our work and money. And our house,” he said to his girlfriend of one year, Mandy Dreeland, trying to convince her that staying was the best option.She wasn’t buying it. “Even if the storm shifts, we’re not escaping it,” she responded from a chair on the porch, continuing, “When it rains, the water comes up to the mailbox.”Dreeland cut him off. “And he wants to stay.”The two continued for a few minutes, mentioning snakes and the baby alligator spotted in the green-watered creek the other day.Planning to live days, if not weeks, without electricity, 26-year-old Tatum and Dreeland, 27, spent $600 on batteries, tortilla chips, Pringles, potato rolls, flashlights, tuna, chicken and rice soup, Gatorade and beer to survive in potential darkness after Hurricane Florence’s looming wrath. Their dog, Bella, is prepared with her own set of supplies. But what Tatum, 26, hesitated to buy last week may force them to flee at the last minute.Across from Tatum and Dreeland’s four-bedroom, right next to Silvy’s white wooden home, Raymond Hill’s home sits under a canopy of pine trees. He has already sent his wife to his daughter’s home five miles away on potentially drier ground.Hill won’t be joining her. “It’s mine,” he laughed, leaning on the patio with his bottle of 7 Up, pointing towards his home from his porch, ”and I paid for it.” More importantly, he added, “We keep a small dog and our dog is like our own young’un.”Shelters are out of the question. Hill, shaking his head, ticked off a list: “I don’t need a generator, I don’t need gas, I’ve got lanterns, I’ve got everything I need. And my wife made sure I had canned food and food in the freezer.”The curly white-haired grandfather explained why he should stay by describing a litany of previous waterlogged incidents that left the community in one piece, albeit soggy.Not wanting to be outdone, other neighbors shared their rising water stories. Tim Buck, in a black Harley-Davidson shirt and a bandanna wrapped around his head, unlocked and whipped open a shed to show a line marking how high the water had been on 21 September 1999, just days before Hurricane Floyd.“This high,” hunching down to measure nearly four feet, Buck guessed. Oh, he’s not leaving, he confirms, standing on the boat dock over the water, but he has put two motorcycles on higher ground away from the neighborhood.“I’m staying because I have everything invested in this little place right here. When you get to 60 …” he started to say before cutting himself off. Then, “Hell, I’ve probably nearly drowned twice already. I couldn’t swim a lick.”Buck does have two trucks ready to get him and his wife out if the water rushes up, but that’s too far to think about until it happens, he said. “As long as it don’t take me and my family, I can part with tools and vehicles.”Tatum agreed with his neighbor, except that he has spent $25,000 renovating his hardwood-floor-and-white-cabinets home this year over four months, only to be faced with his home being potentially turned into kindling. That’s why he has to stay, to make sure the house is OK, he repeated, a mantra.Nobody in this row of neighbors has flood insurance, they realized, while standing in Buck’s yard drinking beers. They were silent for a moment before Tatum asked to borrow Buck’s coolers to fill up with ice and hopped back on the golf cart with his stepdad.The final shared words that night among the group were nonchalant but also a warning.Tatum’s stepfather started to drive off, stopped the cart and turned to Buck, “Let me know if you’re staying so I know who to look out for here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/134c57d90a6227a60da6ff01edd0a4132ee1056e/0_108_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f447858a34b84bf621da65f37652c58a","title":"yemen 300000 lives hang in the balance says un","story":"Families ‘absolutely terrified’ as Saudi-led offensive resumes on port city of HodeidaYemen’s humanitarian situation has worsened rapidly since UN peace talks collapsed and fighting resumed in the port city of Hodeida, where hundreds of thousands of lives hang in the balance, the top UN aid official in the country has said.“The situation has deteriorated dramatically in the past few days. Families are absolutely terrified by the bombardment, shelling and airstrikes,” the UN humanitarian coordinator Lise Grande said in a statement.On Thursday, the Saudi-led military coalition attacking Houthi rebels seized the main road into the strategic port city of Hodeida, weakening Houthi control over the supply of humanitarian aid into the country.“The mills in Hodeida feed millions of people,” Grande said. “We’re particularly worried about the Red Sea mill, which currently has 45,000 metric tonnes of food inside, enough to feed 3.5 million people for a month. If the mills are damaged or disrupted, the human cost will be incalculable,” she said.The coalition restarted its offensive on the city at the weekend after UN-sponsored talks in Geneva failed to get off the ground last week. The Houthis claimed they had not been given adequate assurances about their travel to Geneva.It is not clear whether the military coalition, which includes Saudi, Emirati and local Yemeni forces, plans to try to enter the city itself, where more than 300,000 people live.It said more than 15 Houthis were killed in the operation, and its forces would now move to cut off the last road linking Hodeida to Sana’a, the Salih road to the north.The fighting is being led by the Southern al-Amalka 3rd Brigade, commanded by Hamdi Shukri Alsubaihi.The capture of the main road and surrounding area, at a minimum, increases the coalition’s ability to lay siege to the city, but it could also move to capture the port itself, more than 25 miles (40km) to the north of the city, and so avoid the main populated areas.The Saudis argue the port is used by Iranian-backed Houthis as a way of extracting revenue and smuggling arms.On Wednesday, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, brushed aside claims that the Saudi bombing campaign was breaching international humanitarian law, and instead certified arms exports to Saudi could continue.The US state department said the Saudis were taking demonstrable actions to protect civilian lives. Pompeo was forced to make the endorsement after Congress required him by law to examine whether the Saudis were following the rules of war.The state department added: “The Trump administration has been clear that ending the conflict in Yemen is a national security priority. We will continue to work closely with the Saudi-led coalition to ensure Saudi Arabia and the UAE maintain support for UN-led efforts to end the civil war in Yemen, allow unimpeded access for the delivery of commercial and humanitarian support through as many avenues as possible, and undertake actions that mitigate the impact of the conflict on civilians and civilian infrastructure.”The endorsement is likely to be seen as a green light for the Saudi coalition to press ahead with its assault on the Iranian-backed Houthis. Writing for the Washington Post, Yousef al-Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to the US, portrayed the war as a battle to defeat Iran and al-Qaida, adding that Qatar had been backing al-Qaida-linked forces. Qatar had made counter-allegations in the same newspaper.A debate in the UK’s House of Commons on Wednesday revealed Conservative MPs were deeply ided over Saudi tactics, and the damage being inflicted on the reputation of the Gulf States due to the war."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Taoiseach criticises attitudes in the sector and says it contains \u0026lsquoa degree of misogyny\u0026rsquoCrime Victims Helpline published its 2017 annual report on ThursdayYacht being searched by customs and excise officers in KinsaleNotice says if the protesters fail to leave the property, the owner would seek an injunctionFair Deal rates will need to be reviewed if supply is to meet demand, expert saysAn Bord Plean\u0026aacutela initially gave green light for 104 houses and 432 apartmentsProtesters clash with garda\u0026iacute as men in balaclavas eject group from city centre propertyQ\u0026ampA: North Frederick Street housing occupationMillions of people taking statins \u0026lsquodespite unproven benefits and serious side effects\u0026rsquoSystem \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquo due to \u0026lsquodemonstrable\u0026rsquo governance deficit, report saysOverspend on health this year estimated at \u0026euro600m, Paschal Donohoe tells CabinetCPL sent tests to labs in Florida, Nevada and Hawaii, but CervicalCheck did not knowScience Lives: Dr Annie Curtis of the RCSI\u0026rsquos strategic academic recruitment programmeNew study also shows victims have increased levels of trust in police service since 1992Land Development Agency will designate 30 zones in Dublin and 10 in Cork for buildingConfusion over rules of engagement in first election to feature incumbent since 1965Brother owners were not told land bought for over \u0026euro1m was listed for auction"},{"url":null,"title":"housing activists stage sit down on luas tracks in dublin city centre","story":"  September 13, 2018Balaclava-wearing garda\u0026iacute helping remove protesters only inflames an already tense situation   September 13, 2018Notice says if the protesters fail to leave the property, the owner would seek an injunction   September 13, 2018Protesters clash with garda\u0026iacute as men in balaclavas eject group from city centre property "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3627344.1536783491!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new state agency to free up land for 150 000 homes over 20 years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe agency “will demand” that almost a third of homes built on its sites must be affordable houses. Photograph: Alan BetsonAbout 30 zones in Dublin city centre, and 10 in Cork city, are to be designated as special regeneration areas within which State lands will be released for housing, under a new agency to be announced on Thursday.The areas to be identified by the Land Development Agency are a mix of previously announced schemes and new zones. The Government says the agency will pave the way for the construction of 150,000 homes over 20 years.Among the areas in the capital to be designated “regeneration areas” is the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, which is earmarked for the construction of 1,500 homes. In Cork, the regeneration of the docks would provide a further 15,000 homes, it is claimed.It is also understood that areas to the west of Dublin city centre, along the Naas Road, will also be earmarked for development.The new agency, which will have compulsory purchase powers, will build land banks by both releasing State lands for development and acquiring private land holdings nearby.A memo brought to Cabinet on the issue yesterday said it would highlight “key privately held, underutilised lands with strategic development potential, such as those subject to the vacant site levy and the holdings of religious orders”.The agency, to be announced by Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy, will have €1.25 billion in funding and will seek to further assemble land banks into the future to ensure a consistent flow of house building.Initially, some 30 zones in Dublin will be identified for “significant regeneration opportunities”. The Cabinet heard a “consolidated approach provides the opportunity to drive the regeneration of urban quarters in the city”.Among the Dublin city centre zones are Grangegorman Broadstone O’Devaney Gardens St Bricin’s Hospital Infirmary Road holdings by CIÉ, such as the rail works in Inchicore St Teresa’s Gardens Newmarket Square Meath Hospital Dublin Institute of Technology sites Cathal Brugha Barracks Harold’s Cross Greyhound Stadium and Portobello GAA pitch the Irish Glass Bottle site Bridgefoot Street Arbour Hill prison Collins Barracks Boland’s Mills the North Dock of Dublin Port East Wall and St James’s Gate.The sites in Cork city are the Tivoli Docks Páirc Uí Chaoimh the “old Ford site and centre park road” a site formerly used by the National Oil Reserves Agency an ESB site at the Cork marina two holdings around Kent Station Campfield and Marina Park.It is claimed the agency will seek to remove land speculation and drive down the cost of land, which it is hoped will lead to cheaper house prices and increased availability. It will “smooth the peaks and troughs of Ireland’s land and housing market”, the Cabinet was told.The agency will, however, demand that almost a third of homes built on its sites must be affordable houses.The price of an affordable home – or the income of those who would qualify to purchase such a property – is yet to be defined by the Government.Sources pointed to other State housing schemes that roughly allowed a single person on up to €50,000 a year or a couple with a joint income of up to €75,000 a year to qualify for affordable housing."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3620848.1536250034!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish engineer who broke new ground in study of earthquakes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA car under  debris  after an earthquake off the island of Kos, Greece, in July  2017. Photograph: ReutersCostas BaltasGoogle and Harvard University have just announced new research in seismology using artificial intelligence. Researches have “trained” computers using a database of information on earthquakes to help the computers form predictions about future events. The focus of the research is on aftershocks which can cause at least as much damage as the original earthquake. The recent earthquake in Indonesia, for example, demonstrates the potential value of such innovations. The study of earthquakes interested people for centuries, but it was only in the 19th century that an Irish-born engineer applied the term “seismology” to such work. Robert Mallet was born in 1801 in Dublin. His family owned an ironmonger where he worked after completing school and university. The firm produced a wide range of cast-iron parts, including bridge components. Mallet considered himself an engineer and applied for the chair of engineering at Trinity College (which he did not get).Lack of a university appointment did not stop Mallet from conducting scientific work, and he developed a particular interest in the study of earthquakes. His paper to the Royal Irish Academy in 1846 claimed to be “the first attempt to bring the phenomena of the earthquake within the range of exact science”.We now accept that the damage of an earthquake is caused by seismic waves travelling from the site of a fault through the ground. The passage of these waves causes the ground to shake and the shaking ground causes things to move, break, and fall. In the 19th century there was no fully developed explanation, and observations of the aftermath of the earthquake were confusing. Geologists such as Charles Lyell had explained the apparent twisting of objects during an earthquake by reference to vortices. He cited the example of a pair of obelisks in Calabria that had not fallen but instead appeared to have turned on an axis. Mallet proposed a simpler type of motion to account for the same results. He suggested that “rectilinear motion” (rather than any vortices) could account for all the damage seen from earthquakes. He suggested that earthquake was the result of a wave or waves emanating from a geological disturbance and then spreading outwards through the different materials of the earth’s surface. He called these waves “elastic waves of compression”. According to Mallet, what happened to a building experiencing this motion depended on the relationship between its centre of gravity and its “centre of adherence” (essentially how it was anchored to the earth). A high centre of gravity and the building would simply fall over. For those where the centre of gravity was low and aligned with the “centre of adherence” as well as with the direction of the wave, the base and the top would appear to have moved in opposite directions. However, if all three were not aligned the object would appear to have twisted as parts of it moved in multiple different directions.Not content to explain his theory of the motion of an earthquake, Mallet outlined at length a whole programme of the study of earthquakes. He proposed a distribution of earthquake observation centres, testing of the effects of compression waves on a wide variety of substances, mapping the locations of known earthquakes (something he later did himself) and much more. In the same year he delivered a paper on a machine for registering motion of the earth’s surface during even “minute” earthquakes. The machine used the now familiar tracing of a waveform on graph paper although it is not the same as the modern day seismogram. In 1858 he had the opportunity to put his ideas to further use when he was nominated by the Royal Society to travel to Naples and report on the effects of a 1857 earthquake. He used careful observation of fallen and broken walls, collapsed buildings, landslides and reoriented rivers to help him determine the focal point or what we now call the epicentre. He claimed that “every displaced object is in fact a seismometer”, helping him to determine the height and velocity of the compression waves and to pinpoint the central fault that had caused the quake.Mallet’s interest in ballistics also foreshadowed the relationship between war and seismology. Mallet had designed mortars for the Crimean War, and set up experiments to observed the effects of gunpowder explosions. During the Cold War the US department of defence became an important patron of seismology, hoping to use it to detect underground nuclear testing.Dr Juliana Adelman lectures in history at Dublin City University"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

It has\u0026nbspthe biggest price to match, starting at £1,099.To soften the blow, Apple also offered the cheaper iPhone XR. Which also takes the iPhone X\u0027s design, but uses a cheaper material and brings a whole range of colours.That phone costs £749 – much cheaper than any of the other iPhone X-shaped phones.The S moniker was once a staple of Apple\u0027s line-up, used every other year to indicate that the company was sticking with last year\u0027s design but filling it with entirely new innards. It appeared that with the 7 Apple had given up on that naming, but it re-emerges this year.S years have since taken on a reputation for being a year of stability, speed and safety, rather than revolutionary new upgrades. This was one of those years – all of the new iPhones look like last year\u0027s breakthrough iPhone X – with chunky but unspectacular upgrades.Instead, the really radical changes were to the Apple Watch.The wearable received a radical new redesign, for the first time since it was released, which allows the screen to sweep right across the front of the face. It received new features too, including an ECG\u0026nbspmonitor that can keep track of the health of its wearer\u0027s heart.But what is just as notable is what Apple didn\u0027t launch.The company has\u0026nbspbeen rumoured to be preparing new iPads and Macs – neither of which arrived. Those might be getting saved for another event next month, where Apple is expected to show off sweeping new changes to its tablet and computer line.There was also no sign of the AirPower charging mat, which can charge an Apple Watch, iPhone and AirPods all at once.\u0026nbspThat was first shown off at last year\u0027s iPhone event when it was advertised as coming soon – but it was not mentioned at all, and any discussion of it now appears to have been mysteriously pulled from Apple\u0027s website.And plenty more was seemingly killed off: chief\u0026nbspamong them being\u0026nbspthe headphone jack.\u0026nbspApple caused a stir when it announced that the iPhone 7 would come without the plug, but it continued to make it available in its older phones. Now, with the loss of the iPhone SE and 6S from its line-up, all trace of it has been removed – and the new phones don\u0027t even come with the headphone to lightning adapter that was devised to smooth over those complaints.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/09/04/09/istock-471347469.jpg","title":"john lewis waitrose profits brexit retail","story":"Created with Sketch.Full year profits expected to be \u0027substantially lower\u0027, while forecasting is made more difficult due to BrexitClick to followThe IndependentThe retailer said the current \u0027promotional\u0027 market is making trading difficultProfits plunged 99 per cent at the John Lewis Partnership, the owner of Waitrose, in the first half of the year, with the high street giant blaming a “challenging time” in the retail market.

With Theresa May scurrying around the EU trying to deliver Brexit, Greece is\u0026nbspquite right to probe the possibility of bringing the\u0026nbsptreasures homeClick to followThe IndependentThe Elgin Marbles are still one of the most popular displays at the British MuseumIt seems unlikely that several hundred tonnes of marble from Mount Pentelicus near Athens could have a significant role to play in Brexit. But, following a letter from the Greek government to Jeremy Wright,\u0026nbspthe culture secretary, that is exactly what is now happening. Lydia Koniordou, Wright’s Greek counterpart, has asked for dialogue with Britain over the antique sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles.Brought to Britain in the early 1800s by Lord Elgin, the artworks – more properly known as the Parthenon Sculptures – have aroused excitement and controversy ever since. They first went on display in London in 1807, then from 1817 they reached an international audience from a new home in the British Museum. Everyone from Canova to Rodin declared them to be among the most exceptional sculptures ever made. Over two centuries later, they remain one of the British Museum\u0027s most popular displays.Not everyone was happy that Elgin shipped the sculptures to Britain. Lord Byron famously lamented: “Dull is the eye that will not weep to see \u0026nbspThy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed \u0026nbspBy British hands.” But few put his panegyric into context. Byron was a Romantic, who wanted the monumental art of ancient Greek civilisation to crumble poetically as decayed vestiges of lost perfection. He was also making a one-off point rather than speaking from principle, as he personally imported Greek antiquities to Britain and sold them privately.Nevertheless, Byron\u0027s mixed attitudes towards ancient Greece\u0026nbspexpress some of the challenges inherent in questions of cultural heritage, which often see a feverish mix of emotion and romance meet a hard wall of reality.“For me, the Parthenon Sculptures raise some of the biggest questions of cultural property, ownership and where works of art ‘belong’,”\u0026nbspexplains Mary Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge,\u0026nbspThe timing of Greece’s recent letter could not be more significant. Theresa May\u0027s beleaguered strategy to deliver Brexit will ultimately require the consent of all 27\u0026nbspEU members. That means inidual rounds of diplomacy with each country. Greece is taking the opportunity – quite understandably – to probe for a possible quid pro quo, which it hopes will include the Parthenon Sculptures.There have been similar requests from Greece in the past, notably in a campaign by former Greek culture minister Melina Mercouri in the 1980s. However, consecutive British governments have consistently rejected all such requests, although an unexpected door was opened in June when Jeremy Corbyn announced that any government led by him would make it a policy to give the sculptures to Greece.Corbyn\u0027s statement was based on his conviction that the sculptures “belong” to Greece. He referred to them as “stolen” and “looted” by Britain. Many share this view, including members of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, or BCRPM – one of the key groups formed in the UK to press for the sculptures to be given to Greece.The British government\u0027s view goes back to 1816, when a UK Parliamentary Select Committee interviewed witnesses – including Elgin – who had been in Athens at the time, and concluded that Elgin had obtained all necessary permissions from the Ottoman authorities in Athens to remove the sculptures and transport them to England. The Select Committee then voted, 82 to 30, to acquire the sculptures for the nation, before presenting them to the British Museum for public display, scholarship, enlightenment and enjoyment.In many circles, however, there are misgivings about Britain claiming ownership over antiquities that manifestly were not made in Britain. This feeling is tinged with even more awkwardness as the sculptures were acquired during the age of Empire: a period not known for its cultural sensitivity.However, these are generalities. The Parthenon Sculptures have a well-documented and unique history which sheds important light on the controversy.Around 480BC, Athens was entering its Golden Age. It had finally seen off Persia, and the philosophers and playwrights we revere as the founders of western civilisation were starting to tread its sun-hardened streets.Pericles, the city’s leader from around 461BC, decided to mark the city’s new influence and affluence with a vast building project. One of its highlights was to be a magnificent new temple to Athena the Maiden (Parthenos) built on the Acropolis, the city\u0027s highest hill. To ensure the temple was the envy of all, Pericles commissioned one of the city’s sculptors, Pheidias, to decorate the sacred building with a scheme of sculpture that would transport visitors from earth up onto Mount Olympus itself.The artisans in Pheidias’s workshop hacked and smoothed the white marble until eventually the pieces – once vividly painted – were hoisted up onto the great temple. Onlookers were agog, and anyone looking at the sculptures today will know why. The bodies throb with life. The skin appears warm and real to the touch. The gossamer drapery flows as if in natural motion. And the drama of the scenes is charged with an ethereal tension and electricity that is almost unparalleled in art. There are few major sculptors in the last two hundred years who have not looked on them and felt cowed.Once the classical world of mercurial gods and goddesses faded and the era of Christianity dawned, the sculptures began to suffer. Around AD500, the citizens of Athens defaced many and hacked off others in order to convert the Parthenon into a church. This systematic iconoclasm was the single largest act of destruction in the sculptures\u0027 history. Further damage occurred in 1687 when an invading Venetian force bombarded the Acropolis with mortars and scored a direct hit on the Parthenon, which was being used by the ruling Ottomans as an explosives store.The Ottomans – who had conquered Athens in 1456 – are a key player in what was to happen next. In 1799, Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, was appointed Britain’s ambassador to the “Sublime Porte” of the Ottoman Empire at Constantinople. According to some sources, inspired to allow the people and artists of Europe to enjoy the wonders of ancient Greek art, Elgin spent his own money on commissioning artists and sculptors to draw, paint and take casts of the Parthenon Sculptures and other statuary and stonework in Athens.When Elgin\u0027s men arrived in Athens, they found the Ottomans had turned the Acropolis into a military garrison, and soldiers were using the sculptures on the Parthenon for firearms target practice, and hacking bits off to sell to the growing throngs of tourists on the Grand Tour. By this time the Parthenon had only around half of the sculptures that Pheidias originally placed there, with many in poor condition. Mary Beard explains: “The Acropolis was then a rather sordid Turkish military base, and it would have been easy to convince oneself – rightly or wrongly – that the sculpture was better off out of there.”Elgin’s men then began overseeing the removal of the sculptures. Over the course of 10 years, they used local labourers to take down around half of the sculptures on the building (a quarter of the originals), which Elgin shipped back to Britain.Those\u0026nbsp10 years, 1800-10, lie at the heart of the whole Elgin controversy. Opinions ide. Some say Elgin was a hero and conservator who saved the sculptures for the world. Others, like Paul Cartledge, professor of Greek Culture emeritus at Cambridge, differ: “I believe,” he says, “Elgin had purely self-aggrandising reasons for seeking to acquire – for himself and his own personal display – as many of the Marbles as he could.”The 1816 UK Parliamentary select committee concluded otherwise. After examining witnesses and records, it noted that in 1801 Elgin had obtained a firman – an Ottoman legal permit – which, according to a translation shown to them, permitted Elgin to make drawings, create casts and take away “any pieces of stone with inscriptions or figures”.The BCRPM and other reunificationists stress that Parliament did not see the original firman, and so the permit\u0027s specific terms remain unknown. Moreover, they say, even the translated version does not explicitly envisage the wholesale removal of so much sculpture. Elgin was, they say, guilty of mission creep.Whichever view is right, another angle to the question is that Elgin, as ambassador, had the power of the British state behind him. Britain had just defeated Napoleon, who was also an enemy of the Ottomans. Britain was therefore in good odour at the Ottoman court, and Elgin was in a position to ask for favours. “Elgin,” Paul Cartledge believes, “certainly unquestionably exploited the fraught international situation c. 1800, whereby Britain was the enemy of the Ottoman Sultan\u0027s (French) enemy and therefore the Sultan\u0027s ‘friend’.”Those who view Elgin in a more kindly light point to the fact all this removal work was not done covertly or surreptitiously. It was carried out over a period of 10 years, in broad daylight, in central Athens, using hundreds of Greek labourers, under the noses of the authorities, and was even revalidated by a second firman in 1810 when the work was complete and French diplomats tried to hold up the last shipment\u0026nbsp(the French were hoping that they might get some of the sculptures for the Louvre).\u0026nbspThis leads to one of the central disagreements in the whole debate. Greece – aided by allies, including Britain and British philhellenes who had been inspired by seeing the Parthenon Sculptures in London – overthrew the Ottomans in 1832 and restored Greek government. The BCRPM therefore asks how the Ottomans can have given Elgin valid authority to remove the sculptures when they were an illegitimate occupying power.However, the lawyers don’t see it this way. When the Greek government instructed Amal Clooney and Geoffrey Robertson to advise them in 2014, the Syriza government eventually decided that the route to gaining the sculptures was political and diplomatic rather than legal. This came as a surprise to no one. In 1985, Professor John Henry Merryman of Stanford Law School, a leading authority on cultural property, examined the case for restitution and concluded that the modern state of Greece had no legal, moral, or ethical claim to the sculptures.Archaeological treasures of Ancient GreeceThis golden death mask was discovered in the ruins of ancient Mycenae in 1876 by Heinrich Schliemann after he went looking for the palace of Agamemnon, a central figure in the Trojan War.

The figures’ heads are in AthensA wall painting from a house in Akrotiri, Santorini, which was covered with ash from a volcanic eruption in about 1,500BC. It shows swallows swooping among clusters of red lilliesOne of the reasons for this is that by the time Elgin’s men arrived in Athens in 1800, the Ottomans had ruled Greece for almost 350 years. Countries are forever changing hands, and the Ottomans were, in fact and law, the internationally recognised government of the day. Who else, many ask, should or could Elgin have requested for permission to remove the sculptures to safety?When Elgin got back to Britain, he was suffering from catastrophic debt. He estimated he had spent around £73,600\u0026nbsp(around £3.5m in today’s money) bringing the sculptures to Britain. Parliament offered him £35,000 for the lot, which he accepted. The sculptures went to the British Museum. “It is a myth that Elgin profited hugely from \u0027getting\u0027 the marbles,” Mary Beard explains. “His wife walked out, and he faced bankruptcy, which prompted the sale to the government.” Elgin moved to France, where he died, broken and bankrupt.Once on display in London, the sculptures caused a sensation and started waves of fashion for Greek art and civilisation. “The marbles in London were a vital catalyst for 19th-century Europe\u0027s passion for Greek culture,” explains Dr Greg Sullivan, a leading sculpture historian. “The marbles got into the bloodstream of contemporary 19th-century art. If you attended the Royal Academy art schools or the Derby Mechanics Institute, or if you visited Oxford, Cambridge or Wisbech art galleries, you would be greeted with copies of the statues or casts from the Parthenon frieze.“Flaxman, Westmacott, Gibson, Chantrey. Leighton and Alma-Tadema all acknowledged their influence. It demonstrates how passion for European culture has been a key part of Britishness for centuries, Plaster casts by the British artists Westmacott and Brucciani were given or sold all over Europe to courts and art schools in Germany, Italy, Spain and elsewhere, accelerating the passion for Hellenic civilization. Henning’s miniature relief copies of the frieze were sold and pirated in Paris, Rome, Munich and Vienna.”The sculptures Elgin left in Athens did not fare well. Pollution from the oil refinery at nearby Eleusis eroded many into furry vestiges of their former glories, and a restoration from 1895-1933 by Nicholaos Balanos stapled the sculptures with iron bars which expanded, shattering sections of marble. Fortunately, the casts commissioned by Elgin preserved the details of these sculptures, and have enabled replicas to be made. The British Museum also came in for criticism for an overly abrasive cleaning program in the late 1930s, when it was fashionable to make antique sculptures gleam bright white. However, it was nothing that was not being done at the time to artefacts all over the world, including in Greece. The British Museum subsequently conducted a full investigation, held a conference, and published all results.Looking at all the evidence, Mary Beard concludes: “We must not turn a blind eye to all the problems here, but we should put them in their historical context, without whitewashing or demonising Elgin.”The Elgin Marbles controversy does not, of course, begin and end with Elgin and the wording of his permits. A broader question – which is an increasingly important one – transcends the legal technicalities and asks whether an increasingly culturally sensitive world should be engaging in a general amnesty of cultural artefacts.It is now a real question whether museums should – as a moral act – send objects to the places they were made.\u0026nbspThere can be strong arguments in favour. Some were looted in war. Some would bring tourism to their home regions. Some have ongoing cultural meaning. “To me, the legality of the matter is the least important thing,” says Paul\u0026nbspCartledge. “We don\u0027t actually know what the Sultan\u0027s firman actually permitted Elgin to do. The most important thing is to see what remains of the sculptures – from the British Museum and elsewhere – reunified where they properly can be best appreciated, in the New Acropolis Museum of Athens.”However, against this view is the inevitable sense of loss the world would feel if its principal museums were emptied out. These great “encyclopaedic” or “universal” museums – largely products of the age of Enlightenment – offer a unique opportunity for everyone to experience the interrelationship of all things. In these museums\u0027 vast collections – in Paris, Berlin, St Petersburg, London, Athens and elsewhere – visitors gaze into other cultures, not just into a reflection of their own. They are museums of humanity.Dr Tiffany Jenkins, expert in museums and cultural property, sees strong reasons for artefacts remaining spread around the globe. “The question we should ask is, where is best for the object, in terms of truth, access and preservation? The present situation – where half the remaining sculptures are in Athens and the rest are in London – is a good one. It means the marbles can be seen and understood both in Athens, in the Acropolis Museum close to where they were created, and in London, where they are placed within a universal collection of artefacts from multiple human civilisations.” It is a powerful alternative vision to the idea of restitution, aimed at promoting a wider appreciation of the sculptures.” Jenkins continues: “Like time machines, these museums provide historical context and cross-cultural insight.”The idea of returning objects to their place of origin can also be a challenge if history has moved on. Greece, for instance, did not exist when Pheidias made the sculptures. The Parthenon was a resolutely Athenian project, with the temple used as a treasury for protection money Athens collected from the other Greek city states in the Delian League. Dr James Campbell, fellow in art history and architecture at Cambridge, notes: “It is worth remembering that the Parthenon itself was built on the proceeds of war and taxation and came to be seen by many parts of the Greek world as a symbol of Athenian oppression. It was filled with goods stolen and looted from other cultures.” The Delian League evoked such resentment that it prompted a civil war in which Sparta supplanted Athens as most influential power in the region. So although Greece is unarguably the place where the sculptures were made, they were never a symbol of Greek unity, ancient or modern.“Throughout history, goods have passed across borders and moved from one place to another. Much art fits into this category,”\u0026nbspCampbell continues.\u0026nbsp“Our galleries are full of Italian Masters, Dutch landscapes, French Impressionists. No one is suggesting that every Italian Master belongs to the Italian government. Why, then, do we think the Elgin Marbles belong to the Greek government? Or indeed that the Elgin marbles should be swapped for a better Brexit deal?”Allied to the question of geographical heritage is yet another, more philosophical, perspective. It asks what an object is, and whether an artefact can have more than one identity or tell more than one story. Seen this way, Pheidias\u0027s carvings are simultaneously the Parthenon Sculptures and the Elgin Marbles, and who is to say that both stories should not be told?Dr Tiffany Jenkins elaborates further. “The sculptures have been discarded as well as venerated, seen as historical documents as well as artworks. In the early 19th-century, the Royal Academician Ozias Humphrey, thought them a\u0026nbsp‘mass of ruins’. Most recently at the British Museum they were the centrepiece of a superb exhibition that shed light on the sculpture of Auguste Rodin.”The future of the Parthenon Sculptures is undeniably a decision for Parliament. The British Museum is governed by statute and has no power to give away objects in its collection unless they are duplicates or unfit for retention. Museums also have little interest in the heated and politicised aspects to these debates. On a day-to-day level, museum curators in London, Athens and around the world share with each other and with the public their research, knowledge and an overwhelming love for the objects they care for.16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)North Korea displays ice sculptures of ballistic missileHowever, as the recent Greek overture for negotiations shows, one day Parliament may be called upon to make a decision in the case of the sculptures, and perhaps that day will be soon. But the complex, multidimensional questions raised by the Parthenon Sculptures will need to be appreciated in all their shades and nuances. It will simply not do, as Corbyn has done, to fire from the hip and label them as “stolen” property. Neither can the consequences for universal museums be brushed aside, as if the Parthenon Sculptures go, there will inevitably be calls for a mass resettlement of holdings from across the world.“Today, most school children do not learn Greek,” says James Campbell. “Perhaps the sad reason we are even contemplating giving the contents of the British Museum to the current Greek government is that so few British people understand what the Elgin Marbles are, or care.”Any decision on the future of the Parthenon Sculptures should be a reasoned and responsible one. It is unarguable that more people have seen and fallen in love with Greek sculpture and ancient Greece in the free-to-enter British Museum than in the museum in Athens. The sculptures’ future must be assessed for the good of the world. The Elgin Marbles do not belong to the Conservative Party, and they must not be reduced to a cheap chip in the chaotic poker game of Brexit.Dr Dominic Selwood is a historian and barrister.

ever found discovered in South African cave, archaeologists sayA fragment of stone found in South Africa provides the canvas for what archaeologists believe\u0026nbspis the oldest human drawing ever found.As one of the earliest examples of artistic thinking in humans, the unremarkable-looking rock has given\u0026nbspa unique insight into the minds of our distant ancestors.The cross-hatched pattern drawn in ochre had been buried in Blombos Cave, east of Cape Town, for around 73,000 years.It was unearthed as archaeologists sifted through the debris found on the floor of the cave, which has already yielded a wealth of materials made by our Stone Age ancestors.The researchers examined the marks and even recreated the patterns themselves, concluding they had definitely been deliberately applied with an ochre crayon.Archaeologists used to think the ability of our species to think symbolically did not emerge until Homo sapiens colonised Europe around 40,000 years ago.However, a steady trickle of evidence from places as far apart as Morocco and Indonesia has revealed that humans began practising art far earlier.With the discovery of their red ochre - referred to as a\u0026nbsp“hashtag” in the scientific journal where the study will be published -\u0026nbspthe archaeologists say they have identified a piece that predates previous attempts at abstract drawing by at least 30,000 years.Among the layer of archaeological debris in which the drawing was unearthed, the team also found more evidence of these early humans’ capacity for symbolic thinking.The same ochre that was used to scratch lines on the rock fragment was also used to coat shell beads.On top of this, they found still more pieces of ochre that themselves had been engraved with abstract patterns closely resembling the ones drawn on the stone.\u0026nbsp“This demonstrates that early Homo sapiens in the southern Cape used different techniques to produce similar signs on different media,” said Professor Christopher Henshilwood, who led the study and has been excavating the Blombos Cave since 1991.“This observation supports the hypothesis that these signs were symbolic in nature and represented an inherent aspect of the behaviourally modern world of these African Homo sapiens, the ancestors of all of us today.”The findings were welcomed by professor Alistair Pike, an archaeologist at the University of Southampton who has previously identified art nearly as old as the Blombos stone, but made by Neanderthals.“It’s very exciting but also not very surprising given the amount of symbolic activity that has already been found in the cave,” professor Pike, who was not involved in the new study, told The Independent.However, while there is a chance the scratched ochre discovered in the cave could have been produced in a purely functional way, he said the drawing itself is unambiguously a piece of art.Blombos Cave in the same archaeological debris that yielded the silcrete flake (ErricoHenshilwoodNature)It also ties together the various engravings and beads from around this period with the elaborate cave paintings made by our more recent ancestors.Professor Pike noted that even though this simple piece may appear to be the sign of a more primitive brain, in fact the person who created it would have been no less developed than the creators of the elaborate animal drawings made in Europe thousands of years later.“I guess you can contrast a Jackson Pollock painting with a Giotto and say gosh, those are two very different things – but they are formed by the same symbolic processes and meanings,” he said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this

with Sketch.Rare fossils capture parasites sustaining themselves by feeding on developing fliesClick to followThe IndependentPrehistoric parasitic wasps found frozen inside fossilised victims named \u0027Xenomorphia\u0027 after terrifying creature in Alien filmsScientists have found rare evidence of ancient parasites in action, using advanced techniques to reveal the unpleasant process by which long-extinct wasps preyed on developing insects.\u0026nbspDr Thomas van de Kamp and colleagues examined over 1,500 tiny fossilised fly pupae from around 23 to 66\u0026nbspmillion years ago discovered in France.Within these cocoon-like structures that maggots form before emerging as flies, the scientists used advanced X-ray techniques to reveal adult parasitic wasps growing.In total they found 55 cases of parasitisation taking place, frozen in time inside the tiny fossils for millions of years.Based on this evidence, it seems these wasps injected a single egg inside each pupa, which they grew and consumed the developing fly for sustenance.The scientists\u0026nbspdescribed four new species of wasp, and used a combination of imaging techniques to produce animated reconstructions of one of them, which they termed Xenomorphia resurrecta.The genus “Xenomorphia“ is named after the creature from the Alien\u0026nbspscience fiction film series, which is known as Xenomorph and\u0026nbspdevelops in a similar way to these wasps.\u0026nbspFossil evidence of parasites in action is extremely rare, and the researchers welcomed the opportunity to study the history of parasitic wasps similar to species observed today.“Our project proves that it is worthwhile to study old collections afresh with latest technology,” said Dr\u0026nbspvan de\u0026nbspKamp.Enter your email

The aim of the plan was to allow frictionless trade to continue between the EU and UK after Brexit.If you leave the Union, you are of course no longer part of our single market, and certainly not only in the parts of it you choose.Mr Juncker\u0026nbspdescribed the conduct of his chief negotiator Michel Barnier as “masterful” and reiterated that the official\u0026nbsphad the “unanimous” support of EU member states – who Britain has tried to split off in order to get a better deal, so far unsuccessfully.\u0026nbspThe president’s rejection, which echoes the position of Mr Barnier and diplomats from\u0026nbspmember states, could raise the prospect of\u0026nbspBritain exiting without a deal, because UK government ministers have been clear that they view the choice in talks as one between Chequers and\u0026nbspno deal.Elsewhere in his wide-ranging speech, Mr Juncker, whose term ends after the next European elections in spring 2019, said the EU could easily “impose its position on others” when it spoke with one voice.“When we are united we Europeans, as a union, have become a force to be reckoned with that you cannot do without. Some in Europe were unhappy with the agreement that I reached with President Trump. Some were surprised by it, but there shouldn’t have been a surprise. Whenever Europe speaks as one, we can impose our position on others. Where necessary, Europe must act as one,” he said.‘Poor quality’ Brexit plans at key department risks billions of poundsUK will reject any EU offer of a ‘blind Brexit’, says HammondMay’s Brexit plan ‘substantially worse’ than status quo, says JohnsonThird of UK export firms have already lost business due to BrexitIn what might be interpreted as a veiled dig at British plans to set up its own satellite system after it leaves the EU, Mr Juncker said: “No single member state would’ve been able to launch the satellites that 400 million users around the world are already benefiting from. No member state could have done that on its own.”Elsewhere in the speech Mr\u0026nbspJuncker\u0026nbspsaid his commission would bring forward new rules to ensure elections free from third-party interference, and outlined plans for enhanced trade between the EU and Africa.He also suggested reforms to the EU’s governance structures,\u0026nbspscrapping the requirement for unanimous European Council votes on taxation and foreign policy. That plan is likely to face significant opposition from members states, some of whom are likely to view it as a power-grab.In a veiled reference to US president Donald Trump, he also warned: “Europe can no longer be assured that the commitments entered into in the past will still be respected in the future. Yesterday’s alliances may no longer be tomorrow’s alliances. Today’s world needs a strong united Europe.”Mr Juncker\u0026nbspsaid he wanted to continue work on European defence integration, but denied he was creating an EU army.“If Europe were to unite all the political, economic and military might of its nations, its role in the world could be strengthened,” he said.“This is why – despite great resistance at the time – I reignited the idea of a Europe of Defence as early as 2014.

Guards make clear that visitors are not welcome.Inside, hundreds of ethnic Uighur Muslims spend their days in a high-pressure indoctrination programme, where they are forced to listen to lectures, sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write “self-criticism” essays, according to detainees who have been released.The goal is to rid them of devotion to Islam.Abdusalam Muhemet, 41, said the police detained him for reciting a verse of the Quran at a funeral. After two months in a nearby camp, he and more than 30 others were ordered to renounce their past lives. Mr Muhemet said he went along but quietly seethed.“That was not a place for getting rid of extremism,” he recalled. “That was a place that will breed vengeful feelings and erase Uighur identity.”This camp outside Hotan, an ancient oasis town in the Taklamakan Desert, is one of hundreds that China has built in the past few years. It is part of a campaign of breath-taking scale and ferocity that has swept up hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims for weeks or months of what critics describe as brainwashing, usually without criminal charges.Though limited to China’s western region of Xinjiang, it is the country’s most sweeping internment programme since the Mao era – and the focus of a growing chorus of international criticism.China has sought for decades to restrict the practice of Islam and maintain an iron grip in Xinjiang, a region almost as big as Alaska where more than half the population of 24 million belongs to Muslim ethnic minority groups. Most are Uighurs, whose religion, language and culture, along with a history of independence movements and resistance to Chinese rule, have long unnerved Beijing.After a succession of violent anti-government attacks reached a peak in 2014, Xi Jinping, chief of the Communist Party, sharply escalated the crackdown, orchestrating an unforgiving drive to turn ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities into loyal citizens and supporters of the party.“Xinjiang is in an active period of terrorist activities, intense struggle against separatism and painful intervention to treat this,” Mr Xi told officials, according to reports in the state news media in 2017.In addition to the mass detentions, officials have intensified the use of informers and expanded police surveillance, even installing cameras in some people’s homes.Human rights activists and experts say the campaign has traumatised Uighur society, leaving behind fractured communities and families.“Penetration of everyday life is almost really total now,” said Michael Clarke, an expert on Xinjiang at Australian National University in Canberra, Australia\u0027s capital. “You have ethnic identity, Uighur identity in particular, being singled out as this kind of pathology.”China has categorically denied reports of abuses in Xinjiang. At a meeting of a UN panel in Geneva last month, it said it does not operate re-education camps and described the facilities in question as mild corrective institutions that provide job training.“There is no arbitrary detention,” Hu Lianhe, an official with a role in Xinjiang policy, told the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. “There is no such thing as re-education centres.”World news in picturesParticipants wave flowers as they march past a balcony from where North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong Un was watching, during a mass rally on Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang.

Their accounts were echoed in interviews with more than a dozen Uighurs with relatives who were in the camps or had disappeared, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid government retaliation.The Times also discovered reports online written by teams of Chinese officials who were assigned to monitor families with detained relatives and a 2017 study that said officials in some parts of Xinjiang were indiscriminately sending ethnic Uighurs to the camps to meet numerical quotas.The study, by Qiu Yuanyuan, a scholar at the Xinjiang Party School, where officials are trained, warned that the detentions could backfire and fan radicalism. “Recklessly setting quantitative goals for transformation through education has been erroneously used” in some areas, she wrote. “The targeting is imprecise, and the scope has been expanding.”The Xinjiang government issued “de-radicalisation” rules in 2017 that gave vague authorisation for the camps and many counties now run several of them, according to government documents, including requests for bids from construction companies to build them.In government documents, local officials sometimes liken inmates to patients requiring isolation and emergency intervention.“Anyone infected with an ideological ‘virus’ must be swiftly sent for the ‘residential care’ of transformation-through-education classes before illness arises, a document issued by party officials in Hotan said.The number of Uighurs, as well as Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities, who have been detained in the camps is unclear. Estimates range from several hundred thousand to perhaps one\u0026nbspmillion, with exiled Uighur groups say the number is even higher.China bans \u0027extremist\u0027 Islamic baby names in Muslim provinceThousands protest China\u0027s plans to demolish mosqueChina\u0027s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedInternational community silent as China continues religious crackdownChina \u0027forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol\u0027The Chinese government says it is winning a war against Islamic extremism and separatism, which it blames for attacks that have killed hundreds in recent years. Information about such violence is censored and incomplete, but incidents appear to have fallen off sharply since 2014.Still, many who have emerged from the indoctrination program say it has hardened public attitudes against Beijing.“It was of absolutely no use,” Omurbek Eli, a Kazakh businessman, said of his time held in a camp in 2017. “The outcome will be the opposite. They will become even more resistant to Chinese influence.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/08/qr-code.jpg","title":"china uyghur muslims xinjiang province qr codes security crackdown hrw","story":"Created with Sketch.Officials\u0026nbspcollect\u0026nbspbiometric data including DNA and voice samples,\u0026nbspformer residents sayClick to followThe IndependentA government official scans the code outside a home in Xinjiang provinceChina is installing QR codes on the homes of the\u0026nbspUyghur\u0026nbspMuslim community in order to get instant access to the personal details of people living there, according to a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW).\u0026nbspThe development comes as part of a mass security crackdown on\u0026nbspminorities in Xinjiang province, the charity said,\u0026nbspwhich includes arbitrary detentions, daily restrictions on religious practice and “forced political indoctrination”.\u0026nbspOfficials reportedly scan the “smart” doorplates with mobile devices before entering homes to monitor the inhabitants.Inside China’s ‘re-education centres’ for Uighur MuslimsChina must ‘immediately’ free Muslims from alleged camps, UN saysChina’s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedSophie Richardson, China director at HRW, said: “The Chinese government is committing human rights abuses in Xinjiang on a scale unseen in the country in decades.“The campaign of repression in Xinjiang is a key test of whether the United Nations and concerned governments will sanction an increasingly powerful China to end this abuse.”Authorities claim the codes – which in some locales feature on every home – help with population control and delivery of services.\u0026nbsp“Starting from spring 2017, in every home where one enters there’s a QR code,” one former resident who left Xinjiang, in the far west of the country, told HRW.\u0026nbspFormer residents said authorities are also collecting biometric data, such as DNA and voice samples, when people apply for passports or ID cards,\u0026nbspor during police interrogations.\u0026nbsp“They did take our DNA samples\u0026nbspand iris scans when we applied for the passports,” a middle-aged woman who left Xinjiang last year said. “For those who can read, they read out from a paper but for those who cannot, they said, ‘You can sing a song or tell a story and we will record you’. You aren’t in a position to argue with them.”\u0026nbspShe added people were even forced to walk back and forth at\u0026nbsppolice stations so\u0026nbspofficials\u0026nbspcould record their gait.\u0026nbspThe United Nations human rights panel in August said\u0026nbspChina is believed to be holding up to one\u0026nbspmillion ethnic Uyghurs in a secretive system of “internment camps” in Xinjiang, where they undergo political education.Beijing has denied such camps are for “political education”, insisting\u0026nbspinstead they are vocational training centres, part of government initiatives to bolster economic growth and social mobility in the region.China has said\u0026nbspXinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between Uyghurs who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.Uyghurs and other Muslims held in the camps are forbidden from using Islamic greetings, must learn Mandarin Chinese and sing propaganda songs, according to former camp detainees interviewed by HRW.People in Xinjiang with relatives living abroad in one of 26 “sensitive countries”, including Kazakhstan, Turkey and Indonesia, have reportedly been targeted by the authorities and are often held for several months, without any formal procedure.World news in picturesUm Majid, left, tries an improvised gas mask on family members in her home in Binnish in Syria\u0027s rebel-held northern Idlib province as part of preparations for any upcoming raids.

The UK will always be a very close neighbour and partner, in political, economic and security terms.His remarks, in his annual state of the union speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, were being seen in Whitehall as a further sign that EU negotiators are ready to engage on the details of Mrs May\u0027s proposals.It follows reports from Brussels and Berlin that EU leaders want to alter chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier\u0026rsquos instructions to allow more room to conclude a deal.But they also raised concerns among Euro-sceptic Tories that the Prime Minister will be forced into further compromises with the EU.

It will not be the Commission that will stand in the way of this, I can assure you of that.The EU has frequently claimed a no-deal Brexit will hurt the UK more than Brussels (Image: )Mrs May responded to Mr Juncker\u0027s speech by insisting the UK would not treat the EU as an ordinary third party after Brexit.Speaking at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions in the Commons, she said: I believe a deal that is right for the UK will be a deal that is right for the European Union.She added: When we leave the European Union, we will be an independent sovereign state\u0026mdashwe will have control of our money, our borders and our laws\u0026mdashbut I want to say to our closest allies in Europe - You will also never be an ordinary third party for us.Earlier this week, Mr Barnier claimed a Brexit deal was \u0026ldquopossible within six to eight weeks.But he will today send another signal that Britain will be prepared to quit the bloc without a deal next year if talks fail to make progress.His Whitehall department will release around 30 technical notices more setting out measures the Government, businesses and households should take to be ready for the outcome.The papers will cover mobile phone roaming charges, environmental protections and vehicle standards.Ahead of the release of the documents, the Tory Cabinet minister said last night: With six months to go until the UK leaves the European Union, we are stepping up our \u0027no deal\u0027 preparations so that Britain can continue to flourish, regardless of the outcome of negotiations.These technical notices are part and parcel of our sensible, pragmatic approach to preparing for all outcomes.Getting a deal with the European Union is still by far and away the most likely outcome, and I will continue to champion our Chequers proposals with Michel Barnier as the best way of securing the deep and special partnership we want with the EU.Mr Raab published a first batch of technical notices on no-deal Brexit preparations last month and more are to follow.

YEEEEES!”And for what?Stacey Dooley, that’s what. Star of BBC3’s box office smash Stacey Dooley Investigates: Second Chance Sex Offenders and now Stacey Dooley investigates how many people had to Google her name on Sunday morning.She is by no means, though, the most anonymous of the new batch on the 16th series of Strictly, which was quick to remind us of its past triumphs, and equally swift to jog our memories about all the things that remain wrong with this show.Bruno Tonioli is still there, for starters. So’s Tess with those links that all seem to have passed through about ten light-entertainment BBC sub committees, where they’re vetted for any hint of spontaneity.“Swapping the radio studio for the dance studio.”“Swapping the newsroom for the ballroom.”“Ditching the cricket balls for the glitter balls.”Devotees of the show don’t care about these details, of course, and nor do floating viewers if they throw us a single high-profile comedy bone, in the Ed Balls mould, who can transform Strictly Come Dancing into the funniest show on television.Much like last year’s box-ticking frenzy, though, something has gone badly wrong with the booking process again and the class of 2018 has no maverick entertainer, just a lot of people you might vaguely recognise off the telly.Among the slightly more famous contestants there’s dance-trained Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts, Steps’ Faye Tozer, Lee Ryan out of Blue, Kate “The Silverback” Silverton, from BBC News, cricketer Graeme Swann and Susannah Constantine, who seemed to have got lost on the way to the Loose Women studio and mentioned “the menopause” before she’d even done her Mrs Overall impression in that group dance.Once through that lot, though, you’re into Stacey Dooley territory with Danny John-Jules, a Paralympian, some bloke called Charles off Casualty, who warmed the nation’s heart by referring to himself in the third person, and comedian Seann Walsh, who confirmed: “I’m not here to make anyone laugh.”A statement that should be all over Seann’s Edinburgh Fringe poster every year.The two bookings that irked me most, though, were local radio DJ Vick Hope, whose only recognisable feature is her perfume  and internet vlogger Joe Sugg, whose presence really did flag up TV’s general failure if 13million people are logging on to watch this bloke put cling film over his mate’s toilet bowl.It also told me, without much competition from The X Factor, Strictly’s got complacent and rather full of itself.The solution would seem obvious, though. Rip up the flat fee booking system, drop the salaries of the makeweights and spend the excess on a marquee booking like Richard Madeley, Prezza, Eamonn Holmes, Cherie Blair or Farage, who’d empty Britain’s streets with his jive.This is not just my opinion, obviously. Almost everyone who’s looked at this year’s Strictly line-up has concluded it’s not good enough.You can be pretty damn sure then the BBC will take the criticism on board, channel the opinions through a thousand sub-committees and conclude that, yes, unequivocally what this show needs is same sex couples.We live in nutty times.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “JFK: Remembering Jack is a book about which man?”Emma: “Pass.”Bradley Walsh: “2017, The Queen’s Sapphire Jubilee, marked how many years on the throne?”Emma: “100.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which UK Prime Minister starred in the 2003 episode of The Simpsons?”Mikayla: “Winston Churchill.”Bradley Walsh: “In the 1930s, Caroline Mikkelsen became the first woman to set foot in what continent?”Barrie: “Australia.”A CRACKING new series of Celebrity Island with Bear Grylls was immediately transformed into Fantasy Island on Sunday night, thanks to the arrival of Roxanne Pallett, who made an early promise/threat.“If someone gets stung by a jellyfish,” she claimed, earnestly, “I would wee on them.”And if they didn’t get stung? Roxanne would probably p*** on them from a great height anyway.You feared, then, for the latest selection of male celebs, James Cracknell, Anthony Ogogo, Martin Kemp, Towie’s Pete Wicks and star of The Specialist Eric Roberts, an obvious Hollywood casualty who still boasted: “I’ve been nominated for an Academy Award and three Golden Globes, and I’ve had so much fun I can’t see straight.”Yeah, can’t see straight, can’t stay awake and can’t remember anyone’s name either, so he started calling Martin Kemp “Colin”. Eric’s fantastic entertainment, though, and unlike the others has the gifts of honesty and intuition, so he was having none of Roxanne’s Penelope Pitstop routine.First she succumbed to “trench foot”. Then she was rescued from the water after her leg became dangerously entangled with the voices in her head, and finally Roxanne had to be evacuated from the island when the camp fire ignited long-buried memories of a teenage house fire.A tale of the unexpected that earned her a fond farewell from the other islanders and a muttered aside from Eric.“That story. When’s the movie coming out?”About the same time as The Specialist II.Alan Shearer: “After two defeats, Fulham have got a win and a victory.”Matt Murray: “If England had gone on and got that second goal, they’d have gone on and got it.”Neil Warnock: “The bookies are never wrong, but they weren’t right last year.”Lee Dixon: “You can sing about England’s midfield about as long as the cow’s come home.”THERE will be no more lift-exiting or corridor- charging for Keeley Hawes after BBC1’s Bodyguard killed off her Home Secretary Julia Montague on Sunday night.A revelation that may have one or two of you screaming: “Thanks for the spoiler alert,” but tough luck. The rest of us are fed up putting everything on hold for stragglers who think the world revolves around their schedule.And anyway, codes of silence should exist only for those truly great dramas, like The Sopranos or ER, which understand you have to earn the right to kill off one of your main characters and jumping that gun smacks of arrogance.As popular as it’s been, Bodyguard clearly isn’t in this bracket.It’s far too full of plot holes and box-ticking to be anywhere near Sopranos class, in fact, and Richard Madden’s Sergeant Zoolander character doesn’t begin to look capable of carrying the show on his own.Don’t, however, rule out the possibility of a last-minute redemption.If Bodyguard really is as edgy, risk-taking, different-from-the-herd and brilliant as writer Jed Mercurio seems to think, then it’ll conclude the person responsible for the explosions, death and every other misery visited on humanity wasn’t a white, middle-class man.I’m not exactly holding my breath here, though.On Friday’s This Morning, Eamonn Holmes announces: “Next, masturbation, we’re getting stuck into that.Martin Lewis is here at 10:45, Matthew Wright’s popping in at ten past 11 . . .”And if Jamie Oliver appears, we’ve got a whole studio full of them.THIS week’s winner is Kim Woodburn and Mata, from The Emperor’s New Groove.Emailed in by James McGuire.

The first night will culminate in a “festival and funfair”-themed party where 500 guests including Naomi Campbell, George Clooney and Kate Moss will ride dodgems and play on coconut shies as Robbie Williams and Ellie Goulding perform.So far, so OTT.And good for her! If Princess Eugenie wants a Big Fat Royal Wedding, she should have one. Why not get Gypsy Wedding stitcher Thelma Madine to team up with Chanel and make a £50,000, 20st, glow-in-the-dark dress?Why doesn’t Eugenie ride to the church in a giant horse-drawn orb like Katie Price or say her vows on golden Beckham-style thrones?It is beautiful Eugenie has found love — she should celebrate however she wants. But where Eugenie’s special day crosses into outrageous is in expecting the public to pay her gigantic security bill.Eugenie’s insistence on being paraded through the streets of Windsor like Marie Antoinette means security is now going to cost us, the taxpayers, an astronomical TWO MILLION POUNDS.Officers on overtime rates will be drafted in, with dozens required to search the procession route in advance.Hard-working Brits who have struggled with eight years of austerity and been exhausted by endless police cuts will bear the brunt of that extra policing so we might catch a glimpse of Eugenie sashaying past in her open-top carriage.Is this what Eugenie meant when she said in a recent interview that she wanted to “share our world” with us?There’s nothing more tasteless than asking other people to pay for your extravagant wedding.Recently a story went viral about a bridezilla called Susan who’d demanded her friends cough up towards her £47,000 bash.Yet Eugenie’s demands make small change of that. As her guests romp on dodgems and get hammered on cocktails, we’ll be hoping we don’t get stabbed or sprayed with acid on the way to the shops because there probably won’t be many cops to help us.Extreme? Maybe not when we hear — as we did last month — that a third of bobbies on the beat have been axed in the past three years, while crime has shot up.Some fed-up villagers have even started paying for their own security firms.You hear that, Eugenie? Paying for their own security!Indeed, we might ask why Eugenie’s dad, Prince Andrew, worth some £65million, isn’t dipping into his reservoir of cash to pay the security bill?It is he who is apparently so keen for Eugenie to make a carriage-drawn arrival at church. Just as Andrew was adamant his daughters should retain Princess status in the face of Prince Charles’ worthy attempts to slim down the monarchy.Perhaps Eugenie’s groom Jack Brooksbank — the great-grandson of Sir John Spencer Coke, the son of the 2nd Earl of Leicester — might stump up some cash?Or Eugenie herself could contribute? Even if it might mean troubling her £3.6million trust funds or taking one fewer holiday this year?In an interview with Vogue Eugenie spoke with her sister Beatrice about wanting to be seen as “real”.Yet in some ways, “real” is exactly what Eugenie is. A marginal royal, she has no official royal function.She is not responsible for carrying out any royal engagements or public duties. For us, then, she does nothing.For Prince Harry, it made sense to indulge in a whistles-and-bells Royal Wedding .People like Harry, you see. Harry performs royal duties . He has served in the Forces and established the Invictus Games. An psos Mori poll this year had him and his gran — aka the Queen — as the world’s most favourite royals. For us Brits he was the favourite.But we can’t and shouldn’t roll out the platinum carpet for every minor royal who ties the knot. To do so makes a mockery of the royals’ claims they want to modernise.It reinforces the dated and offensive notion that the aristocracy are born to deserve better than us.In that Vogue interview Eugenie spoke about how she wanted her wedding to be plastic-free. How very woke.I just wish this supposedly modern royal was as conscious of social inequality as she is of the environmentOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nor commit a penny of our divorce bill without tying it to a decent deal.It would be fatal for her. Chequers looks almost dead as it is. Even if Barnier breathes life into it, many Tories are still vowing to vote it down.IT’S easy to dismiss Boris Johnson’s call for tax cuts as a ruse to distract from his personal difficulties.

Why are up to 9 million people in the UK lonely?The truth is there are multiple reasons including technology reducing the need for face-to-face contact although we do acknowledge the power that it has to bring people together as well.There are fewer people participating in community groups or speaking even just to their next-door neighbours.An increasing number of jobs being done remotely or alone, which means that even work is becoming isolating.When we’re talking about younger age groups and their propensity towards loneliness that could be as a consequence to that digital connection and the difference between having a virtual relationship and a real relationship.At the same time, for older people, that access to technology could be the solution to loneliness and isolation.Loneliness has previously been thought to mostly affect the elderly. But a study by the Office for National Statistics found found students are more likely than over-75s to be socially isolated.Figures published in April showed 10% of 16 to 24-year-olds were often or always lonely, compared with just 3% of pensioners.The survey showed 23% of young adults said they were lonely some of the time, falling to 18% for the 25 to 34 age group and to 17% among over-75s.Dr Dawn Snape, from the ONS, yesterday told the Public Health England annual conference that social media is creating new problems for younger generations.She said: This is a pervasive thing and this existed since time immemorial. But there are some new things as well.Children, who are hugely, hugely connected, young people who are hugely connected, within the space of seconds can know that they have been left out of something and can see it happening in real time.That they are being left out of something that their friends are doing, that is happening right now and they are sitting there for three hours watching their friends at a party knowing everything that is happening at the party that they haven’t been invited to.I think that’s the first generation that has had to deal with that, and the repercussions of that.I have children aged 16 and 18 and talking to them about it, they say definitely it is horrifying.You are watching this happening and you feel terribly lonely... the desperation of feeling that you have been left out of a friendship group.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you’ve got nothing better to do, go and find yourself some work, because that’s the best cure for stupid personality nonsense”.Other senior Leavers also pledged their loyalty to Mrs May, for now.ERG chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg dubbed the PM “worthy of our support”, adding: “I have long said that the policy needs to be changed, but I am supporting the person”.Brexiteer loyalist Cabinet minister Michael Gove also warned the angry rebels that their scheming is putting Brexit itself at risk.The Environment Secretary implored: ““The critical thing is we need to make sure we have unity in the Conservative Party behind the Prime Minister’s proposition.“This is loose talk. Any diversion or distraction from that mission means our ability to deliver on the referendum mandate is undermined.”Other Brexiteers claimed the ERG hot heads were allowed to run riot at the meeting as most of its more senior figures were not there – including Bernard Jenkin, David Davis, Owen Patterson, Boris Johnson and IDS, as well as Mr Rees-Mogg himself.No new leader could change the fact this Government has no majority.

It doesn’t look a goer.But the focus of every Tory MP, even above Brexit, should be keeping Corbyn out. The last thing they need is a traumatic, protracted leadership contest.Senior Brexiteers are right to put the lid back on the plot.Mrs May is their lightning rod in the Brexit storm. Toppling her at this point would be madnessBut just hours fears of a Brexiteer coup receded, Downing Street were hit with the incendiary interview from Mr Tugedenhat - who is on the left of the party - appearing in The Spectator.The MP for Tonbridge in Kent, said the Tories had to start talking “about the optimism we feel in the country”.And in a further dig at Theresa May the boss of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said he had “noticed” that recent government policies have focused on banning things or raising taxes.Asked what he would do with the keys to No10, he made a passionate plea to simplify the tax system, reform business rates and rescue the high street.But he risked ridicule from Ministers after demanding Defence spending be hiked from 3 to 5 per cent of GDP - a raise in of more than £45 billion.Mr Tugendhat hit the headlines last month after revealing he juggled home life and his career as an MP by changing his baby daughter’s nappy while taking part in a live radio grillings.He said: “If I have an interview to do I just have to hope they don’t wake up and, if they do, that they’ll accept their breakfast in silence... or will let me change nappies without making a sound.

I agree with you.“You said twice that we need to come to a free trade deal. It’s what European exporters want and it’s what we want.“Surely now the time is right, the ground is prepared for a Canada plus style trade deal between you and us.“We leave political union but we carry on doing business on a tariff-free basis. We want it, increasingly I think you want it. Let’s get Brexit sorted.”And Tory MEP David Campbell Bannerman told The Sun: “President Juncker used his speech to warn Chequers is not acceptable to the EU.“He strongly suggests a free trade agreement such as Super Canada when he talks of a free trade area.“Tusk and Barnier have both offered a 100% tariff and quota free deal that effectively means a free trade area with only some electronic customs forms.“We should accept this offer and we can then deliver a great trade deal for November.”He added: “I very much welcome the new, more flexible approach the EU has taken to the Northern Ireland border.“A creative solution, as Juncker put it, is exactly what we need.”However, EU officials cautioned that British ministers were likely to be disappointed by Brussels’ interpretation of what a free trade area entails.A senior source told The Sun: “The problem with free trade areas is that, like free trade agreements, they’re everything but free trade.“They eliminate many restrictions, but the problem here is whatever type of deal we arrive at, you’ll always end up with a certain degree of friction.During the speech Mr Juncker also had a dig at UK plans to build a rival to the Galileo satellite.He said: “A strong, united Europe will allow its member states to reach for the stars. Europe is still in the space race. No Member State could’ve done that on its own. Galileo is a success story, primarily a European success story. Without Europe there would be no Galileo.”Elsewhere, Mr Juncker said the EU should do away with the need for Member States to agree unanimously on foreign policy decisions and tax laws.But his speech prompted accusations from eurosceptics that he is trying to erode the role of individual countries and create a federal Europe.Mr Farage said: “All of this means less to be done at the nation state level. It’s all about centralisation. Power, power, power.”The EU Parliament said Eurocrats should trigger sanctions which could lead to Budapest’s voting rights in Brussels being revoked.Euro MPs approved a report accusing the regime of migrant abuse, press control, corruption, surveillance and misogyny.Hungary called the decision-making “fraudulent”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My father has been really unwell recently and has heart problems.I spend a lot of time shielding my parents from what is on the internet about Reeva. We dont need pictures of her blood stains to be seen at all after such a long time.The new documentary reveals for the first time that Pistorius received a mysterious picture message shortly before the murder raising questions over whether this sparked a row between the pair.It was previously thought that the blade runner had  launched into a jealous rage after reading a message on Reevas phone.But the production crew obtained phone records showing Pistorius was sent a message at 1.48am on February 14, 2013 - around 10 minutes before a neighbour claimed to have heard shouting from the house.As part of the documentary, journalist Toby Shapshak explains that the message had the equivalent of 58kb of data, and claims it could have been a photograph or a WhatsApp message.It comes after Reevas mother June revealed she has forgiven her daughters killer, adding that she is done with the Paralympian.June Steenkamp told South African newspaper The Citizen: “I am not interested in Oscar Pistorius, I am finished with that.It’s up to the justice system now – I have no interest whatsoever in him.

It has been five years and I have had enough now.”Pistorious was initially found not guilty of her murder, but convicted of culpable homicide and was jailed for five years.But furious prosecutors appealed the verdict and the Supreme Court overturned his conviction, finding him guilty of murder in December 2015, and he was sentenced to six years.In November 2017, Pistorious had his jail sentence increased to 13 years and five months.In March 2018, he lost his appeal against his 13-year sentence."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433237387.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sun says conservative party theresa may","story":"No new leader could change the fact this Government has no majority.

If affected, it is important to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration.To reduce the risk to others, stay off nursery, school or work, avoid preparing food and minimise direct contact with others until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped.Mr Young said outbreaks could be difficult to control as it could be easily transmitted.He said: The most effective way to respond to an outbreak is to clean and disinfect contaminated areas very thoroughly and to institute good hygiene measures including hand-washing.The school have taken these measures and issued advice to children, parents and staff.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433515505-e1536831998935.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince harry helicopter arrival royal marines recruits","story":"The nimble-footed Duke of Sussex was pictured hopping out of the chopper as it landed for his visit to The Royal Marines Commando Training Centre in Lympstone, East Devon.The 33-year-old took on the role of Captain General Royal Marines at the end of last year, succeeding the role from his grandfather Prince Philip.Dressed in cream trousers and a tie, Meghans new husband seemed keen to meet with the Marines as they stood to attention for his first visit to the Commando Training Centre since taking on the role.He is said to have a good relationship with the Corps, having fought alongside them in Afghanistan during his time as an Apache helicopter pilot.Harry— known as Captain Harry Wales in the Army — served two tours of Afghanistan from 2007 to 2008 and 2012 to 2013 before leaving in 2015.Prince Harry particularly made sure to speak to new recruits undergoing training as well as the Invictus Games Racing Team.The royal created the games after being inspired by the US Warrior Games, a similar sporting event for injured service personnel.And he got to see the Marines in full action today, with some pictured exercising on huge courts.Others were seen hauling themselves up ropes as part of their training.Tweeting a photograph of the royal speaking with officers, Kensington Palace said: What an amazing welcome from the Royal Marines!The Commando Training Centre trains all the Royal Marines officers, recruits and reserves, as well as providing an onsite rehabilitation centre.The Queen gave her formal approval for Prince Harrys new role, continuing the Royal Familys long-standing association with the amphibious light infantry.As part of the role, previous Captain Generals have visited the Marines in Norway, as well as touring the headquarters of 3 Commando Brigade in Plymouth.The Duke of Edinburgh carried out his last official duty as Captain General in December last year.The Dukes association with the Royal Marines dates back 64 years to 2nd June 1953, when he was appointed Captain General in succession to the late King George VI.At the time of the Duke of Edinburgh standing down, Major General Rob Magowan, Commandant General Royal Marines, thanked him for his commitment to the Corps.He said: In an ever-changing world, His Royal Highness has remained a reassuring constant.The Duke’s interest, support, encouragement, inspiration and ready humour will be sorely missed.I am delighted by the announcement that Her Majesty The Queen has appointed Prince Harry to be our next Captain General."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT00043351960","title":"dog jack russell refuses eat wotsits supermarket","story":"Footage shows fussy little bugger Patch cautiously smell each crisp when offered one by owner Dan Huby.He carefully avoids the cheaper rival and only accepts the branded Walkers snacks.Restaurant manager Dan, 31, even tried to trick his picky pet by swapping a Wotsit into a Cheese Puffs bag — but the snooty pooch was having none of it.Although Wotsits are corn snacks and Cheese Puffs are made of maize, Dan admits he doesn’t think the rival brands taste much different.Dan, from Ventnor on the Isle of Wight, said: “He loves Wotsits.

But the UK will continue to receive space, surveillance and tracking data from America.Companies which export so-called non-harmonised goods - items such as furniture, bicycles and cooking tools which are governed by national rules rather than EU-wide regulations - may need new licences to continue selling them into Europe under a No Deal scenario.And shipping firms could be hit by additional red tape, the documents added.But ministers have also taken actions to minimise the disruption of a No Deal Brexit - such as saying we will continue to observe EU rules on the environment no matter what the outcome of Brexit talks.The right to travel freely between Britain and Ireland will continue even if there is no deal, under the rule of the Common Travel Area.And Irish citizens will “continue to enjoy the reciprocal rights” to live in the UK, as well as “work, study and vote, [and get] access to social welfare benefits and health services”.The Home Office says this will be the same for British citizens in Ireland.Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer rubbished todays announcements, saying: “The only reason the Government is talking about No Deal is because the Tory civil war on Europe prevents the Prime Minister from negotiating a good deal.And pro-EU MP David Lammy, a backer of the Best for Britain campaign, said: As these papers show, a No Deal Brexit will not only kneecap the British economy, disproportionately hurting the poorest. It will also make life more difficult in innumerable ways - affecting driving licences, passports and phone bills.Today is just a cynical ploy by the Government to make whatever pathetic little deal they bring back from Brussels look less bad in comparison.Cabinet ministers met this morning to discuss the No Deal contingency plans which are designed to ensure Britain is ready for the possible collapse of talks with Brussels.Speaking before the plans were published, Dominic Raab warned rebel MPs they will have no choice but to back Theresa May - or risk Brexit chaos.He said Brexit rebels would have to be responsible and rubbished the idea they can force through an alternative plan by next March.Tory MPs from all sides of the Brexit divide have called for the PM to chuck her proposals set out at Chequers.But the Brexit Secretary said it would be impossible to replace Mrs Mays blueprint with a different type of trade deal.He told the BBCs Today programme: When push comes to shove it will be a binary choice between the deal we bring back and No Deal, and I think that will focus minds.Colleagues will look at the choices theyve got and theyve got to be responsible for that.During the interview he also hit out at firms such as John Lewis which blame their economic troubles on Brexit.Mr Raab said: I think there will be the temptation from some businesses that arent doing so well to blame Brexit and I think thats a mistake.He confirmed that we wont pay a £39billion divorce bill if we dont manage to secure a withdrawal agreement.Mr Raab said: Its not a threat, its statement of fact as part of our No Deal planning.We would be mindful of our strict legal obligations, but the amount and the phased way it is set out in the withdrawal agreement would fall away because there would be no deal.DOZENS of Brexit-backing Tory MPs are furious with Theresa Mays Chequers plan, which would see Britain following EU rules for goods even after weve left.They have launched a huge campaign to persuade the PM to drop her proposals and replace them with a looser free-trade deal.Some hardliners are even trying to ditch Mrs May altogether - convinced that only a Brexit true believer can truly carry out the will of the people.But both efforts are massively complicated by the fact that we have just six months before Britain officially leaves the EU.Senior Brexiteers are in despair about the leadership chatter, warning that if the PM was forced out Remainers would seize the opportunity to delay or even overturn Brexit.And as Dominic Raab points out today, the short timeline makes it difficult for any plan other than Mrs Mays to take shape.If Britain and the EU do thrash out a withdrawal deal later this year, it will almost certainly be based on the PMs Chequers deal.MPs will have a straight choice when it comes to a Commons vote - support the deal as it stands, or back No Deal.Ministers are gambling that enough Tories will lose their nerve and vote with the Government to outnumber the rebels who team up with Jeremy Corbyn to try and defeat it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

taking place in eastern Siberia close to the border with China - involve 300,000 Russian troops as well as joint exercises with the Chinese army.This is the first time our army and fleet have undergone such a difficult and large-scale test, said President Putin.The exercises, that involve over a thousand military aircraft as well as up to 36,000 tanks, come amid tense relations between Russia and the West that have fallen to a post-Cold War low.Speaking at the Tsugol firing range about 80 miles north of the border with China, Putin said Russia was a peaceful country ready for cooperation with any state interested in partnership, but that it was a soldiers duty to be ready to defend his country and its allies.Therefore we are going to further strengthen our armed forces, supply them with the latest generations of weapons and equipment, develop international military partnership, he said.The Chinese media have described the Peoples Liberation Army involvement in the drills as the countrys largest-ever dispatch of forces abroad for war games.Russia has said it is showcasing methods developed during its military intervention in Syria, giving Chinese forces - which havent fought in a war since 1979 - a glimpse of real combat skills.The five-day mock battles involve more than DOUBLE the number of recruits currently in the entire British armed forces.NATO has already condemned the war games as a rehearsal for large-scale conflict” - and experts say they are without doubt the largest in modern Russian history.It fits into a pattern we have seen over some time - a more assertive Russia, significantly increasing its defence budget and its military presence,” warned an alliance spokesman.The Russian army has compared the show of force to the USSRs 1981 Zapad war games that saw around 150,000 Warsaw Pact soldiers take part in the largest military exercises of the Soviet era.Yet the drills - to take place across several training grounds - will dwarf even this notorious exercise when it comes to scale.Military leaders released video footage of military vehicles, planes, helicopters and ships getting into position for the initial stage of the drills.The jaw-dropping numbers involved in the Vostok-2018 include:The Chinese claimed the vast operation was not directed against any third party and would focus purely on defences, firepower strikes and counterattack.”But close Putin ally Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defence minister, said the games would be at an unprecedented scale both in territory and number of troops involved”.He declared: Imagine 36,000 military vehicles moving at the same time: tanks, armoured personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles  - and all of this, of course, in conditions as close to a combat situation as possible.”The manoeuvres are billed as testing the combat skills of the Russian land, air and naval forces.Putin’s spokesman said last month that maintaining Russias defence capabilities is justified, needed and has no alternative as rival powers are frequently quite aggressive and unfriendly”.The Russian army is rolling out its latest weaponry - Iskander missiles that can carry nuclear warheads, T-80 and T-90 tanks and its recent Su-34 and Su-35 fighter planes.At sea, the Russian fleet is deploying several frigates equipped with Kalibr missiles that have been used in Syria.For weeks Russia has been preparing for the drills - at one point closing a road so planes could land near Khabarovsk, and firing missiles from land, surface and submarine at a target in the Sea of Okhotsk.The war games are underway at five ranges in the east of Russia, and in the waters of the Sea of Japan, Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk.The deployment comes after an exercise last year in collaboration with Belarus in the west of the country which involved an announced 13,000 troops.Putin has spent hundreds of billions in recent years carrying out a major modernisation of the creaking forces he inherited from the Soviet era.Separately he has a large convoy in the Arctic and some 25 warships in the Mediterranean – the biggest deployment since the deployed forces in Syria three years ago.Ahead of the games, Russian forces unleashed a devastating display involving synchronised launches from land, surface vessel and submarine hitting targets in the Sea of Okhotsk.The live-fire exercise hit two drifting targets in the Sea of Okhotsk on Russia’s Pacific coast as Putin was on a trip to Siberia.Four different types of cruise missile were used in the attack - Vulkan, Granit, Malakhit and Onyx.They were fired from the missile cruiser Varyag - flagship of the Pacific fleet - as well as missile corvettes Razliv and Moroz, and the Tomsk nuclear powered submarine.They were supported by the Bastion missile system fired from land  and the distance of the targets was between 155 and 310 miles.“All seven cruise missiles successfully hit the targets,” said a statement from Russia’s eastern military district.Earlier vehicles were halted on the Khabarovsk to Komsomolsk-on-Amur motorway to allow Su-30SM, Su-35S and MiG-31 pilots to test their landing and takeoff skills on the narrow road, according to local reports.Military Mi-26 helicopters also swooped in to land on the highway, and an An-26 was seen touching down on the two-lane road.Halted motorists filmed the amazing scenes as they got a grandstand view for the military exercise close to the Chinese border in the Russian Far East.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The decision comes almost two years since French authorities bulldozed the squalid camp for migrants and refugees near the English Channel. At the time of the clearance in October 2016, 769 unaccompanied children were transferred to the UK, and all claimed asylum in the country. Of those, 220 were given sanctuary under a new law pioneered by Labour peer Lord Dubs, who fled the Nazis to Britain as a child. Today ministers announced the other 549 - who came to the UK because they already had family here - will be given a special leave status allowing them to remain.  Home Office minister Caroline Nokes said Calais was a unique situation in which children were at risk of violence and abuse. Yet 1,300 more child refugees, who were refused entry to the UK at the time, were not so lucky. Last month the Court of Appeal branded the handling of their case unfair and unlawful and found the Home Office misled a judge with an incomplete picture of the evidence. The Government assessed around 2,000 children before and after the clearance of the makeshift refugee camp in 2016. The court found about 1,300 of those children had been given either inadequate reasons, or none at all, for being refused passage to the UK from France.

Conservative MEPs opposed a motion in the European Parliament condemning Orban for attacking Muslim and Jewish minorities and suppressing free speech and press freedom. The Tories were the only governing party in Western Europe to vote in support of the Hungarian PM.  The Article 7 motion was carried by 448-197 in a move which could see Hungary face sanctions and stripped of its voting rights in Brussels.  Mr Orban has been accused of fostering anti-semitism with his “relentless campaign” against the Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros. One of the UK’s leading Jewish organisations, the Board of Deputies, said it was disappointed Conservative MEPs had voted in defence of Hungary’s far-right government.  “As we have stated previously, we are very alarmed by the messages at the heart of Orban’s election campaign, including his comments about ‘Muslim invaders’, calling migrants ‘poison’, and the vivid anti-semitism in the relentless campaign against Jewish philanthropist George Soros. “This whipping up of prejudice by the Hungarian government – alongside restrictions on press freedom and the independence of the judiciary – must be stopped before it undermines Hungary’s democracy irreversibly. “It is very concerning that the Conservative Party MEPs chose to defend Hungary’s appalling track record, rather than supporting this motion to protect the rule of law,” the Board said.  The statement comes just days after Theresa May attacked Jeremy Corbyn in the Commons for failing to tackle anti-semitism in the Labour ranks.   The Muslim Council of Britain raised concerns the Tories had refused to vote against Mr Orban because they needed his support on Brexit .  The council’s secretary general Harun Khan told the Independent: “At a time when there are growing concerns about the rise of the far-right across Europe, it is deeply disappointing that Conservative Party MEPs were whipped to align themselves with far-right parties in supporting Mr Orban.

This cheap and highly addictive drug ruins lives and is a blight on communities.  “The unpleasant and sometimes frightening scenes being witnessed on our streets as a direct result of spice dealing and use are simply unacceptable and must not be tolerated.” He said tackling the crisis required “Government taking decisive action on Spice now, rather than shrugging this off as just a problem for the North”.

The designs for a metal cage were submitted in 2016. But they have recently surfaced on social media - as the company faces increasing pressure over their alleged treatment of staff. According to the documents, the metal structures were originally designed to carry employees around the warehouses.  It is thought that the cages were designed as a way to protect staff from robots whizzing around the packing areas, Business Insider reports.   They were apparently designed to help them navigate areas populated by machines. The patent, titled System and Method for transporting Personnel within an active Workspace, was unearthed in a recent paper by the AI ethics researchers Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler. The patent submitted on March 8 describes the cage as a human transport device. The design has attracted ire on social media from some users horrified by the idea. Amazon\u0027s senior vice president of operations, Dave Clark, wrote on Twitter that it was never used, saying: even bad ideas get submitted for patents. He added: This was never used and we have no plans for usage.

Officers from Derbyshire Constabulary were on their way to another job when they came across the two-vehicle crash. They saw the spotted smoke billowing from one of the cars and knew that they had to act quickly. Michael Bradshaw had broken both legs as well as serious fractures to his ribs and arms. One of ankle and foot had also become separated in the head-on collision.  One of the officers told DerbyshireLive , that despite not being able to save his life, they did give him extra time to say goodbye to his family.  PC Pete Robinson said: “We were travelling to another job and went round a corner in the road and were faced with carnage. We think that it happened just a few moments before we arrived. We had to call off what we were going to and deal with this incident.  PC Meek said: “There were two cars involved that had hit head-on, and one car was completely crushed. “Then the crushed car started to smoke. We took our out fire extinguishers and reported the incident. “It took about five minutes for other officers to join us at the scene. “Unfortunately, there was nothing that we could do for the person in the crushed car except keep the flames under control. “But there was a risk that the flames would spread to the other car so we had to take the decision to pull the other driver out of the vehicle.” PC 14193, who didn\u0027t wish to be named, said: “We attended because we are advanced first aiders. We went to the smashed car and we tried to fight the flames but we could not get to him. “So we concentrated on the one in the other car. “He suffered many injuries.

The incident was captured by a security camera on the door. He told the Mirror: So I ordered a package from Amazon expecting my wife to be home as she was on maternity leave. She was out at an appointment at the time of delivery.  I usually use my ring video doorbell to ask people to leave the package in a refuse cupboard by my front door if I\u0027m not home. In this instance I missed the bell on my phone so the driver simply decided it was appropriate to lob the package onto my first floor balcony. My wife came home confused to find the package there outside. The man posted a video of what happened on Linkedin and wrote: #busted Amazon . Apparently lobbing a package onto my 1st floor balcony is an acceptable way to deliver these days ...

I would recommend instead of putting \u0027mums\u0027, put parents or carers. It would just mean a small change. In this world today we shouldn\u0027t just rely on women. Hannah-Marie was amazed when she received the reply from Kellogg\u0027s. It said: You recently shared your thoughts around the statement of \u0027Approved by Mums\u0027 on our improved recipe Coco Pops. I wanted to let you know that we\u0027ve recently renewed our research and our new pack design will refer to approval from both mums and dads.  Apologies for any offence caused and thank you for your feedback, which has played a part in our decision to change. Anne-Marie, an airline cabin crew leader, said: Hannah-Marie does voice her opinions and asks questions about why things are done in a certain way. I work for an airline and I am away quite a lot, so my husband is there for breakfast. When Hannah-Marie said she thought the quote on the box was sexist we asked her why. Hannah-Marie felt strongly that the \u0027Approved by Mums\u0027 label should include dads, or even grandparents and carers, so I told her if she wanted to make a change she should write to Kellogg\u0027s. I provided the stamps and we looked up the address for the customer services team online and she just got on with it. When we got home from holiday and found a reply, Hannah-Marie was absolutely delighted. She\u0027s not an openly emotional child but she had a very big smile on her face.

Scotland Yard has asked the Home Office to fund the investigation for six more months, the Daily Star reported. Failure to secure the money would mean Operation Grange would be shelved in just three weeks time as government cash runs out. The Home Office said yesterday they have not yet received a funding request but said any new bid would be \u0027carefully considered.\u0027 A politan Police spokesman told The Star: “The investigation continues and we are in dialogue with the Home Office over more funding.”  Detectives still searching for missing Madeleine have not uncovered any significant new leads in their latest trips to Portugal, where the toddler vanished in May 2007. politan Police\u0027s Operation Grange has cost taxpayers \u0026pound11.6m since being launched 11 years ago. Last week it was revealed that detectives bought five return flights for two separate trips to Portugal for the last financial year.  A Freedom of Information request showed that the fares to the country cost \u0026pound1,240, including \u0026pound811 for accommodation claimed by senior investigating officer Det Chief Insp Nicola Wall. Kate and Gerry McCann face another \u0027D-Day\u0027 where they fear the search for their daughter, codenamed Operation Grange, could be indefinitely suspended in the absence of fresh information. Earlier it was reported Kate and Gerry McCann have vowed “the search will go on” for their missing girl amid reports police could shelve their hunt.

Dramatic footage shows the customers arm grip the neck of the employee in an apparent headlock as other staff try to break up the fight. It is not clear why the fight broke out, and McDonald\u0027s are yet to comment, but it is said to have taken place at a branch in Shelpherd\u0027s Bush in West London. Police have no record of the incident last Saturday that saw a number of customers and staff involved. People can be heard shouting loudly during the clip, which was shot by a bystander, and begins with the male employee and customer already locked in the brawl.  Screams of horror can be heard as the man, wearing a black hoodie with multi-coloured stripes, seemingly has the McDonald\u0027s male employee in a tight headlock. Meanwhile two burly McDonald’s security staff can be seen trying to reach the warring pair through the crowds in the restaurant. A man in a white hoodie who appears to be a friend of the fighting customer tries to push the McDonald\u0027s staff off him and shouts “Get off him! Get off him!”. The restaurant’s security staff attempt to intervene and order the customer to “Let go! Let go! Let go!”. However as six McDonald’s workers franticly try to pull the man from their colleague, he appears to hit one of the mediating female employees over the head.

Sophie Hinchcliffe - known as Mrs Hinch - had no idea her tips would prove so popular and gain her hundreds of thousands of followers around the world. She has now sparked a frenzy of people stockpiling cleaning products to make their homes spotless - with some items selling out and going on eBay for triple the price. If you step inside Sophie\u0027s Essex house you will find immaculately clean floors, skirtings and worktops decorated in cool grey tones, reports Essex Live .  The 28-year-old hairdresser created her profile @MrsHinchHome_X_ in March when her now husband Jamie began to decorate the Maldon home they bought two years ago. However, it has only been since July that the number of followers sky rocketed when she started sharing her cleaning routines, and now she has more than 265,000 followers. It just spiralled and I couldn\u0027t be more grateful, she said. It started off as around 200 or 500 [followers] a month and now it\u0027s as many as 35,000 a day. It\u0027s in the last four to six weeks that it has gone viral. I\u0027ve got followers from Ireland, the US and Australia and they are all amazing.  Her dedicated following have started calling themselves \u0027Hinch Army\u0027, using #HinchArmy to share their own successes using some of Sophie\u0027s methods and recommended products. She believes that the success of the page is down to her being true to herself and sharing her love for having fun when cleaning. Sophie said: It\u0027s been overwhelming but amazing. People are sharing before and after photos of their homes and I\u0027m just so pleased my account has helped so many people together. I don\u0027t bombard cleaning on my grid page. It\u0027s mainly on my stories and my page then shows the results of fun cleaning, aka Hinching.  I name all my cloths and cleaning equipment, which may sound odd to some, but it is a laugh for us all and now everyone is getting involved. It\u0027s unbelievable. I\u0027m a worrier and I struggle with anxiety, she added. For me, to keep my mind off of what was worrying me would be to clean and organise something and love the end result. It took my mind off worrying. It helps me control my panic attacks too. Since I\u0027ve started the account others have messaged me saying I\u0027ve changed their lives and helped them with their mental health which to me is simply amazing. I get thousands of messages each day like this.  Sophie has even got her husband involved in her antics. Jamie is so supportive, she said. He is amazing. He gets involved too and I ask him to try and \u0027Hinch\u0027 the sinks. Everyone loves Mr Hinch and watching him too. Sophie shares the products she uses and what is in her cleaning \u0027baskets\u0027 and wants people to know that she does not clean all the time. Everyone seems to have caught the \u0027Hinch\u0027 bug, she said. They are wanting to try the products I love and it\u0027s great to see the army itself helping each other, complimenting each other and sharing tips.  But I don\u0027t clean constantly every day. As long as I clean for around 30 minutes or an hour each day I feel OK. I like to clean as and when something needs to be done. I clean for fun. My thing is the kitchen sink. The Hinch Army loves a shiny sink. She also maintains that you do not need to spend a fortune for sparkling results. I have many cleaning baskets, Sophie said. Consisting of a weekly basket and a daily one. I would say that organising my cleaning products is the biggest thing that I enjoy.  We all like to have our products in the right basket. I\u0027m also pine mad so I have to have pine products.  I shop in Poundstretcher and Poundland and B\u0026ampM for my items. I use things because they are cheap but they work well. I don\u0027t always go for the really expensive products. Now I\u0027ve shown my followers what I like to buy, I go into the shops and struggle to find my favourites as the shelves have been Hinch hauled. But it\u0027s so funny to see. Sophie is not planning on slowing down any time soon. Her account is now the second most influential home interior account on Instagram in the UK and she is excited to see where this could lead to.

She loved Christmas, and always wanted her sons to have a brilliant time. According to her former butler Paul Burrell, she would spend hours searching for the perfect stocking fillers for them. One year she got Prince Harry a very naughty gift - and he absolutely loved it.  Speaking to the Mirror, he said: She\u0027d spend hours looking for jokey things for their stockings. One year, Harry got fake dog poo. The young prince loved the present and had a very cheeky plan for it. According to Mr Burrell, he was going to trick his grandmother the Queen with it. We would have loved to see that!  Mr Burrell also revealed Diana, William and Harry\u0027s Saturday night routine , and it\u0027s unbelievably normal. He said: The three of them would nip to McDonald’s for a Big Mac and fries before coming back to watch Blind Date. All three of them would squat on this massive, stuffed hippopotamus Diana had in her sitting room.  They loved Blind Date and I’d hear them all screaming things like “Oh don’t pick him!” and “Lorra, lorra fun”. William and Harry also talk about pictures from two albums Diana made for each of them. It was her giving them the story of their lives in pictures and they have their names in gold lettering on the front. When they got married and had children of their own, she wanted them to show them – and I’m sure that’s what William is doing with George and Charlotte.

The cameras feature new LED infrared equipment and they look nothing like the traditional ones that drivers are used to seeing at the roadside. They face oncoming traffic and some motorists may not realise they are cameras at all. In addition to speeding, the equipment can catch drivers whoaren\u0027t wearing a seatbelt or are using their phone, eating, drinking or smoking when they\u0027re meant to be concentrating on the road, Devon Live reports.  The technology, part of the new Safety Camera Partnership, is meant to snare speeding drivers more effectively. A cluster of cameras has been set up along Gdynia Way, which leads into into Plymouth city centre in Devon. The cameras face oncoming traffic, while an accompanying LED box system is positioned 20 yards before them. How do average speed cameras work?  The multiple cameras  are set at separate locations along a stretch of road  and are synchronised to record the exact time that each car passes using number plate reading technology. Then a computer will work out the average speed between the cameras to determine if the car was over the speed limit. Some people wrongly think that each camera records a driver\u0027s speed as they pass each camera before the computer works out the average speed as the car passed every camera - this explains why some drivers think they can speed up between the cameras and slow down as they pass them. But doing this is likely to land you with a fine - the cameras simply record the time you pass them and the computer works out how long it has taken you to pass the distance between them. Do the cameras work at night?  Yes. They are fitted with infra red illuminators to ensure they work night and day, and all weathers. Can the cameras run out of film? No. Unlike some other speed cameras, average speed camera information is saved to a computer. Can the cameras catch motorbikes? Yes. The cameras are equipped to capture all types of vehicles. If a vehicle changes lanes will they avoid any fines? No. The cameras calculate for lane changes. But this myth can mean people dangerously switch lanes increasing the chance of crashes.

Hurricane Helene is currently in the Atlantic Ocean, following the trail of Florence, which is about to make landfall on the east coast of America. Officials in the Carolinas urged people to evacuate the coast ahead of the storm\u0027s expected pounding winds and rain-driven floods. Florence weakened slightly to a Category 3 storm on a five-step scale but had maximum sustained winds of 125 miles per hour  as of 2pm EDT , down from 130mph earlier in the day. According to the latest trajectory, the centre will most likely strike the southern coast of North Carolina by late Thursday or early Friday, the National Hurricane Center  said.  Isaac, a smaller hurricane, is headed for the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to grow stronger over the next day or two, according to forecasters. But Helene looks set to U-turn at the end of the week, swirling northeast towards the UK. Helene is forecast to gradually weaken over the next couple of days and may become a tropical storm on Thursday, according to the NHC. Helene was located about 1,285 miles south-southwest of the Azores in the Atlantic with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour on Wednesday.  Met Office meteorologist Emma Smith said: “There is a chance Helene will be caught up in the jet stream and that would bring some wet and windy weather to the UK after the weekend. “However this will depend on the conditions around the UK at the time of arrival, it could end up strengthening high pressure emphasising drier conditions.”  But the hurricane\u0027s approach to Britain might not be bad news, as the remnants could heat up the already warm conditions expected next week. Smith added: “There is a chance the southeast could turn very warm next week and this could be another effect of the remnants of Helene. “Already we expect temperatures in the region to be higher than average for the time of year due to the direction of airflow bringing warmer air in from the Atlantic. “Air associated with Helene could end up being caught up with this bringing even warmer conditions.”   Meanwhile, the national forecaster yesterday revealed its list of storm names for 2018 to 2019 .  The next severe weather will be named Storm Ali to reflect our “diversity”. This is the fourth year the government weather services of Britain and Ireland have combined to name disruptive systems. But this is the first time \u0026shyofficials have added names to improve race relations. A Met Office spokesman said: “This season’s names have been compiled from a list submitted by the public... selecting names that reflect the nations, culture and diversity.” The list of 21 includes Storm Idris which may be a nod to actor Idris Elba.

Hollie-Louise Brown has shared photos of her horrific injuries and admits she can barely look at herself in the mirror anymore. The 23-year-old says she thought she was going to die in the attack while out for a drink in Northumberland on Saturday night. She claims she was left unconscious on the nightclub floor. Her attackers allegedly scratched at her eyeballs and kicked her in the head, while she could \u0027hear the hair tearing from her scalp\u0027.  The telesales worker was left half bald and covered in cuts, bruises and cigarette burns. She feared she would not \u0027make it home to her children\u0027 during her 25-minute ordeal and later needed a CT scan to check for brain damage. Kind-hearted pals launched a fundraising page to help raise cash for hair treatment which has now raised \u0026pound1,250 - almost three times its initial target. Hollie-Louise, from Choppington, Northumberland, said: I\u0027m still in a lot of shock. I just can\u0027t stop sobbing every time I walk past the mirror. I\u0027m absolutely heartbroken at the state of myself. The attack was unprovoked and there was no reason for it. I didn\u0027t think it was ever going to stop. I could hear my hair being ripped out.  I wondered if I was going to make it home to my children or if I\u0027d even get to see them again. Hollie-Louise had been to Bubbles pub in Ashington, Northumberland, on Saturday night when she was allegedly attacked at around 1am. The single mum claims the incident started when a woman began dancing around her and \u0027bumping\u0027 into her. When Hollie-Louise confronted her, the woman allegedly leaped on her - while her friends tore at her hair. After falling to the floor, Hollie-Louise claims she was strangled and kicked to the head and body in a sustained attack that lasted around 25 minutes. Meanwhile, other women allegedly scratched at her eyes after someone shouted \u0027gouge out her eyes\u0027 from the sideline. Hollie-Louise claimed: She was bouncing around the dance floor and bumping into me on purpose. I asked her what she was doing and she pushed me.  I grabbed her and then all her friends began pulling at my hair and kicking me. We were rolling around the floor and they were all pulling at my hair. One of them was strangling me... I\u0027m almost bald now. By the time the attack had ended I didn\u0027t really know what was going on. One put my fingers in her mouth and was trying to bite. I was kicked in the head repeatedly. She added: My eyelashes are gone because of where they tried to scratch my eyeballs. It went on for ages - it was probably about 25 minutes. According to my friends I ended up unconscious on the floor.  After coming round, Hollie-Louise rushed home to her two sons, admitting she feared she\u0027d never see them again. Her dad helped her report it to the police and the next day she attended hospital and saw the police forensics team, who she claims confirmed that a cigarette had been deliberately put out on her. During the days following the incident, the mum\u0027s bruises reportedly worsened and she now fears the women will return. Hollie-Louise said: I went straight home because my dad was babysitting at my house and I needed to get back to my children. When I got in at around 1.45am, they were both awake when I got in and my oldest is only three, but he looked at me in shock because I looked so different. Obviously I was really upset and my hair had been pulled out.  I went to the forensic team at the police station. They confirmed they\u0027d put a cigarette out on me and I had scratches and bruises all over my body. My injuries have actually got worse since then because the bruising has come out.

Revolve has been hit with a wave of backlash after a grey jumper emblazoned with the slogan \u0027Being fat is not beautiful, it\u0027s an excuse\u0027 appeared on its website. Shoppers also slammed the brand for using a \u0027skinny model\u0027 to promote the garment, along with other jumpers which said: \u0027Too boney to be boned\u0027 and \u0027sl*t feminist nightmare\u0027. But Revolve has since explained there has been a misunderstanding and that the jumpers are ironically supposed to raise awareness about online trolls, but went online prematurely without proper context.  However, customers were outrage at the clothing, with one saying: This is gross..who even thought that would be a good idea? Twitter user Lauren added: I normally don’t get offended by the fat title or shaming. However, this shirt sends the wrong message to people who are struggling with this. We should be teaching them every size is beautiful. And a woman called Victoria fumed: They didn’t think this one through. Nice to constantly have companies body shaming! It’s bad enough as it is with people having eating disorders because of pressure online and in the media.  Meanwhile, plus-size model Tess Holliday, who appeared on the front cover of Cosmo in a green swimsuit to promote body confidence, tweeted a picture of the jumper and said: LOLLLLL @REVOLVE y’all are a mess.    Florence Givens, an artist and social issued advocate, first posted a series of pictures from the Revolve website on her Instagram account of models wearing sweaters with the controversial quotes.  At the end of each quote in small font there was a \u0027as said to \u0027 line to highlight the phrases specific people encountered in their own life. The women who provided the troll quotes were celebs Lena Dunham, Emily Ratajkowski, Cara Delevingne, Suki Waterhouse and Paloma Elsesser. LPA, the brand who collaborated with Revolve for the jumpers, explained in a message chain that the collection was rolled out earlier than intended without the meaning behind it.  In a statement Revolve said: The capsule collection – originally conceived by LPA alongside Lena Dunham, Emily Ratajkowski, Cara Delevingne, Suki Waterhouse and Paloma Elsesser – was set to debut tomorrow as a direct commentary on the modern day \u0027normality\u0027 of cyber-bullying and the shared desire to create a community for those most affected by the epidemic. Proceeds were set to benefit \u0027Girls Write Now\u0027, a charity focused on mentoring underserved young women and helping them find their voices and tell their stories through writing.

Pyotr Verzilov, a vocal critic of Russian President Vladimr Putin, fell into a coma after on Tuesday evening and was rushed to hospital. Doctors have allegedly refused to give details of the 30-year-old\u0027s condition to family and girlfriend. His former partner and prominent Pussy Riot campaigner Nadezhdka Tolokonnikova, 28, tweeted: Petya  is in intensive care, probably poisoned. In the toxicology department in a very bad state.” Maria Alyokhina, 30, jailed with Tolokonnikova for an anti-Putin stunt run a Moscow cathedral, said: “Petya is in intensive care in bad state, it is kind of hell…”  “From 8 to 10 pm he was gradually getting worse. At first it was about his eyesight, then speech, then ability to walk straight”, said Nikulshina. Respected Moscow journalist Alexey Venediktov posted: ”Verzilov is in intensive care. “Nobody is allowed to see him.” Verzilov - who also Canadian as well as Russian citizenship - became ill after attending a court hearing and has been in hospital for two days but his condition was only disclosed over overnight.  He is being treated by toxicology specialists at Bakhrushin City Clinical hospital in Moscow. His 21-year-old girlfriend Veronika ‘Nika’ Nikulshina called for medical help after he went into “convulsions” and became “delirious” on Tuesday. Nikulshina, an economic student, model and protester, said Verzilov became ill after seeing friends following a court hearing into a case against her. He complained of tiredness and became nervous and anxious, she said. “When the ambulance arrived, he answered their questions and said no to everything – he did not eat anything, he did not take any medicine.  “He was quickly getting worse, he had convulsions. “On the way to the ambulance he started to rave. “He was in a kind of semi-conscious condition, he stopped recognising me.” He was moved to the toxicology department but doctors refused to explain anything to Nikulshina on poisoning because “the status of a girlfriend does not give me any rights”. She was told only that his condition was “grave” . But Verzilov’s mother was also blocked from seeing her son. “She was told that they were not allowed to disclose any information,” said a relative. “They were rude and sent her away. “They said they could not let her in.

Believe it or not, many classic and well-loved children’s books have also been slapped with bans around the world for seemingly inappropriate content and messages. Roald Dahl has previously been named the best storyteller of all time - but even one of his best known children\u0027s novels was outlawed. Here, multi-award-winning children’s author Julie Hodgson, whose sci-fi adventure novel Jodie and the Library Card is set in a future world where all printed books are banned, reveals the top five children’s books that have been outlawed for surprising reasons. Where’s Wally by Martin Handford  Known in America as ‘Where’s Waldo’, this entertaining and beloved picture book has kept generations of kids busy for hours trying to find the distinctive stripy protagonist amid a huge crowd within densely-drawn illustrations.  Children in the USA, however, had little chance of spotting Wally after the book was banned from inclusion in many of the country’s libraries between 1990 and 2000. The reason for this was down to a little cartoon nudity thrown in by British author and illustrator Martin Handford. Eagle-eyed viewers spotted a sunbathing woman showing a side view of a bare breast in the top right-hand corner of the “On the Beach” scene. In later editions, the artwork was amended by giving the woman a bikini top. Similarly, in “The Campsite” scene, a man can be seen undressing in a tent. In the original he is clearly naked, though his genitals are covered by his hand. This was still too much for censors, however, and in the 1997 special release he is wearing white briefs. Winnie the Pooh by AA Milne  It may be one of Britain’s most enduring children’s books, featuring a hapless bear and his little friend piglet, but Winnie the Pooh was heavily criticised in Poland for promoting “dubious sexuality”. While the book itself was not banned, councillors in Tuszyn, central Poland, refused to consider Pooh a suitable mascot for their town’s new playground because he wore a top but no trousers.  They described him as “inappropriately dressed and half-naked”, with one councillor even going so far as to label the character a “hermaphrodite”, and attacked author AA Milne for being “disturbing”. Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll  The crazy world of Alice in Wonderland has made it a firm favourite for over a century, spawning many films and TV adaptations along the way. In China, though, the book was banned for the crime of depicting talking animals. The governor of China’s Hunan province argued that animals shouldn’t speak and feared that it would elevate animals to the same level as humans, with disastrous consequences.  Later, in 1990, the book was also banned in some parts of America, this time for being subversive, containing expletives and sexual content and promoting derogatory characterisations of teachers and religious ceremonies. Some also said it contained drug references, such as in chapter five, when Alice meets a caterpillar that is sitting atop a mushroom. Green Eggs and Ham by Dr Seuss  Dr Seuss, the pen name of American author Theodor Seuss Geisel, may be renowned for his quirky, nonsensical writing but, in 1965, China again took exception to his book Green Eggs and Ham – banning the story of a fussy eater for promoting “early Marxism”. The problem was that the character Sam-I-am owned his own eggs, which was against the Chinese ideology of the government owning everything. The ban was not lifted until the author’s death in 1991. The book was also banned in California because of Sam-I-Am’s apparent homosexual seduction of the protagonist. Another of Dr. Seuss’ books, the Lorax, was also banned in California in the late eighties, this time because it was believed to portray logging in a poor light and would “turn children against the foresting industry”. The Witches by Roald Dahl  Despite Roald Dahl repeatedly denying he was a misogynist, and writing many brilliant female characters , his 1983 book The Witches was banned in some UK libraries for its negative portrayal of women. Critics considered the book sexist because the author declared that only women could be witches, with one stating it would encourage boys to grow-up to become “men who hate women”.  The book also appears on the American Library Association’s list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990 to 1999, placed at number 22.

The discovery, made up of a long series of \u0027sinister-looking\u0027 structures, has sparked speculation and conspiracy theories. Spanning more than a mile, it was spotted by an online paranormal investigator, known as \u0027Conspiracy Depot\u0027 on Google Earth. He said: “I assume they are related to some man-made activities for research purposes. But I’ve looked at the co-ordinates and I’ve looked on a number of sites for all known research stations in Antarctica and the closest one is Norwegian station 200 miles away.”  One viewer guessed the discovery is a nuclear bunker for the world’s rich and powerful elite, the Express reports. While another speculated it is a landing pad for aliens. The area deep inside Antarctica appears to be covered in vehicle tracks, and it also looks like there\u0027s an airstrip. Another paranormal investigator, Florida Maquis, added to the intrigue by claiming the mystery structure remains visible in sightings going back to 2001.

I think it might be good for both of us.”While Kamara has remained in Scotland this week for treatment, Kallman is off on international duty, though not with the full squad.But while, after winning his first full cap earlier this year, he appears to be dropping a level as he joins the U/21 squad for two vital Euro qualifiers, he’s happy.The 20-year-old is very much of the opinion that his near-certain involvement against Denmark and Poland will be a case of taking one step back to make two forward.The Dens loan signing from Turku doesn’t hide from the fact he would love to have competed at the higher level.For him, though, time on the park is what matters most and that’s why he’s more than happy to be representing his country in the younger age group.“Of course you always want to go forward and I heard back in Finland they were looking to put new players into the team and the manager said I was one of the options,” he said.“However, then again you have to think about that. Now I am in the U/21s and we have two qualifier games.“I’ve played with them all the time and am going to play as the first striker for them. You have to know which are the best moments to go to the first team because, if I go to the U/21s, I’ll get playing time and we have two games to try to qualify with them.“For that reason I think it might be better to be with the U/21s to get playing time. If I got called up to the first team, yes, I would be there but how much playing time will I get, I don’t know.“It’s easier to say afterwards because you don’t know how much time you will get but with the U/21s I know I am guaranteed playing time.”And the benefit to Dundee of his trip back to the continent should be the competitive nature of the action he sees.Not only are the opposition he’ll face of a decent standard, there’s plenty of stake in the fixtures.If the young Finns can win both, they would still be in with a chance of qualifying for the Euro finals, though the history of the group so far does suggest they will have their work cut out.When they faced the Danes at home last year they were on the wrong end of a 5-0 drubbing, so to beat them in the away tie will be a big ask.Kallman, though, is up for the challenge and is determined to do all his can to at least extend Finnish interest in qualification.“These will be a tough two games. They are the deciders for us because teams are four and five points ahead of us in the table with Poland first and Denmark second.“We have to at least not lose these game to still have a chance to proceed.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"craig easton sees irn bru as a chance for dundee united kids to get their fizz back","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United reserve team boss Craig Easton believes Saturday’s Irn-Bru Cup clash with Alloa will be the perfect test for his young team.The Tangerines second string were on the wrong end of a 5-1 score in the Reserve League at Hearts on Monday.But Craig believes the margin of the home team’s victory was not a fair reflection on his side’s play and is viewing the weekend tie as a chance to show that.“We are looking forward to the game even though it comes on the back of what wasn’t a good result for us against Hearts,” he said.“It wasn’t a 5-1 performance, though. We missed two penalties and we were always in the game until the last two goals went in later in the second half.“So, I think the score was harsh on us in the end but you still don’t want to lose five goals in any game and you want to defend better.”Looking forward, he suspects Alloa will not be much changed from the side that drew with United in the Championship last weekend“I think they don’t have a massive squad so it could be similar to the league game against us on Saturday. They are a good, fit and organised outfit. It will be a hard game.”As was the case in the first-round victory over St Johnstone Colts last month, the United ranks at Tannadice on Saturday are likely to be bolstered by several first-team men.And young midfielder Archie Thomas is back in contention for a starting place.He was injured in the first minute of the first-round victory but returned for half an hour of Monday’s game.United have set the entry price for Saturday’s game at £10.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united pair fyvie and king continue on their road to recovery","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United pair Fraser Fyvie and Billy King continued their comebacks from injury in the Reserve League Cup on Tuesday.The two made their first appearances of the season in the Irn-Bru Cup defeat against Alloa at the weekend.After coming on late on against the Wasps, this time club captain Fyvie and winger King were both given the full first half.That puts them well down the road to a first-team return, though it would be a major surprise if either were to feature in Saturday’s Championship clash with Morton at Tannadice.After being out since Christmas, Fyvie, in particular, is likely to continue his build-up in the reserves for another couple of weeks.The plan for him is to have him back only once he’s completed a full game for the second string.Their presence saw them help the Tangerines to a 2-1 win over Saints, though both United goals came late in the second period.Matty Smith, with his second goal in two games, levelled after Saints had gone ahead through Jordan Northcott.United then sealed the points from the opening group game when Louis Appere struck 18 minutes from the end.United, meanwhile, have switched their crucial Championship clash at Partick Thistle next month.The game was originally scheduled for Tuesday, October 30, but with both teams’ interest in this season’s Irn-Bru at an end, they’ve brought it forward to Saturday, October 13, with a 3pm kick-off.As well as suiting fans, it means both teams will avoid a three-game week at the end of the month.Had United progressed in the Irn-Bru they would have faced Dunfermline in the third round.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/V_A-Dundee_Scotland_©HuftonCrow_082-588x564.jpg ","title":"french journalist says dundee is very well known due to va as media from across the world visit city","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe eyes of the world will be on Dundee for the next few days, as the V\u0026ampA finally opens the doors to its new £80 million design museum on the city’s Waterfront.After months of anticipation fuelled by teaser images, artists’ impressions and 3D fly-through videos, the media was given its first look at the inside of Kengo Kuma’s distinctive structure.Journalists and television crews from across the globe were are all in Dundee for the great unveiling.The V\u0026ampA’s tourism officer Alice Kennedy said journalists from China, Japan, Canada, America, France, Spain and Germany were due to visit the museum over the next few days.Alice said: “We expected media interest from all over the world but this is exceeding our expectations.\u0026nbsp“Foreign journalists here will be spreading the word about the museum across the globe.“There is a huge interest in the museum and in Dundee as a result. 100vw, 588px\" /“We are confident this will help to bring thousands of visitors to the city.”Hiroyuki Kikko from Nippon Television in Tokyo said interest in the museum went beyond the fact it was built by a Japanese architect.He said: “We’re here because of Kengo Kuma’s involvement and we want to announce the museum to Japanese people.“We hope our broadcasts will encourage Japanese visitors to come to Dundee.“This museum has captured global interest. That’s why we’re here.”Tristan De Bourbon Parme from Le Journal des Arts in Paris said the museum had surpassed expectations.“There was a perception that it would be an extension of the V\u0026ampA in London but now I understand that is not the case, and that this is a significant museum in its own right,” he said.“I’m sure this is going to draw visitors from all over the world.“It is an amazing asset for Dundee to have. It will surely become a major tourist attraction and I can definitely see people from France coming to visit.“Dundee has become very well known on the international stage recently and there’s no doubt the museum has played a major part in that.“I’ve been in Dundee a couple of times before and each time I come I see another change and development.”If the shape of the outside of the museum is difficult for people to get their heads around, the inside is even more mind-boggling.The walls are lined with wood panels, in stark contrast to the concrete exterior, and the floor is made of Irish limestone.There are thousands of fossilised remains set in the stone, in a further nod to Kuma’s love of the natural world. 100vw, 580px\" /But just like the outside, the interior building twists and turns as you walk through it, with not one straight wall in sight.As you make your way from the entrance, which is virtually hidden at the far end of the building, into the main reception area, the building opens up – and a grand staircase takes you up to the vast exhibition spaces.Speaking at the unveiling of his masterpiece, Kuma said: “I am truly in love with the Scottish landscape and nature – I was inspired by the cliffs of north east Scotland.“I hope the museum can change the city and become its centre of gravity.”Dundee City Council leader John Alexander said: “This building has made a significant impact on Dundee even before it has opened.“It signifies a renewed confidence, a renewed pride and a fire in the belly.“For too long our city has been seen as a poor relation but that is changing.“The people of Dundee have bought into the cultural led regeneration and they see this building as theirs.”Following the visits by journalists, a select group of people – who won competitions run by DC Thomson, including the Evening  – will become the first members of the public to get inside the museum on Friday for an exclusive tour.Then on Saturday the building opens up fully, with those who were successful in securing tickets becoming the first official visitors to the attraction.Sunday is also ticket-only, before the free-to-enter museum begins normal operations on Monday – though visitors will have to pay for certain exhibitions.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"i was looking to see if i could go elsewhere ex celtic kid paul mcmullan back from the brink at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWinger Paul McMullan has revealed there was a real chance of him leaving Dundee United before the transfer window closed a week ago.And the former Scotland U/21 international can’t rule out being on the move when the next window opens in January.However, between now and then, the former Celtic kid, who was brought to Tannadice by Ray McKinnon before the start of last season, insists his only focus will be on winning back a regular first-team place.That fight will continue in today’s Irn-Bru Cup second-round clash with Alloa, a game McMullan concedes he might not have been involved in.“The speculation last week, it was true. I was having a look to see if I could go elsewhere because the playing time here has been limited,” he said.“In the end there wasn’t anything that I felt attracted me more than Dundee United did, so that’s why I’m still here.“The club had made it pretty clear to me that, if I wanted to move on, they weren’t going to stand in my way, they’d let me go.“Between now and January I’ve got to get my head down and try to get time on the park.“And when it comes to January I will re-evaluate because I will only have six months on my contract left. I will have to look at it.“Right now, though, I’m just doing my best to try to get back into the team and see how that works. I’m not looking at anything else, I’m just focused on getting in the team and contributing.”With that in mind he is not looking at tomorrow and the Irn-Bru Cup, a competition United have made clear is not a priority this term, with any sense of disdain.He sees it as another chance to show manager Csaba Laszlo, who’s likely to be watching from the stand as reserve manager Craig Easton takes charge of the team, he should be in the starting line-up every week.For fans turning up, history suggests McMullan’s presence could mean they will be in for another late show.When the teams met at the same stage this time last year, he and Willo Flood struck deep in injury time to earn United victory.And in the first round this season, it was McMullan’s last-gasp strike that secured a remarkable comeback win over St Johnstone Colts, who’d been two up late on. This time he’d settle for the winner to come a little earlier than that.“I’ve done that a couple of times with late goals in this cup,” he added.“Hopefully, we don’t leave it until that late again and the boys can do well and get into the next round.“It would be nice to have a more straightforward victory but it is going to be a hard game and we saw at the weekend how tough it is playing against Alloa.“We just have to take it as it comes and see how we get on.”With Alloa expected to be along the same lines as when they lined up against United in the Championship last Saturday, McMullan knows making the third round could be a big ask.“I wouldn’t think they will make too many changes but it’s an opportunity for us to show what we do and we will try to take it.“It will be a good learning process for the younger ones in our team and a good test against seasoned pros who know what the game is all about.“For me, it’s an opportunity to show what I can do and that’s what I have to keep on doing.“I feel I’ve done OK, it’s just the chances haven’t been there for one reason or another and there’s not a lot I can do about that.“All I can do is stay patient and, if an opportunity comes, do all you can to make sure I take it as best I can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b80270a0c53e-846x564.jpg ","title":"new peoples piano installed at dundee station thanks to fundraiser","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe generosity of Dundonians has been hailed after a new \u0026#8216People\u0026#8217s Piano\u0026#8217 was installed at the city\u0026#8217s rail station.It comes after the original piano, which was donated by Dundee man David Patterson to honour his late wife and Scotrail worker Jean, was vandalised by yobs.Mr Paterson\u0026#8217s idea was to place the piano in the station to allow anyone to sit down and play a tune for fellow travellers.Local man Greg Joiner quickly set up an online crowdfunding page to replace the piano.

irn bru cup","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Irn-Bru Cup might not matter to Dundee United but Saturday’s second-round clash with Alloa at Tannadice might just prove to be one of the most significant days in their season.Craig Easton’s mix of kids and fringe players showed guts and character but just fell short as they lost the lead late on before exiting on penalties.As was signalled by less than 1,000 home fans turning up, however, few connected with the Tangerines will be bothered about that.What was both important and a massive positive, was the sight of club captain Fraser Fyvie making his long-awaited return from injury.Fyvie hadn’t been seen on Tannadice since two days before Christmas when a serious knee injury ended his season.Given the difference in results with and without him last term, it could be strongly argued the minute he went down clutching his knee also effectively killed off the campaign for the team as a whole.Now he’s back, manager Csaba Laszlo will be hoping he has the same influence as during his opening months at the club.Encouraging as the sight of him running on was, he will, of course, still need time to get up to speed in terms of match sharpness.Accordingly, the plan is for a few reserve outings to build strength and stamina before he returns to the full first team for the all- important Championship action.For Laszlo and the fans that time can’t come soon enough but those who turned up on Saturday were at least given glimpses of just how much he has to offer.There were a couple of passes from deep that turned defence into attack in an instant and a thunderous free-kick that provided the final action of game time and would have seen his return capped with a dramatic winner had it not be for a fine save from Neil Parry in the Alloa goal.Indeed, in a strange 90 minutes that saw the visitors dominate possession at times, but for Parry, Easton could have been looking forward to the third round.Over the piece, Alloa did more of the attacking but lacked the quality up front to finish off the good approach work.Often hitting on the break, United were able to create clear chances but found Parry in top form.After a crisp Matty Smith strike had given United the lead against the run of play on 15 minutes, Parry was soon denying the same player with an excellent stop, though somehow Greg Aitken failed to spot his touch and awarded a goal kick.Parry’s ability was recognised before the interval when he then made a superb stop to touch a Paul McMullan free-kick round the post.And he was the hero in the opening minutes of the second period as he plucked a Declan Glass 18-yarder out of the air, then did very well to beat away an Archie Thomas strike.For all that, Alloa continued to look a threat and when they were finally given a clear chance, from the penalty spot, Alan Trouten made no mistake, sending the ball past Benjamin Siegrist for the equaliser.If Jim Goodwin’s team fancied their chances of going on to get a winner in 90 minutes, they had further cause to be grateful to their goalkeeper as he denied Thomas and Fyvie in injury time to take the tie to a penalty shootout.It saw nine of the 10 spot-kicks expertly despatched via the use of power, only for the otherwise excellent Thomas opting for placement instead, giving Parry his most routine stop.It was the deciding moment, but for once a defeat included a bigger positive than the negative of losing.That came on 70 minutes when Fyvie strode out on the pitch.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b9787de217c4-846x564.jpg ","title":"va dundee opening weekend stomping start to 3d

alongside a cast of nine professional contemporary dancers and three guest dancers from Scottish Ballet.Rehearsals for the specially commissioned performance, part of the 3D Festival, have been taking place at Dundee and Angus College and the University of Dundee’s playing fields. About 250 of the performers gathered at the playing fields to practise and to give people a taste of what’s to come.The event is choreographed by Thomas Small, the artistic director of Shaper/Caper and 70 of the dancers are training at the Scottish School of Contemporary Dance: D\u0026ampA College.Thomas said: “The pure energy of the performance is so exhilarating and we cannot wait to showcase what we’ve spent months developing.“This has been the craziest and largest jigsaw to bring together but we can promise it will be nothing short of spectacular on the night.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b98d992afff4-417x564.jpg ","title":"wins can have dundee united ready to host the teams from the north","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs the early-season jockeying for position continues in a Championship that’s, so far, living up to predictions it will be the tightest for years, Dundee United can do themselves a lot of good by winning their next two games.Even if the last league outing ended in the minor disappointment of a draw at Alloa, there’s no denying, since their early-campaign troubles in the Betfred Cup, the past few weeks have seen the Tangerines show steady signs of improvement.The last three outings have produced two wins plus that draw and, in a division where after just four rounds of fixtures only one team, Inverness Caley Thistle, remains unbeaten, that can be put down as a decent run of form.And, if United can extend that to five games without loss via victories over Morton at Tannadice this Saturday and at Falkirk a week later, there’s every chance they’ll be the form team in the second tier.If that is so, it would be a case of good timing because at least two of the three games that will follow could prove to be among the most crucial of the campaign.That run will see them come up against both Inverness and Ross County and, as tight as the table looks just now, it is significant the Highland pair currently occupy the top two positions.Coming down from the Premiership and with the backing of mega-rich owner Roy McGregor, County were always expected to mount a strong challenge to return to the top flight.It’s been a case of so far so good, though they did go down 2-1 at Morton last time out in the league.And before arriving at Tannadice on the 29th of this month, their quality will be further tested by a visit to in-form Queen of the South this weekend and a derby against Inverness the following week.That the team from the Highland capital are also looking strong will come as no surprise to those who know the Championship.Although they didn’t even make the promotion play-offs last term, many at that level felt between Christmas and the end of the season Caley were the strongest of the 10 teams.They’re coming to Tannadice in just over a month, almost exactly a year to the day since their impressive victory would mark the end of Ray McKinnon’s time in charge of the home team. While a win for Caley this time is unlikely to produce the same course of events with current United boss Csaba Laszlo, it would be a major blow to his hopes of guiding the team to promotion.Sandwiched between those encounters with the teams from the far north, will be a trip to Ayr United and old boss Ian McCall.Long since recovered from a difficult period at Tannadice, over the past three years he’s worked wonders at Somerset Park, twice winning promotion to this level.His team were on fire at the start of the season, most notably when they headed for Dens Park in the Betfred Cup and destroyed Dundee 3-0.The Honest Men’s last league outing saw them come back down to earth with a bump as they crashed at Queen of the South in a 5-0 beating that included a 10-minute first-half hat-trick from Steven Dobbie.Over the next couple of weeks, it will be interesting to see if that was no more than a blip or an indication Ayr have been punching above their weight so far and, over the course of the season, will settle into their expected role of simply battling to stay in the division.Whichever is the case, United will not expect anything they bring home from the southwest to come easy but, if it’s part of a haul of points from an extended good run, it will bode well for the remainder of the season.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/CITY-CIRCLE-360-map-1808-FINAL2-1-1-564x564.jpg ","title":"xplore dundee takes leap of faith with launch of new service that stops off at all city centre attractions","story":"\t\t\t\t\tLocal bus firm Xplore Dundee is ready to take a “leap of faith” next week when it launches a new city centre service on a three-month trial.The 360 City Circle bus will link all of the centre\u0026#8217s tourist attractions in a single 20-minute route, connecting the bus and train stations along the way.Christine McGlasson, managing director of Xplore, said the firm was stepping into the unknown with the new route.But she hopes tourists and locals alike will embrace the service during its trial run.“This is the right time to run a service like this,” said Christine.“We want to help people get around the city centre easily and folk have been calling out for a service like this for years.“It really is a leap of faith though – we’re just taking a chance on something we think people will use.“And if ever there was a time to try it out, it’s now.“Hopefully, we can get make a big success of it – we need people to get on board for that.”Xplore has secured the loan of a £220,000 demonstrator bus from Northern Irish firm Wrightbus for the three-month trial.Tourists boarding the bus – which has eye-catching electric green livery featuring graphics of city landmarks – can pick up a brochure showing them the full route, as well as links to other services to places further afield, such as Broughty Ferry.The all-electric bus can operate all day without having to be charged, running from 8am-5.30pm at a fixed price of £3 for adults and £2 for children.Should the trial be considered a success, Xplore hopes to either extend its lease of the bus or find money to buy one of its own.Christine added: “The fact is there is a need for this service.“If it is successful, then brilliant – but if need be, we will look into subsidies such as low emission grants and tourism grants to keep it going.“It will all depend on how people use it.“We’re looking into things such as a recording played over the speakers telling people about their next stops, and tying it into tickets like Plusbus, which you can buy when you buy a train ticket to Dundee.“It’s trying to cater for all – local people to give them the connectivity, and people coming in to discover the city.”The Tele joined the 360’s inaugural run around the 2.65-mile route, taking in the Waterfront, Overgate, Verdant Works, McManus and Foxlake.The eco-friendly bus – which can recapture energy lost during braking to keep the battery charged – is zero-emission, apart from a tiny diesel generator used to heat the interior.Among the passengers on the City Circle’s first run were city council development chief Mike Galloway, North East Labour MSP Jenny Marra and local B\u0026ampB owners Barrie and Olwyn Jack. Mr Galloway said: “With the Waterfront coming to fruition and becoming a reality, a service linking everything together is another piece in the puzzle.“I hope it is really successful and does well.”Ms Marra said: “I think it’s great – the more public transport in Dundee the better it is for getting around.“It’s also really important that they’re using an economical bus. It’s great for the environment and I would like to see even more environmentally-friendly buses in the area.”Barrie and Olwyn, who run Duntrune House north of the city, say they think the 360 is a “great idea”.Olwyn added: “It’s excellent for people who come into Dundee that don’t have their bearings, linking everything up.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s

Scott will be a welcome addition to the squad when he comes back.”Dons boss Derek McInnes recently reaffirmed his belief that McKenna will eventually go for a “big ticket” move to the English Premier League.Lewis, a former England squad call-up, is also convinced the centre-back will ultimately move to the top flight south of the border.But first Lewis reckons the defender can continue to develop his game further at Pittodrie.He said: “Scott is a fantastic player and there is no surprise that teams are linked with him. He is English Premier League quality, definitely.“However he is a level-headed lad and knows he still has a lot of learning to do still.“I am sure he will continue to develop.“Playing first-team football here week in, week out will only help that as well.“Scott is a great player and we are very lucky to have him.“The longer we can keep him here the better it is for us. It was great to see we have knocked back that bid and hopefully we can keep him for as long as we can.” Aberdeen also rejected three bids from Championship Hull City for McKenna during the January transfer window, with the final offer in excess of £1 million.Lewis, 30, reckons it is not only his footballing attributes that can pave a way to the richest league in world football, but also McKenna’s attitude.He said: “What you see on the pitch is Scott’s physicality and his technical attributes.“He is great in the air, he is strong and quick. Everyone can see that.“However, he also has the perfect mentality to go right to the top.”Being targeted by clubs and the possibility of big money moves, then having them rejected, could possibly affect a player’s focus.Not McKenna. Lewis insists nothing has changed with the defender.He said: “What we see from training and playing with Scott day in, day out is that he has not changed at all.“His mindset has not changed. He still works hard.”Such is McKenna’s rising reputation, it has become a matter of when, not if, he will flit from Pittodrie in a big-money move.Boss McInnes recently admitted that could be as early as the January window if the price is right and there is enough time to replace him.Is the speculation about McKenna’s future and clubs’ bids a subject of discussion in the dressing room?“The lads will have a laugh and joke about it but no one gets sidetracked by anything like that,” explained Lewis.“The most important person in that scenario is Scott – and nothing will faze Scott. He is a great professional and will give 100% whoever he plays for – whether that is Scotland or Aberdeen.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen man accused of embezzling 13000 from supermarket","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA man has denied embezzling more than £13,000 while store manager of an Aberdeen shop.Darren Watt appeared yesterday at Aberdeen Sheriff Court in relation to the allegations at the Co-operative store on Sclattie Park, Bucksburn.The 40-year-old, whose address was given in court papers as Cloverfield Court, Bucksburn, faced a charge of embezzling goods worth £1,636 and £13,500 in money from the store while employed as the manager.The case will next call in November.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"community leaders welcome bid to restore post office service in aberdeen","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn application has been lodged to reopen an Aberdeen community\u0026#8217s post office.Woodside Post Office was closed three years ago but now Sal Ahmad, who runs Berryden Post Office with her husband Zulfiquar, is interested in reopening the branch.She said: “You can tell something is missing when you drive past where the post office used to be.“We would love to bring our award-winning customer service to Woodside and we hope to have it up and running by Christmas.”A Post Office spokeswoman said: “We have an interested applicant to re-open Woodside Post Office.“We are progressing their application so we are unable to comment further at the moment.“We are committed to restoring Post Office service to this area of Aberdeen, as we know how important this service is to the community.”Chairwoman of Woodside Community Council Charlene Kilpatrick was pleased to see the process moving forward.She said: “It will be great to have the service back in the heart of the community on Great Northern Road again and it might help to regenerate the street.”Mark McDonald MSP, who represents the Aberdeen Donside constituency, said: “It would be great for Woodside to get its post office back.“I know many residents were concerned when the service was lost, and a lot of people in the area would benefit from having it restored.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"group thanks firm for bus","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen charity for people with learning disabilities has thanked a firm for helping users during the summer holidays.Archway, based in the Granite City, received £20,000 from Nexen to help fund a wheelchair-adapted minibus.It now being used at Dyce Respite Unit, supporting 60 children and adults.Anne Marie Woodside, manager at Archway Dyce, said: “We can’t thank Nexen enough for their generosity and for helping us to take part in activities.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/09/5b9a004372b76-752x564.jpg ","title":"map these are the 48 buildings across the north east taking part in this weekends doors open event","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Doors Open event is to return to Aberdeenshire this weekend.Held over two days, it will involve a iety of castles, estates, museums and churches.Some will be included for the first time, such as Blairs Museum and Beannachar Camphill Campus, both on South Deeside Road.The National Trust for Scotland will take part for a second year but this time Castle Fraser will be added to the programme of events.In total, 48 buildings are taking part, which is up from 38 the previous year.Councillor Peter Argyle, chairman of Aberdeenshire Council’s infrastructure services committee, urged the public to find out more about places taking part.He said: “Doors Open Days provide a great opportunity to celebrate our local heritage, explore some of the many assets we have here on our doorstep and do something different for a day.“Please have a look on the website to see what might interest you.”A number of buildings that have proved popular in previous years have returned for this weekend’s event.They include Tod Head Lighthouse in Catterline and Braemar Castle, plus Glen Tanar Estate is opening a number of its properties to the public.In Banff, an old merchant’s house with its own private lookout tower dating back to 1676 will be open again, along with the new Silver Smithy Centre.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautiful and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live life as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them. Throughout September, headline partner M\u0026ampS will be selling a selection of limited edition coffee morning products \u0026#8211 including lots of cakes, biscuits and two exclusive mugs \u0026#8211 with 10 per cent of proceeds going to Macmillan.Homes, workplaces and communities from the Shetland Islands to Land’s End will be hosting coffee mornings this year readers in Argyll and Bute can find events nearby using the interactive map on the Coffee Morning website www.macmillan.org.uk/coffee.Thank you to everyone who gets involved.Joanna Lumley, actress and Macmillan supporterSir,The SNP announced it is starting up a new \u0026#8216fact-checking\u0026#8217 service to monitor the accuracy of research and political statements.Many people in Scotland will be wondering if the SNP will be fact-checking the cost of its new independence blueprint.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most individual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

Joe Chapman, 23, is taking part in this September’s Great Scottish Run following the tragic death of his pregnant wife, Holly Chapman, to cystic fibrosis when she was just 23 years old. Holly was aged just one and a half when she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and although she was in and out of hospital regularly, it was something she kept very private to those around her. Joe said: “Holly and I met at the school we both attended down in England. “We started going out in 2010 and got married in August 2015. “I only found out she had the condition after about eight months of us being together. It wasn’t something she really spoke about, she just dealt with it. “It was probably around 2012 that we noticed her health slowly deteriorating. “She would be in hospital around two to three times a year for a two-week period to go on an IV drip to boost her immune system and clear chest infections. “Every year since then she would be in hospital more and more.” Due to Holly needing IV drips more frequently, Joe and Holly’s Mum received training to give Holly IV drips from home, rather than being in hospital for long periods at a time. On November 27, 2017 Holly found out she was pregnant, but at the same time her health was beginning to deteriorate at a much faster rate. Joe said: “Holly was needing to be in hospital for around six to seven weeks at a time. “I remember her being let out for six days at Christmas but she really couldn’t do much herself, she got too out of breath. “I had to carry her up and down the stairs and help her get dressed. She was also permanently on oxygen.” This continued through until March 8 this year, where Holly had a fit at home and was taken away in an ambulance to Ayr Hospital. She was transferred to a specialist unit in Glasgow, where her health got slightly better over the next couple of days. Joe added: “The specialist advised if she didn’t improve, that we should consider aborting our baby. On March 13, Holly became so ill that we decided it was time to let her be at peace and we made the decision to turn off her ventilator. Holly left the world far too young due to this horrible disease. “Cystic fibrosis is a really common disease but not many people know much about it which I why I decided to take part in the Great Scottish Run, to raise awareness and also raise vital funds for the trust.” You can sponsor Joe via his JustGiving page: https:www.justgiving/fundraising/joe-chapman9Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr HospitalCystic FibrosisCharityAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrs station hotel undergo 24","story":"NewsAyr\u0027s Station Hotel to undergo 24 hour rescue operation aimed at re-opening platforms to ScotRail trainsThe crumbling building is the subject of a large exclusion zone which has rendered much of Ayr station a no-go zone.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:43, 11 SEP 2018NewsStation Hotel in Ayr \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA painstaking mission aimed at re-opening parts of Ayr railway station is to get underway. Safety teams will work 24 hours a day to try and get the hub moving again. Work, which begins this Saturday, is expected to last until mid-October. Council bosses hope their move will reduce the extended exclusion zone which has paralysed the town\u0027s train station. Services to Glasgow Central are currently restricted in size with all six carriage trains halting at Prestwick Town. All trains south of Ayr are cancelled. Contractors are now set to move in with the aim of reinstating those lost services. Council chief executive, Eileen Howat, said: The extended exclusion zone at the train station – and its impact on rail services – is far from ideal, but we’ve had to take this action to keep people safe and that’s something we cannot, and will not, take any chances with. Our priority right now is to do what’s needed to allow the extended exclusion zone to be reduced when safe to do so and for rail services to get back to normal, and that’s exactly what we’re doing.  Once that has been achieved, we will continue to progress the wider programme of public safety works as well as the works to complete a structural survey, which will help inform the next steps with regards to the building’s future.   Andrew Mackie, Transport Scotland’s Head of Rail Franchising, added: In the longer term, any solution identified must contribute to the economic prosperity of the town centre and the communities south of Ayr currently without a train service.  This means we need to explore all the available options for dealing with the Station Hotel property which, in its current state, presents a significant safety risk not only to the railway line but also the immediate vicinity.  Only by continuing to work in close partnership with the relevant agencies and the local community can we reach an effective solution for everyone concerned - particularly those passengers, the local community and businesses directly affected.   ScotRail Head of Service Planning, Dave Smith, said: The beginning of the works to remove the extended exclusion zone is a fantastic step forward and until then we are working flat out to keep our customers moving.

Debby McKenzie had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis with a future that looked downhill all the way. She admits not in her wildest dreams could she have imagined her life now. Debby, who turned 50 on Tuesday, is just back from a three-month odyssey to Uganda. It was her first visit after setting up the charity McKenzie Clinic which focuses on children with the worst medical conditions. Some remote parts of the country she went to were a 10-hour drive over pot-holed dirt roads from her base in the capital Kampala. And she found herself packed in the back of overcrowded people carriers, with chickens running loose at her feet. Debby, who grew up in Prestwick but now lives in Ayr, said: “It is not very nice to be perfectly honest. It is a country with nothing. “It was always my dream to go to Africa and do some volunteer work, but it has escalated into a full blown charity which I registered in May 2017.” She has used her networking skills to bring volunteers together and they fund operations and aftercare for the children. Uganda was declared independent from Britain in 1962 and is landlocked, though you would not realise it, as the vast Lake Victoria straddles half its southern border. The great lake is 85 per cent the size of Scotland. The population is about 42 million and seems to attract dictators – Idi Amin during the seventies the most notorious. And it is dirt poor, says Debby, with lost of aid going to line the pockets of the rich. She flew into Entebbe and then headed to her host family in the capital where she stayed. From there, she visited ious organisations in all parts of the country. Debby, a divorced mum-of-one, revealed: “The roads are a nightmare and I always went by public transport. You get chickens at your feet and chickens on the roof. “It is very backward and for a couple of years I had been supporting charities there and they invited me over, so I decided I would go.” It is estimated some of the charities Debby was donating to were only able to get 30 per cent of funds to the people who needed them, the rest going to buy luxury goods for the elite. Debby said: “The aftercare is so important, I didn’t want them to be operated on then we walk away. “They have no life, no food and are malnourished. So I find sponsors to get them food weekly, mattresses and try and get them schooling. “We have just enrolled a girl into college who wants to be a hairdresser and we have paid the first year’s fee and accomodation. “People are joining the charity all the time as they want to help and I have been able to build a medical team on the ground in Uganda. “I have a huge online team of volunteers.” Debby was an independent financial adviser but eventually had to give up the business when she was diagnosed with MS 19 years ago.  She said: “I spent years not being able to see out of my right eye, I couldn’t speak, I lost my  co-ordination and I was paralysed down my right side.  “I was bed-ridden for a good couple of years.” She buried herself in research, went on to natural medications, exercised and changed her diet. Combined with a positive mental attitude it actually worked – and she is now sympton and fatigue free. Debby went on: “I really thought my life was over. But it is not, and it is now my time to help others.” The charity has seven acres of ground and the next project is to build a medical village and eco farm. Volunteers pay to get themselves out to Africa, but the charity pays for accomodation, transport and food. Debby added: “My big thing at the moment is we dont just want to operate or treat the children, we want to make sure they are going to be ok. “Everywhere you go you see horrific surgical cases, some of it is mind-blowing. “Most of the time I just have to step over them and walk away because I cannot help everyone. That is the hardest part.” Debby’s daughter Jessica,28, said: “Mum found an African surgeon, Dr Allan Lubiite, who also was deeply concerned about the conditions that Ugandan families were living in. “Mum’s work has helped save many children already and is funded solely from 15,000 people who are part of her Facebook groups. “She calls herself the voice of the voiceless and I am so proud of her.” A fundraiser is being held at the Berkeley Hotel in Barns Street, Ayr on Monday September 17 in the shape of a psychic and BBQ evening. It is being held to cover the expenses of volunteers while they are part of a dentistry team heading to Uganda at the end of the year. Just turn up at the door at 6.30pm.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsFacebookSocial mediaCharityPrestwick"},{"url":null,"title":"people given say regeneration ayr","story":"NewsPeople are to be given a say on regeneration of Ayr town centreAn \u0027Olympic\u0027 class swimming pool earmarked to replace CitadelShare\u0026nbspBySarah Hilley12:46, 11 SEP 2018Updated09:50, 12 SEP 2018NewsCitadel Leisure Centre Ayr\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn “Olympic” class swimming pool is earmarked for Ayr High Street to replace the aging Citadel, writes Sarah Hilley And the recently cleared Riverside block will become a public square, radical new council proposals reveal. A museum in the Town Hall and a drive to convert empty shop units for housing have also been put forward. It is all part of South Ayrshire Council’s answer to save the ailing High Street and politicians are launching a consultation to get feedback. Revealing the masterplan, council leader Douglas Campbell said: “The Citadel is coming to the end of its useful life. We would like to speak to people about moving the swimming pool into the middle of the town.” Deputy council leader Brian McGinley said: “There is potential for an Olympic style swimming pool. We need Ayr to be a destination. “If we move it to the town centre we will have other businesses coming in because of the increased footfall.” Replacing the High Street with an easy clean surface to get rid of chewing gum and other grime is another proposal to clean up the town. Council offices have been ruled out for good at the Riverside site after public protest over designs. Instead council staff would work at the newly refurbished old Clydesdale Bank building, other existing offices and a new archives base at Ayr Academy. Councillor Campbell said: “It will be a large public square and we want to ask people if they think it is a good idea.” Planning rules are to be changed so empty ground floor shops can be transformed into homes. Councillor Campbell said: “We need to reduce the number of shops in Ayr. One way to do that is to move residential accommodation down to the ground floor. We want to encourage residential development at the bottom of the town. We want the High Street to work 18 hours a day instead of eight. The town centre is dead at night. It is off putting. People go to Prestwick for the buzz.” Councillor McGinley said: “Retail is dead. The town centre needs to be re-invigorated.” It is hoped the empty former bridal shop at the Town Hall could house a new museum. Councillor Campbell said: “We have some fantastic artefacts hidden away. Let’s get them out in the open.” All ideas have yet to undergo public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnMuseumsSouth Ayrshire CouncilPrestwickAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"stagecoach accused turning ayr street","story":"NewsStagecoach accused of turning Ayr street into \u0027deathtrap\u0027 as double deckers thunder down back roadNeighbours say double decker buses accessing the Waggon Road depot in Ayr are thundering along quiet Green Street at all times of the day and night after a route change.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson13:59, 7 SEP 2018NewsResidents protest outside the bus garage \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFurious residents claim a bus giant has turned their back street into a deathtrap.

It\u0026rsquos subjective.\n\u0026ldquoThe officers and the consultees have expressed reservations, even though they might not have objected.\n\u0026ldquoI think when you join together all these different aspects, of the reservoir, of the William Ogilvie cairn, the cumulative and residential impacts, in my view that makes this application unacceptable.\nA report put to the committee found that 75 comments had been submitted to Scottish Borders Council regarding the project, and all but one of those were objections.\nThe council also received objections from six community councils that would be within sight of the wind farm, and Hawick councillors David Paterson and Watson McAteer also voiced their objections.\nThe latter wrote to his fellow councillors, imploring them to reject the wind farm: \u0026ldquoThis application is a test and should this authority grant the application it is in danger of sending a signal to all developers that rejection is simply a temporary set back and that after some fine tuning reapplication is likely to be successful.\n\u0026ldquoThis approach is debilitating for fragile communities who are being worn down by commercial enterprises that bring financial muscle to a process destined to create over proliferation, landscape desecration and wind turbine blight to a naturally beautiful area of the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoMembers, those I represent can see no valid reason why the previous rejection is not equally valid today and it is your responsibility to ensure that this community is listened to.\n\u0026ldquoIt is quite ridiculous that those who live and nurture this area are once again being called to fight to protect a precious environment, that includes a perilous roads network, from a profit centred business who have no interest in the effect their development will have on such a historic rural community.\nNot all councillors opposed the development, however, with East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing proposing a motion to support officer\u0026rsquos recommendations and approve the application, which Tweeddale East councillor Eric Small seconded.\nCouncillor Laing said the revised plans were a big improvement on the 2012 application: \u0026ldquoI think there has been a significant change to what they have proposed.\n\u0026ldquoI do have my concerns, particularly around the impact on nearby properties, but on balance I am supportive of the officer\u0026rsquos recommendations. There are lots of advantages to this.\nDespite councillor Laing and councillor Small\u0026rsquos support for the bid, the remaining five members of the committee voted to reject the

energy supplementary guidance, dated March 2018, as having the highest capacity for wind turbine development.\n\u0026ldquoWe were especially disappointed with the decision, given that the application was presented at the planning committee with no objections from any of the statutory consultees and was recommended for approval by the council\u0026rsquos own chief planning officer.\n\u0026ldquoWe

said demolition was the only economically viable option left.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoThe building is not physically incapable of repair, therefore the overriding principle that needs to be satisfied is one of economic viability.\n\u0026ldquoThis application is supported by feasibility reports and valuations which estimate the building is beyond the point of economic repair.\n\u0026ldquoVarious

Before the official opening, our reporter Hilary Scott met up with Susan Meikle and Hazel Millen, owners of the Allotment, who stepped in to save the day following the closure of the previous Post Office on the High Street.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot ever their dream to be postal mistresses. Susan and Hazel were content running their successful store, which has been selling fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, wholefoods, jams and chutney since 2011.\nThey had always been open to suggestions from residents on new products and ideas \u0026ndash creating a monthly cheese tasting evening, and a popular home delivery service.\nWhen news hit the town of the Post Office closure in February last year, the community fought a hard campaign to see its full-time service return.\nThe impact of the closure was felt by the Allotment and other High Street businesses. Susan explained: \u0026ldquoWhen it closed, a lot of people who previously used the Post Office started going out of the town and naturally doing their shopping elsewhere. It hit Innerleithen hard.\nThe pair had previously laughed off any suggestions by locals that they could house the Post Office within their store.\nBut one evening in late December, something moved Susan to click a link online to find out more information \u0026ndash and from this very moment, the revival of the Post Office began.\nNo-one had officially approached them to take on the Post Office, so when asked what moved them to send the application, Susan and Hazel looked at one another and mused: \u0026ldquoYou could call it insanity!\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot easily signed, sealed and delivered. There were many loop holes to jump through, including applications, interviews and trips to Glasgow for training, before they could start running Innerleithen\u0026rsquos new service from their premises.\nAnd although Susan and Hazel say they will not financially benefit by taking on this new responsibility, they feel the gain is retaining a vital service for the people of Innerleithen.\nVariety is the spice of life, and for the Allotment owners and their two hardworking members of staff Leanne and Susan, they\u0026rsquoll be juggling more than apples and pears on occasions. \u0026ldquoI hope people give us a chance. It is going to be a challenge running the Post Office and serving our valued customers, added Susan. \u0026ldquoThere are going to be times that there will be a queue and we would appreciate people\u0026rsquos patience. We are new to this. It might take a little longer for us to do things, but it will be done right.\nI on the other-hand like to think that a little festive magic played its part in the happy ending to this tale, and somewhere in this quaint town, the one request on someone\u0026rsquos Christmas list was that the community didn\u0026rsquot lose its postal service.\nAnd it wasn\u0026rsquot delivered by a postman, or a man with a white beard wearing a red suit and black boots. It was answered and delivered by these two brave and ambitious local ladies, who with the community at heart, saved Innerleithen\u0026rsquos Post Office.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"photos-group-of-flamingo-chicks-hatch-in-oxton","story":"A GROUP of flamingo chicks have hatched at a Borders conservation centre.\nNews of the arrival of the Chilean flamingo flock was confirmed by Bird Gardens Scotland.\nThe newborns\u0026nbspwill form part of a new visitor attraction in Oxton, near Lauder.\nThe chicks hatched from eggs laid by the established Chilean flamingo flock at Chester Zoo.\nThe flock at Chester had a breeding success earlier in the summer, leading to a number of surplus eggs.\nThe eggs in question were incubated by the Bird Section in Chester prior to being carefully transported to Bird Gardens Scotland in Oxton, to hatch.\nIts not been confirmed how many chicks there are.\nFollowing on from hatching, the eggs will take 30 days to develop into healthy flamingo chicks, also known as flaminglings.\nMark Haillay of Bird Gardens Scotland said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos an incredible moment when you first hear a flamingo egg grunt at you and you know that within 48 hours there will be a chick asleep, resting after its epic journey from inside the egg out into the world.\nLike many other types of bird, flaminglings have an egg-tooth on the tip of their beak which they use to gradually scratch and chip away at the shell creating an opening large enough for them to wriggle free of the shell and out into the world.\nThe flaminglings will be hand reared in Oxton, fed every two hours round the clock with a specialist liquidised diet fed through a syringe.\nThis mimics the beak-to-beak feeding which would occur in parent reared birds parent flamingos produce a rich saliva  and dribble this into the chick\u0026rsquos beak providing all the water, nutrients and energy they need to grow and stay healthy.\nMark added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos incredibly exciting to think these little balls of grey fluff will grow to be majestic flamingos.

last week, when retired local GP John Wilson undertook the same 87-mile cycle ride made in 1916 by the town\u0026rsquos legendary medical practitioner, Dr John Muir, at the age of 71.\nDr Muir served the medical needs of Selkirk from 1867-1928, becoming one of the local community\u0026rsquos most respected and well-loved figures.\nNot only was he a keen cyclist, he kept a meticulous record of his family life and his day-to-day dealings with the public in a series of diaries.\nIn 2014, some 40 of Dr Muir\u0026rsquos diaries were presented by his descendants to the Scottish Borders Archive \u0026amp Local History Service, and these were then transcribed by staff at Hawick\u0026rsquos Heritage Hub.\nTwo years later, at the request of Live Borders, Selkirk playwright and actor John Nichol used material from the diaries as the basis for his one-man, one-act play, Dr John Stewart Muir: The Beloved Doctor.\nTaking the title role himself, John\u0026rsquos play received a rapturous reception at its premiere in the town\u0026rsquos County Hotel in February, 2017.\nOne scene features Dr Muir recounting an ambitious cycle ride he took to Moffat in 1916, returning via Boreland, Eskdalemuir and Ettrickbridge.\nIt is this ride that retired local GP John Wilson retraced last Wednesday, following the exact route described by Dr Muir.\n\u0026ldquoI always thought it would be amazing to recreate that ride, John told the Border  this week, \u0026ldquoso I\u0026rsquom just so happy that John Wilson was able to do it.\nJust as Dr Muir had done before him, John stopped off at Moffat\u0026rsquos Buccleuch Arms Hotel, where he was welcomed by director Polly Smith, while on the return journey he stopped at the Cross Keys in Ettrickbridge, where he was given a glass of water by owner Trevor Logan.\nDr Wilson\u0026rsquos encounters throughout the day were filmed by retired Selkirk journalist John Smail, who is making a documentary entitled A Souter\u0026rsquos Year, covering all aspects of life in Selkirk and the Valleys during 2018.\nAt the end of Wednesday\u0026rsquos ride Dr Wilson, himself an extremely proficient road cyclist, said he\u0026rsquod thoroughly enjoyed the experience.\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe landscape is spectacular and it makes you appreciate the history and cultural importance of this area.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure Dr Muir would

nurseries for delivering increased free childcare has come in for criticism by inspectors.\nLanglee Primary School Nursery is one of seven early learning centres across the Borders trialling an increase in funded early learning and childcare from 600 to 1140 hours.\nBy 2020 the additional hours should be available across the whole Borders.\nEducation bosses at Scottish Borders Council believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a significant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be significantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see if there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite significantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either \u0027very good\u0027 or \u0027good\u0027 the latest inspection found the quality of environment, of staffing, and of management as only \u0027adequate\u0027 with only the level of care and support still deemed \u0027good\u0027.\nA spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: \"The council has already taken significant steps following the care inspectorate visit and has addressed a number of the matters raised, for example improving lunch routines.\n\"SBC takes very seriously any recommendations made during these inspections and regularly monitors progress.\n\"We are confident that the matters raised in the report are being addressed and additional support will be provided to ensure good progress is achieved quickly.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"wallace-or-scott-selkirk-to-decide-on-new-signs","story":"PLANS are being drawn up for new tourism signage at Selkirk\u0026rsquos four main entrances \u0026ndash

local organisations, the ambitious target was reached.\nThe fundraising effort has now triggered the release of a European Leader grant of \u0026pound150,000, along with a combination of other grants, which means that the theatre now has the budget to transform its auditorium.\nThe revamp forms phase one of the \u0027Building on success\u0027 strategy to develop the building and make it more customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the theatre to offer some seats at a reduced ticket price.\nLow level safety lighting will be introduced into the new side balconies, and new heating ducts will be installed to deliver hot air at floor level.\nSir David Younger, chair of the Eastgate board of directors said: \u0026ldquoThe Board would like to thank most sincerely the Eastgate staff, the Friends of the Eastgate and all donors who rose magnificently to the challenge of raising a sizeable sum of money in a very short space of time.\n\u0026ldquoThe theatre was first developed in 2004 by the efforts of the local community and it is heartening for all of us to realise that all these years later it is still so valued.\n\u0026ldquoBy levering the European Leader grant the local fundraising has made a huge impact locally.\n\u0026ldquoThis, combined with the success of general manager Caroline Adam in attracting other significant capital grants will help to ensure that the people of Tweeddale and much further afield have an arts venue well equipped to meet future needs.\nDonations to the appeal came in all shapes and sizes ranging from a little boy who put 50p of his pocket money into the donations box in the foyer to an American couple who transferred a four-figure sum. A bullock donated by local farmer Robert Barr now has Muchacoo  on his passport after dozens of visitors to the Peebles Agricultural show each paid \u0026pound5 to name him.\nAll of the money raised will go towards the development of the Eastgate Theatre building.\nDiscussions are already underway about progressing to phase two which will improve and reconfigure the foyer/caf\u0026eacute areas.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sheriff-orders-gala-woman-to-hand-over-car-keys","story":"A GALASHIELS woman has been ordered to give up her car keys after being accused of two drink driving offences in the space of two months.\nJune McKain has been told she cannot drive a vehicle until the outcome of her trial in November.\nThe 58-year-old of Ladhope Crescent, appeared from custody at Selkirk Sheriff Court where she pleaded not guilty to a charge of driving with a breath/alcohol count of 42 microgrammes - the legal limit being 22 - on Saturday.\nShe was released on bail which had the special conditions of not driving and giving up her car keys.\nMcKain was already waiting trial on a charge of driving while more than four times the legal limit.\nThe offence is alleged to have been committed in the Asda Car Park in Galashiels on July 19.\nAn intermediate hearing has been fixed for October 22.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"pussy-riot-activist-may-have-taken-overdose-of-medication","story":"A member of Russia protest group Pussy Riot may have been poisoned by an overdose of medication, it has been reported.\nIndependent news website Meduza said that Pyotr Verzilov\u0026rsquos doctors told his relatives that he either overdosed on medicine or was given too much medicine.\nFellow Pussy Riot member Veronika Nikulshina told the Associated Press that the report was accurate but would not comment further.\nPyotr Verzilov invaded the pitch during the World Cup final \nFriends insisted that Mr Verzilov had not been taking medication or using drugs.

Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a different pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang returned, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924. In 1925 a christian name is inscribed for the first time, when, Bella Strang, taking her third win, was partnered by  Mr C. MacTaggart.Mrs W. McKersie and Mr C. McTaggart won in 1926 and Miss S. Colville and Mr R. W. Greenlees in 1927.Mrs Mary MacFadyen, was the next winner to gain the christian name honour in 1928 and she did not have take three wins.The first and possibly only gentleman to see his christian name used, was the prolific 1950\u0026#8217s winner, Rev.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"work-on-flats-at-former-musselburgh-tesco-set-to-start-in-spring","story":"  Plans were approved by East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee nearly a year ago.

Duo Gymnastics, based at the Aubigny Sports Centre, Haddington, is keen to buy a new vaulting table, which costs about \u0026pound1,000.  Jane said: \u0026ldquoWhat I have been really impressed with is the way the club and coaches have adapted to him.  \u0026ldquoThere is mainstream gymnastics but they have adapted lessons for his needs.  \u0026ldquoIt has made him not feel different and he still feels part of the club \u0026ndash he really enjoys it.  \u0026ldquoCameron\u0026rsquos disability comes under Global Development Delay.  \u0026ldquoHe has a real difficulty with comprehension and understanding what is being asked of him, following instructions.  \u0026ldquoHe is also very sensitive to noise and sudden loud noises.  \u0026ldquoThat is what they have managed to do really well, break it down into small parts for him.  \u0026ldquoThrough time, it becomes a routine and he understands what is being asked of him.  Jane, who lives near Gifford, has been a keen swimmer for a number of years and represented Scotland in the 1994 Commonwealth Games, in Canada.  However, after a break from swimming she returned to the pool at the beginning of the year before swapping the pool for the sea earlier this summer.  She said: \u0026ldquoI kept swimming as a hobby and to keep fit.  \u0026ldquoI have always swam but it has always been indoor swimming.  \u0026ldquoI started looking about and had always had an interest in open-water swimming but never did it.  \u0026ldquoI came across the Firth of Forth swim and that quite appeals to me and thought I would give it a go.  The mum-of-two signed up in March for the swim, which sees swimmers head off from Hawes Pier and swim alongside the Forth Bridge towards North Queensferry.  Swimmers set off at 2.10pm and have an hour to complete the 1.4-mile swim.  In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe currents are certainly a big factor.  \u0026ldquoIt is just your awareness and you can go off track very easily and just that anticipation of what is below you and what you are swimming over.  \u0026ldquoI have enjoyed the challenge and it has certainly put me out of my comfort zone.  \u0026ldquoI have really enjoyed it and met some really lovely people.  \u0026ldquoMy thanks go to my husband, Garry, and family for support and encourage to take on the challenge and to Duo Gymnastics Club for the support and help they have given Cameron.  Pamela Fletcher, from the gymnastics club, said: \u0026ldquoThanks to Jane undertaking the swim, the club can purchase a new and much needed vaulting table for the gymnastics at Aubigny Sport Centre. Due to local support we have now met our target however donations continue meaning we can hopefully purchase some more equipment.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

The latest development will be to the east of the site earmarked for a new primary school on the large development area on Haddington\u0026rsquos western edge which is expected to have more than 800 new homes once complete.  Provost John McMillan, ward councillor, raised concerns from local constituents about dust and road washing equipment used on the site over the summer.  Charles Church, from Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, told the committee concerns had been raised about issues with the building contractors used on the site and they were looking at possible penalties for any future breaches of the agreed construction management plan.  Mr McMillan asked if it would be possible for any financial penalties paid to be put towards local community groups or projects. Mr Church told him that was a consideration, adding that Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ldquoalready has a fund called building communities where we invest in local communities.  The revised plans were approved unanimously.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to see Letham Mains moving forward and the site coming together.  Following the meeting, Craig Ormond, director of Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, said: \u0026ldquoLethington Gardens already features Design Collection properties, so we wanted to ensure that these neighbouring houses have a similar look and feel in design terms. We are delighted that the council have agreed with us.  Lethington Gardens is part of a wider masterplan by a number of housing developers in the area.  The plans include a new primary school at the heart of the development \u0026ndash to be home to nearly 500 pupils \u0026ndash sport pitches and changing facilities, as well as a new park running east/west alongside the Letham Burn."},{"url":null,"title":"rugby-club-needs-cctv-after-licence-change","story":"  North Berwick RFC  applied to East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board for the licence, which allows it to welcome non-members to events. But it was granted with several conditions, including that the club must tell police about any 18th or 21st birthday parties being held in the Recreation Park clubhouse at least two weeks in advance.  They were also ordered to use plastic glasses in an outdoor marquee at the club and banned from playing music on a planned new patio area.  A Police Scotland request for the club to install CCTV \u0026ldquoof a standard approved by police inside and outside the venue was also granted by the board.  Rudi Fruzynski, the council\u0026rsquos licensing standards officer, told the board that the club had changed into a community hub in recent years and had been moving towards changing its licence for some time.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not just a rugby club any longer \u0026ndash it has several different aspects to it as a community hub.  \u0026ldquoI do not see a problem in relation to the licence.  Iain Dove, NBRFC president, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are pleased with the news that the licensing board have approved our application for a full licence, along with an identified area to the front of the club that can be used for drinks in good weather.  \u0026ldquoThis will be a fenced area, secure for children, and we hope it will prove to be popular with families. We hope to continue to grow the use of our facilities by the North Berwick community.  At the meeting, Mr Fruzynski criticised the club for not sending anyone to attend the hearing, at Haddington Town House last Thursday.  Highlighting that they were not the only applicants to fail to attend the hearing that day, he said: \u0026ldquoIt is disappointing so many applicants have not turned up to answer questions of the board because they are all advised that someone should be available to attend.  Mr Dove apologised to the licensing board, via the Courier, and added: \u0026ldquoThis is the first time that we have changed our licence and we simply didn\u0026rsquot know that it was possible to attend.  Councillor Jane Henderson, a North Berwick Coastal ward member who sits on the licensing board, pointed out that the club\u0026rsquos failure to represent itself could prove financially costly as they were not able to challenge conditions attached to the licence. The board granted the licence with a condition that CCTV must be in place within three months."},{"url":null,"title":"food-and-drink-taste-testers-wanted-for-queen-margaret-university-panel","story":"  Aimed at people aged 18 and upwards, the short tasting sessions will be held during weekdays in the evenings and at weekends \u0026ndash with participants receiving a \u0026pound10 gift voucher at the end of each.

But she then failed to inform the authorities that she was living with Steven Cairns, who was in full-time employment, between April 2016 and December 2017.  McLean, 43, pleaded guilty when she appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court last month and she returned to the dock last Wednesday for sentencing.

They applied for permission to sell drinks so that customers could enjoy \u0026ldquoa cold beer on a summer evening after demand for local produce from their customers grew.  Pauline told East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in a statement: \u0026ldquoWe are stocking more and more local produce as there is a clear want for this in the village.  \u0026ldquoWe would like to stock for sale and consumption on the premises and garden some local cider, beer, wine and gin from, for example Thistly Cross and NB Gin, supporting local crafters and providing the village with these items without having to commute too far.  She asked the board to grant The Bothy a licence to serve alcohol on-site between 11am and 9pm, and off-sales from 10am to 9pm seven days a week.  The board was asked by police to reduce the time for serving alcohol in the garden area to 8pm in the evenings.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational significance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as if it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.  The committee voted to reject the recommendation to approve the plans by seven votes to four."},{"url":null,"title":"north-berwick-hotel-shuts-suddenly","story":"  The County Hotel, run since 2016 by Tony Breathnach, has been shut since last Thursday.\u0026nbsp  The 10-bedroom High Street hotel, which also includes a bar and dining area, was leased to Mr Breathnach by Star Pubs \u0026amp Bars, part of Heineken UK.

The cake was made by food artist and cake sculptor Michelle Wibowo and was featured on Channel 4\u0027s tea-time programme Extreme Cake Makers.  The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.  She then printed the exterior of the shop onto edible paper, placing it onto the skeleton on the building.  For the finer details, Michelle used a sugar paste which she sculpted by hand.  The cake itself was crafted in Hayward\u0027s Heath, West Sussex, and then driven to Brighton, where Tranent-born George works.  \"He wanted to help revive the centre of town, so he\u0027s taken on a derelict building, and he\u0027s totally restoring it,\" said Sharon.  George bought the building on the corner of High Street in late 2015, and planned to renovate it into a mixture of shops, cafes\u0026nbspand a Post Office.  Upon seeing Michelle\u0027s creation, Sharon exclaimed: \"It\u0027s exactly what I wanted. It\u0027s got total wow factor. I think it\u0027s absolutely incredible. It just doesn\u0027t look like cake.\"  George, when he was finally let in on the surprise, agreed: \"When I first came in, I actually thought the cake was just a cardboard model. Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architect\u0027s model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake. He didn\u0027t want to cut it and was desperately trying to find a way to get it back to Scotland. We pointed out it wasn\u0027t possible because we wanted to eat it.  \"Michelle totally delivered on the cake, so she\u0027s probably the first person in George\u0027s life that has actually managed to do something to surprise him.\"  The show is available on Channel 4\u0027s streaming service All 4.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her life and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

Perth Sheriff Court was told on Wednesday that the assault conviction was likely to lead to his dismissal from his job driving vulnerable people for the local authority.  Solicitor Jamie Baxter, defending, said: \"He has held employment with Glasgow City Council as a driver for children with special needs for 19 years.  \"As a consequence of this it is likely that his job will be terminated. He is already suspended and subject to an ongoing investigation.\"  Sheriff Gillian Wade, who found McIntosh guilty of assault after a trial, fined him \u0026pound750.  She told him: \"It was a most unfortunate incident to have taken place and you are now suffering the consequences of having a conviction for assault on your record.  \"This will be very much felt by yourself. It is important you put this behind you.\"  McIntosh was driving a coach full of Celtic fans which crashed into a car in a road rage incident on the A9. He then parked and got out to punch Mr Wall, from Uphall, in the face.  Mr Wall told the court: \"My wife Alexa was asleep. The bus sped up as I was braking. The chevrons were coming up and the lanes were merging.  \"The bus was driving right behind me. I saw him gesticulating at me. I thought it was some sort of road rage about something.  \"He was hooting his horn and flashing his lights and my wife woke up. I thought I should slow down in case anything happened.  \"I was frightened. My wife was frightened.\"  He said the bus pulled out into the oncoming carriageway to overtake but cars appeared travelling towards them and McIntosh swerved the football coach back in.  \"The bus pulled over and hit the rear of my car. I was trying to keep the car straight on the road. The car bounced. I felt it shudder.  \"It was quite clear we had been hit at about 50 miles per hour. My hands were shaking,\" Mr Wall said.  He pulled into a layby and was followed in by the bus full of Celtic fans returning from their match against Ross County in Dingwall.  As the supporters got out and urinated, McIntosh stormed past Mrs Wall and punched her husband in the face and knocked off his glasses.  Mr Wall said: \"I looked up to see the bus driver standing over me. There was a look of anger and the fist came down like a hammer. I saw his raised fist above me and he banged it down on my temple.  \"I hammered backwards into the car. I saw a white light.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"senior-teacher-at-scots-boarding-school-suspended-after-deeply-disturbing-allegations","story":"  A senior teacher at Loretto School in Musselburgh, East Lothian, the oldest boarding school in Scotland, has been suspended following what the headmaster has confirmed are \u0026lsquodeeply disturbing\u0026rsquo allegations.  The police and Care Inspectorate have been informed, and an investigation into claims linked to the teacher\u0026rsquos alleged behaviour is now underway.  Details of the precise nature of the complaint have not yet been confirmed, and investigations into the allegations are believed to be at an early stage.  However headteacher Dr Graham Hawley has said they relate to behaviour which is not tolerated at the school.  Loretto School is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos leading fee-paying schools, where parents pay up to \u0026pound33,600 a year to board senior pupils.  It regularly receives top ratings and is particularly renowned for its drama, music, art and sport.  Headmaster, Dr Graham Hawley said: \u0026ldquoAs Headmaster and as a parent, I am deeply disturbed by these allegations and I take them very seriously.  \u0026ldquoThe alleged behaviour is unacceptable and has no place in our community. It is everything that we are not.  \u0026ldquoAs soon as the allegations were brought to us we took action: we alerted the police, we alerted the Care Inspectorate, we instigated an internal investigation, we suspended the member of staff in question.  \u0026ldquoThe school has undertaken extensive work to ensure it is as safe an environment as it is possible for a school to be. We have built a culture in which pupils can feel empowered to come forward, to seek and find the support they need in situations like this.  Loretto School is one of the country\u0026rsquos top private schools, with parents paying up to \u0026pound33,600 a year to board senior children at its 85 acre leafy campus, which features its own golf academy. Around 400 boys and girls attend Loretto Senior School, with around 70 per cent opting to board.  A further 200 attend the Junior School, while the nursery caters for children from birth to five years old.  Former pupils at the school, which was founded in 1827, include broadcaster Andrew Marr, former Chancellors of the Exchequer Norman Lamont and Alistair Darling and motor racing legend Jim Clarke. Movie director Don Boyd, whose films have included Scum, Look Back in Anger and The Great Rock \u0026lsquon\u0026rsquo Roll Swindle, is also a former pupil at the school.  Last year\u0026rsquos Tatler Schools Guide placed Loretto School in the top seven per cent nationally and singled out the \u0026ldquospectacular dance and drama studio for particular praise.  A spokesperson for the Care Inspectorate confirmed a probe is underway.

Anyone with a concern about a care service can contact us on 0345 600 9527.  Dr Hawley added: \u0026ldquoGiven the sensitivities of this situation, the investigation, and involvement of the authorities, I am limited in what more I can say however, I am committed to ensuring that Loretto is a school where no behaviour of this alleged kind will ever be tolerated."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-unfit-to-govern-and-incapable-of-leadership-blasts-snps-ian-blackford","story":"  Speaking at PMQs, Mr Blackford set out how the last 10 years had been the worst decade for wage growth for 200 years, laying the blame on Tory austerity policies.

Multiple organ failure was said to have led to Mrs Baxter\u0026rsquos death, with sacrocolopexy mesh repair \u0026ndash an implant to fix a pelvic organ prolapse \u0026ndash noted as an underlying cause.  Her son Mark, 52, has called for the products to be completely banned.    Ms Freeman said\u0026nbspNHS boards had been told to halt the use of mesh in cases of pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence.This will continue until a new \"restricted use protocol\" is drawn up.  Other mesh procedures, such as transabdominal mesh, will be kept under active review and will also be subject to high vigilance procedures.She also praised the bravery of women who have come forward to share their problems following vaginal mesh surgery.  Healthcare Improvement Scotland has established a group to oversee any continued use of the treatment.  And Ms Freeman said the chief medical officer has continued to keep the issueunder review and is listening to the women who have been affected of this.  She said: \u0026ldquoI have today asked the Chief Medical Officer to instruct Health Boards to immediately halt the use of transvaginal mesh altogether in cases of both pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence, pending the implementation of a new restricted use protocol that will ensure procedures are carried out only in the most exceptional circumstances and subject to a robust process of approval and fully informed consent.  \u0026ldquoThe instruction to halt is, I believe, a proportionate measure whilst a rigorous, high vigilance restricted use ptotocol for any future practice is developed and put in place.  \u0026ldquoThe lifting of this halt in use can only be considered once there is confidence that there is sufficient evidence that the protocol can only be triggered in only the most limited of circumstances \u0026ndash informed by any new evidence and the forthcoming NICE guidance which is expected in the spring of next year on the management of pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence.

The review was announced by the Scottish Government in 2014, with health boards requested to stop the procedure until its conclusion.  It remains under suspension in NHS Scotland except in exceptional circumstances.  The review\u0026rsquos final report was branded a \u0026ldquowhitewash by some women who have suffered painful and debilitating complications from mesh, including campaigners Elaine Holmes and Olive McIlroy.  Professor Alison Britton has been commissioned to conduct a review of the review, which is due to report later this year.      6 years of campaigning with the brilliant Elaine Holmes and @MBLacey of the Scottish mesh survivors and we have got the Scottish Govt to see sense and ban mesh implants - this could have been done 6 years ago. pic.twitter/aOuiVpoaS7  Mrs\u0026nbspBaxter\u0026nbspfrom Loanhead, died in hospital in Edinburgh last month.\u0026nbsp  She underwent mesh surgery five years ago.

Hundreds of women in Scotland have suffered painful and debilitating complications from being given mesh implants, including infections, bleeding and even paralysis.  The use of mesh implants in NHS Scotland was suspended four years ago in all but exceptional circumstances.

Dr Calum MacLeod, director of CLS, which represents Scotland\u0026rsquos community landowners, said: \u0026ldquoMuch of the public policy around the myth of so-called \u0026lsquowild\u0026rsquo land has airbrushed the community dimension out of many of Scotland\u0026rsquos rural landscapes.

This is likely to disappoint many Nationalists, including those who this weekend will gather in Glasgow for a Hope over Fear Yes rally.  The Scottish Government\u0026rsquos future agenda, published last week, stated: \u0026ldquoAt the end of the period of negotiation with the EU, and when the terms of Brexit are clearer, we will set out our judgement on the best way forward for Scotland at that time, including our view on the precise timescale for offering people a choice over the country\u0026rsquos future.

This will be followed by ratification by parliaments across the EU as well as the so-called \"meaningful vote\" at Westminster on the final deal, possibly before Christmas.  However, Mr Blackford was clear that, as the informed debate on the economics of independence continued following the publication of the Growth Commission\u0026rsquos report, no decision on when or whether to call for a second independence vote could be made until after the details of a deal were fully known.

Around 70 representatives from businesses in the east of Aberdeenshire attended the agri-tourism event at Fyvie Castle, where delegates had the opportunity to hear from speakers about current industry trends and network with tourism businesses locally.                                                    In Aberdeenshire, 65% of the population is based rurally – which highlights the wealth of opportunity that exists to continue to build, expand and be entrepreneurial with rural links, to continue to attract visitors to our part of Scotland. Nationally, the value of domestic visitor spend in rural areas amounts to £633 million and equates to 2.6 million domestic trips.                                                    Chris Greenwood, VisitScotland’s Senior Tourism Insights Manager, spoke to delegates about agricultural and rural tourism insights and the impacts and benefits for Aberdeenshire and Chris Foy, Chief Executive at VisitAberdeenshire presented the new destination strategy for Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, detailing how they hope to grow visitor spend to £1 billion per year by 2023.        A new plan to develop food and drink tourism in Scotland – aiming to deliver an additional £1 billion to Scotland’s economy by 2030 – was recently launched by Nicola Sturgeon. At the event, Peter Cook, Director of Food, Drink and Agriculture at Opportunity North East, updated those attending about Opportunity North East’s work within that sector.Jo Robinson, VisitScotland Regional Director, said: “I am delighted that representatives from so many businesses in East Aberdeenshire attended this event, which hopefully gave them real food for thought on the subject of rural tourism.“This region has tremendous assets and strengths that offer visitors a range of great experiences – from food and drink to farm shops, coasts to castles and woods to wigwams. VisitScotland helps to promote these strengths to a global audience.“With 21% of domestic visitor trips being to rural areas and 22% of domestic visitor spend being in rural areas, capitalising on these visitors is so important. Hopefully events like this can help rural businesses to make the most of these opportunities.”                                                                                                        Gillian Martin, Aberdeenshire East MSP, said: “We have one of the most diverse regions in Scotland with an abundance of historical and cultural significance and interest. There is so much to do and see in rural parts and right across Aberdeenshire and we must do all we can to maximise the opportunities for tourism and economic growth by attracting new visitors to the North-east.”Chris Foy, VisitAberdeenshire Chief Executive, added: “The event reflected the importance of rural tourism for the North-east which is a significant priority set within the destination strategy for the next five years.“It is encouraging to see the strong desire from local industry to work alongside VisitScotland and VisitAberdeenshire to strengthen the appeal of the destination to visitors, and the quality of the experience.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeenshire man s life saving call on honeymoon","story":"        Nick and Philippa Allan got married last August and just a week later received a call that changed their lives.

The campaign is being fronted by ordinary Scots, like Gordon Hutchinson who underwent a life-saving transplant, aged just 13.      \t         “I called and was told I needed to get down to Edinburgh right away.”It was a call Nick had waited two and a half years to receive. He was born with a kidney condition that meant neither of his organs worked properly.                                                                                                         He underwent surgery at 18 months old and then went for regular checkups to monitor how his kidneys were functioning.  At a routine appointment in October 2014, doctors delivered the news that his kidneys were failing and Nick started dialysis shortly after.He said: “I’d lived with the condition all my life so hearing that I’d need treatment was a shock. “The doctor told me I’d be lucky to make it to Christmas without being on dialysis but I held on until February 2015.                                                                                                        “By the time I went on dialysis, my kidney function had dropped to eight per cent. I thought I was okay but looking back I was constantly tired and agitated. Things were a bit of a struggle.”Nick was determined the dialysis would not take over his life and kept working throughout.He said: “I was team leader at that time for an oil company – in charge of the onshore group.“I was determined to keep on working and have as normal a life as possible but it meant doing dialysis every night after work.“I’d leave home at 7am and not get back until 10pm or 10.30pm every day                                                                                                         “Dialysis was hard. I felt like my life had been put on hold but I knew the treatment was the only thing keeping me alive. “Some days were better than others the staff at the hospital got me through some difficult times.”Despite that, Nick decided to propose to Philippa and booked the wedding at the Winter Gardens in the hope she would say yes.“I left flowers by the kettle one night – happily she said yes,” said Nick.“We’d been together for ten years and she saw me through everything.“She had to put up with an awful lot – the mood swings, not going out because I was too tired all the time – but she still said yes.”The couple got married last August and were on honeymoon when Nick got the call that would transform their lives.He said: “I was really lucky – I was only on the transplant list for two and a half years.“But I didn’t get my hopes up too much until I was taken down to theatre and knew it was going to happen.“I was building myself up for disappointment until that point. It was a really surreal experience.”Happily, the transplant went ahead and Nick woke up to a whole new life.“As soon as I woke up from surgery I instantly felt better,” he said. “Nothing could have prepared me for the difference it made.  “I’d just got married and then I got the gift that I’d waited over two years for.  “To have a life free from dialysis was the best feeling and I felt amazing. I didn’t realise how ill I’d been until I had the transplant and started to feel 100 times better. It was fantastic.”Nick, an electrician by trade, has made the most of his donor’s incredible gift – enjoying life to the full and setting up his own business.He said: “It was something I always wanted to do but would never have been able to achieve on dialysis.“I now have my own electrical business and am working all over Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.“It’s made a massive difference to Philippa and me too – we can go out and enjoy ourselves now. It’s nice to have that freedom it’s a new life basically.”As for his donor’s family, Nick has written a letter thanking them for his gift.He said: “I know nothing about the person who made my transplant possible but I owe them everything. “They saved my life and are truly my hero. I want their family to know I will be eternally grateful for this incredible gift.”Nick is already on the organ donor register and hopes his story will encourage others to sign up.He added: “It’s quite possibly the most important thing anyone can ever do.”To join the NHS Organ Donor Register, visit weneedeverybody.org                "},{"url":null,"title":"shop support for crafters","story":"        Local crafts handmade by crafters and artists across the area will now be showcased at an Inverurie shop.

September has a high rate of babies being born.\u0026ldquoStaff morale is already at an all-time low.

I can fully understand why someone at Raigmore would want to whistle-blow as it appears to be a pretty fraught situation.An NHS Highland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoDue to the unpredictable nature of maternity activity, cases are assessed on an individual basis and robust risk assessment and escalation plans are in place to ensure safe service provision.\u0026ldquoTo date, since accepting intrapartum transfers from Elgin, there has been no need for any Caithness woman to be diverted from Raigmore Hospital to deliver elsewhere due to staffing levels or capacity, as is being suggested by the midwife whom you interviewed.Thursday 13 Sep 2018 4:06 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Bower author helping Norn become the norm","story":"COMMON words and phrases used by Caithnessians may be thought of by locals as slang terms \u0026ndash but, by using them, they may have been reviving a dead language.Bower author Elspeth Grace Hall is doing her bit to revive the language of Norn that was once widely spoken in Caithness.Norn was officially declared a \u0026ldquodead language by world heritage body the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization .However, Grace Hall has been bringing about a revival of the region\u0026rsquos native tongue by writing a series of children\u0026rsquos workbooks to teach kids how to read and write in Norn.If Elspeth is successful in helping to increase the numbers of Norn speakers in Caithness, UNESCO could reverse its death declaration.They had once delivered a similar verdict on Kernowek \u0026ndash the native language of south-west English county, Cornwall.But in 2010, UNESCO announced that its former classification of the language as \u0026ldquoextinct was \u0026ldquono longer accurate.Grace Hall said: \u0026ldquoIf you have ever sat \u0026lsquoO a benk\u0026rsquo, fed the \u0026lsquoscorries\u0026rsquo, told your \u0026lsquomannie\u0026rsquo off for being a \u0026lsquoloon\u0026rsquo or simply popped off \u0026lsquotill\u0026rsquo the shops you have been speaking a second language \u0026ndash one that officially doesn\u0026rsquot even exist.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been intrigued by languages and the Caithness dialect is wonderfully rich.\u0026ldquoI started to investigate the etymology of words unique to Caithness and found that they weren\u0026rsquot part of Scots, English or Gaelic, they were in fact Norn. A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classification of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in if Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo if only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked if they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Thursday 13 Sep 2018 4:07 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the individual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Thursday 13 Sep 2018 4:07 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the lengthy cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it. We had always seen Marcus as he was at rugby \u0026ndash a strong, witty and kind gentleman. After talking with more team-mates who have opened up and described their own experiences the horrifying statistics become relatable.The cycling trio hope to be arriving at Land\u0026rsquos End in a fortnight\u0026rsquos time and are hoping to raise \u0026pound2000 for the Marcus in Mind fundraiser set up by his family.To make a donation, visit the website on: justgiving/crowdfunding/for-marcusThursday 13 Sep 2018 4:07 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September 13, 2018 at 3:00 pmFriends of Happy Valley — the charity group which cares for the much-loved and magical woodland garden in Stenness — is in the running for a prestigious national award.

This has made her challenge to find a way to climb the sea stack all the more unique and has presented a series of challenges in the planning stages.She will take on the climb in aid of the Calvert Trust, which supports people with disabilities through outdoor adventure.Asked why she had picked the Old Man of Hoy, Michelle laughed: \u0026#8220Because it\u0026#8217s the biggest sea stack going. I\u0026#8217d had the idea that I wanted to climb a sea stack before I was injured. It hadn\u0026#8217t really crossed my mind that I would ever be able to climb the old man of Hoy because it is notoriously difficult. I thought one day I would get it done but then I fell and I thought it\u0026#8217d never happen.\u0026#8220A friend came to me during rehab and said I needed to start setting myself goals and challenges but all my interests were based around climbing, which I didn\u0026#8217t think I could do anymore. It felt like that was totally ruled out – how can you climb without legs?\u0026#8220But they sent me some links to some really inspirational paraplegics, who were during climbing but in an adaptive way. Ordinarilly, climbing with two legs is like puzzle solving where you pick a route and decide what will work for you and that\u0026#8217s what I used to love.\u0026#8220When climbing in an adaptive way, you don\u0026#8217t get any of that puzzle solving and when people first spoke to me about climbing in that way I thought it wasn\u0026#8217t really the same so I wouldn\u0026#8217t want to do it. For me it was never about getting to the top of something, it was about the journey and figuring stuff out.\u0026#8220Climbing something in an adaptive way uses a pulley system and you haul your weight up. I thought there was no puzzle to that \u0026#8211 how wrong I was. I\u0026#8217ve not even attempted this climb yet and it\u0026#8217s been the biggest puzzle in the world. Creating the equipment has been the biggest challenge and finding people who have the ideas to make the equipment, it\u0026#8217s a never-ending puzzle.\u0026#8221To donate or find out more about Michelle\u0026#8217s challenge visit the website www.routetothesky\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Within the 12 weeks of attending Fair Start Scotland, not only can Alan now use Microsoft Outlook, but he has completed his new CV on Microsoft Word and has been applying online for employment.In all the group workshops that Alan attends, he socialises very well with the other participants and is very cheerful. He thinks the service is going very well, and is enjoying it. Alan is very happy with the progress he has made, and has noticed the improvement in his confidence.Alan seems to be talking so much more, which may have been a barrier stopping him from getting into work. He was pleased to inform his Fair Start Scotland adviser that he got a job working 15 hours a week.Alan said: “I’ve attended workshops on confidence building, and digital skills at Lochaber Hope. My confidence is improving a lot and so are my computer skills. I have been job searching online and sending emails — I couldn’t do this before. I am enjoying working with my Fair Start Scotland adviser, Cameron.” 100vw, 1052px\" /\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

When the kirk on the shores of Lochbroom was put up for sale by the Church of Scotland back in 2016, it\u0026rsquos future looked uncertain.A determined local fundraising drive saw it eventually taken into community ownership by locals who see it as a key hub in the beautiful, remote area.Celia said: \"We saw how well Donnie Mackenzie\u0026rsquos fundraiser for Clachan did and the huge boost it gave everyone involved. Sara and I thought we would enjoy getting fitter, seeing more of our country, and help Clachan at the same time. Since our local Trust became owners on June 22 we straightaway saw the difference it has made to our community. It has become a community focus right from the start.\"With the doors open more often we know there\u0026rsquos someone there and stop for a chat. For those of us living on the no-through road on the west shore of Loch Broom, we pass Clachan every time we go anywhere so it is ideal.\"\"When Clachan opened during the Lochbroom Sheepdog Trials, the trust displayed some local produce, from handloom weaving, cards, honey, handmade books and paintings, to show the range of economic activity in Lochbroom. That is the tip of the iceberg. There\u0026rsquos only a small population but there\u0026rsquos a huge number of people producing high-quality goods \u0026ndash having their work displayed in a public building helps everybody.\"Sara and I are confident that Clachan will be an asset to the Lochbroom community for many years to come so we are asking for sponsorship. This can be done at the New Broom hub in Ullapool and by emailing me at celiajcharity@me. Thank you.\"Kenneth Macleod, an interim trustee of Clachan Lochbroom Heritage Trust, said: \"I have seen the benefit that grows from rescuing a building, improving it and making it available for wider purposes. Of course Clachan continues for the usual church occasions \u0026ndash we want everyone to know that! \u0026ndash whilst extending its usefulness for other appropriate purposes.\"Thursday 13 Sep 2018 4:08 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Health Secretary Jeane Feeman has apologised for distressed caused by the delay.            Women in Scotland are invited for routine breast screening between the ages of 50 and 70.According to a statement from the Scottish Government, the women affected were not invited for their final appointment by the time they had turned 70 as a result of delays within the programme.The length of time the women affected have waited for their final appointments ranges from three years to a few months.NHS screening centres have made arrangements to screen the women as quickly as possible, and additional staff are in place to answer phone enquiries and provide reassurance and support. The additional screening will not delay other women attending their routine appointments.Read more: Breast screening programme to be reviewed The review was carried out by the Scottish Clinical Taskforce after the previous Health Secretary, Shona Robison, asked for further due diligence checks on the breast screening programme following separate issues in England announced by Public Health England in May this year.

This additional screening will not delay other women attending their routine appointments. “This issue came to light following a due diligence review of the breast screening system in Scotland which was undertaken after a significant incident with England’s breast screening programme earlier this year.

The regulations state information should be accessible on a host of matters including the subjects available to pupils and the performance of the school at local and national level.Ms Davidson said Professor Scott\u0027s analysis would show only seven per cent of schools make information on curriculum and attainment readily available while 20 per cent do not meet any of the requirements outlined in the regulations.“Schools should, according to this government\u0027s own rules, give parents clear data on the curriculum and on performance,” Ms Davidson said.\"That\u0027s so parents can find out about the school they are entrusting their children with or, where appropriate, make an informed decision about which school to choose.\"Yet, according to Professor Scott, six years on the parent who wishes to make an informed choice of school has relatively little chance of doing so when more than nine out of ten schools fail to publish the information this parliament requires of them.\"            Read more: Scots primary one pupils left crying by `cruel\u0027 national testingMs Sturgeon insisted while there was a \"wide range of information available to parents about the performance of schools\", ministers wanted to do more, adding \"that is why we have introduced standardised assessments to replace the assessments that were previously under way by local authorities\"The First Minister revealed that the Tories were going to bring forward a Holyrood motion next week for the abolition of primary one testing.Read more: Scots P1 tests to be overhauled but not axedShe said Ms Davidson was guilty of “breath-taking hypocrisy” as she quoted from the Tory 2016 Holyrood election manifesto, which welcomed the reintroduction of national testing in primary schools.\"What we see from the Conservatives is that they are shameless opportunists, they do not care,” Ms Sturgeon said.            \"They care only about the short-term political opportunity, they care not a jot about the school children, they care not a jot about standards in our schools, I think Ruth Davidson has revealed that yet again today.\"The SNP leader said: \"I want to see parents have more information about the performance of their children, that is why we have standardised the assessments that were previously in place, including at P1, in order that we are ensuring that teachers know whether young people are meeting the benchmarks set by Curriculum for Excellence.\"Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie, who raised the same issue at First Minister\u0027s Questions, accused Ms Sturgeon of refusing to listen to teachers and the teaching union the EIS on the issue of P1 testing."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4798951.1536819027!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp activists to hold day of action on independence referendum","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The SNP is to hold a national \u0026#8220day of action\u0026#8221 on Scottish independence later this month, taking the temperature of the nation as it continues its preparations for a second referendum.                The party’s depute leader Keith Brown said MPs, MSPs and activists would be given a target of speaking to 50,000 people across the country on 29 September.            Revealing the plans in an interview with The Scotsman’s sister title inews, he said the party would be “making the case for an independent Scotland” on the doorsteps by mobilising its sizeable membership.            Earlier this month it was confirmed that the SNP had become the UK’s second largest political party, with 125,000 members to the Conservatives’ 124,000.Mr Brown said the day of action would allow the SNP to take a “huge sample of public opinion”, arguing that the time was right to make the case for independence given the “chaos of Brexit”.Citing a recent poll which found that Brexit could sway support in favour of Scottish independence, Mr Brown said he wanted activists to “mine that seam” by talking to voters.“What’s really important now is taking that message out, right in the teeth of the chaos of Brexit, to put forward our proposition of why we believe Scotland should be independent,” he said.While the party has been running street stalls to attract the attention of voters, taking its message onto the doorsteps marks a step up in its preparations for another referendum on independence.            However, Mr Brown also suggested that plans for a re-run of 2014’s vote may have to be pushed back if the timetable for the Brexit negotiations slips.“It’s not fair to confront people with another constitutional question when the constitutional question of Brexit is as yet unresolved,” he said.SNP activists will be instructed to seek voters’ views on the Growth Commission report, which attempted to reboot the economic case for independence, as well as other issues.“People just now are seeing things like their mortgages going up because interest rates are going up, the cost of food is going up, they’re hearing stories about potential food shortages, about huge queues at the borders, they’re seeing the Tory party tearing themselves apart,” Mr Brown added.            “These things do tend to change the political environment: the perceived competence or otherwise of a government and the extent to which it’s seen to be in control of events is a big factor for people. We want to find out how people are feeling about that.”The day of action is also part of the SNP’s preparations for a possible snap general election, with Mr Brown revealing that the vetting process for new candidates is already well under way. “This is putting people on the streets, which is really important. With 50-odd Tory MPs talking about taking out the Prime Minister and installing another leader, and the manoeuvres that Boris [Johnson] is on, it seemed a sensible idea.”Scottish Conservative chief whip Maurice Golden said the day of action would merely remind Scots that the SNP “continues to obsess over one thing” at the expense of the nation."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the life of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

Moreover having these as resort destinations for the congested central european market would certainly dent the deficit but they are fighting Edinburgh empire building politicians who are happy to sacrifice Glasgow\u0026#8217s two dromes ,whilst not giving Aberdeen even the chance to compete across the pond . Hail is not the problem its the remote distant politicians in Edinburgh that are the problem.\nI assume that Icelandair and Atlantic Air have made conscious decisions not to make stops at Scotland airports because of cost or governmental restrictions.\nAtlantic Air flies Airbus A319  and Airbus A320 . Icelandair flies similar Boeing aircraft. Runways at Sumburgh and Wick are not long enough.

Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notified by letter.\nThursday 13 Sep 2018 4:09 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117295.jpg","title":"Lack of 999 cover for busy Harley weekend","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nAVIEMORE was covered by only a single-manned ambulance for most of the Harley Davidson Thunder in the Glens rally, it has emerged.\nIt means that a casualty could be attended to but not taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the event of an emergency until a second ambulance crew had arrived at the scene.\nIt is understood the village only had an ambulance with single crew rather than double crew available last Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday until 5pm.\nThere were an estimated 3000 motorcyclists in the area for the UK\u0027s biggest Harley rally.\nGMB Scotland also said Kingussie only had a single manned crew in operation from just after midnight on Thursday until Sunday morning.\nThe union said the situation is simply not acceptable and poses a real danger.\nAlong with the Strathy, the GMB has been calling for the Scottish Ambulance Service to get rid of the current on-call system and to replace it with 24/7 shifts to bring the Aviemore base into line with most other stations in Scotland.\nJohn Marr, GMB branch secretary, said: \"Only a first responder service would have been able to be provided by an ambulance with single crew.\n\"This would have involved looking after the casualty at the location until back up arrived.\n\"We think it is dangerous and we are stepping up our calls on the government to provide the Scottish Ambulance Service with the funds required to give Badenoch and Strathspey the service the area deserves.\n\"At the moment we are going round in circles asking why there is no 24/7 cover despite Aviemore being one of the busiest tourism spots in the whole of Scotland.\n\"We have repeatedly informed the Scottish Ambulance Service that this is a dangerous situation but nothing is happening.\"\nHighland Council convener and local councillor Bill Lobban, said: \"The current level of ambulance cover is clearly completely unacceptable.\n\"Given our population added to the huge number of visitors we see on a daily basis the Scottish Ambulance Service needs to make sure we have sufficient staff on duty to provide a safe and effective service.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit.

This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects. The overall result for GCSE English for the whole cohort was 80% in the A – C range, with the overall Mathematics result being almost 60%: in each case this represented the best outcomes in the school’s history. \n  \nOverall, almost 80% of students achieved 5 or more subjects in the A – C range with almost 60% achieving this standard inclusive of English and Maths. This significantly exceeds the National and Northern Ireland averages and places our school and is testimony to the success which can be attained at a non-selective school. \n  \n Many factors contribute to such success, not least the support of parents, the commitment of students and the motivational teaching which is inspirational yet grounded, and which proves that high expectations enable students to push boundaries and indeed predictions. \n  \nSubjects which achieved the outstanding success rate of 100% of pupils gaining Grade C or better were as follows: Art, Construction, Media Studies, Double Award Science, Occupational Studies, Further Maths, Prince’s Trust, Agriculture \u0026amp Community Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

Northern Ireland and, indeed, across the world as a fundraising campaign was launched to help fund his treatment as part of a clinical trial in Mexico. \n\nFor a time it appeared the treatment was bearing fruit, unfortunately over the following months his condition worsened until just a few weeks ago the family warned ‘his journey was near over’. \n\nHis battle began in January 2017 when the youngster was diagnosed with an inoperable Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma also known as ‘DIPG’ which is the second most common type of primary, high grade brain tumour in children. \n\nWhile the outlook was grim his family refused to give up and they discovered a pioneering treatment in Mexico. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn September last year they travelled from their home in Waringstown near Lurgan to Mexico in a bid to save his life. \n\nThe Cure4Cam fundraising page was set up with in excess of £100,000 raised to pay for his treatment thanks to incredible support coming from Northern Ireland and beyond.\n\nRead more by \nclicking here\n.\n\n                            \n

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Lifeguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital life skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lifesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8634555.1536848138!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n            \n                                      \t   \nEducation\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n if  .each ,             imgUrl = wrapper.find.data         if  \u0027                 .                 .children.hide               \n\t        \n            \n                      \n                                    \n                    \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n                    \n                \n                    St Mary\u0026rsquos say goodbye to Mr Timothy Doyle                \n            \n            \n                \n\nSt Mary\u0026#8217s Primary School, Banbridge, was shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of their much esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Timothy Doyle. \n            \n                                        \t\nNews\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n if  .each ,                    imgUrl = wrapper.find.data            if  \u0027                        .                        .                        .children.hide                        \n                \n                                                \n                    \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n                    \n                \n                    Education Authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols                \n            \n            \n                \n\nThe Education Authority  has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland return to school in the coming days.\n            \n                                        \t\nEducation\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n if  .each ,                    imgUrl = wrapper.find.data            if  \u0027                        .                        .                        .children.hide                        \n                \n                        \n                                              \n            \n                                  \n                                    \n                    \n            \n        , Sinead Sweeney  Jack Rice , Christopher Beattie , Amy Gray    and Shannon Ferguson  have all been selected to take part in prestigious British Council programme, and will spend a year studying business in the USA.

high pupils hailed for exam successes","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n\n                \nPrincipal Ian McConaghy hailed the students and said their achievements, particularly at A Level, were down to a team effort.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAddresssing the class of 2018, he said: “To our leavers and year 14 pupils, this recognition of achievement is our chance to put you in the spotlight and say ‘well done’,‘congratulations’ and ‘best wishes’ for the next stage of your lives, to all of you.  It is right and fitting that your families join us for this occasion since achieving success in education and particularly at A level, is indeed a team effort”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the examination results Mr McConaghy continued “The results this year are excellent 87% of all the grades achieved were A*-C and all subjects were passed with no fails at all. These results are a tremendous credit to everyone involved and reflect highly on the sixth from provision here in Dromore High.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“There are so many success stories I could mention, but for tremendous achievements I would highlight Zara Malcolmson and Charles Wright our top two pupils with 3 A* and 3A grades between them, but in truth I could carry on down the list to include many, many more all of whom worked really hard and succeeded. As per our ethos we value the achievements of every single pupil who has done their best, worked hard and succeeded”.\n\nMr McConaghy had a special welcome for retired teacher Miss Hazel Uprichard, a member of the Senior Leadership Team and Head of Science who retired in August after 33 years of dedicated service and loyalty to Dromore High, wishing her well for her retirement.\n\nCommenting on the make up of the school’s sixth form Mr McConaghy said “a considerable number of pupils join our sixth form from other schools.These pupils are an extremely welcome addition to our sixth form transferring typically from Rathfriland High School, and other schools in the locality. These pupils settled in Dromore High extremely well and they brought some new perspectives and a fresh balance to the sixth form.  \n\n“We are delighted they chose to study here and their results are an affirmation of their choice. Two of them were chosen as Head Prefects, Deputy Head Girl Zara Malcolmson and Deputy Head Boy David Whiteside.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReviewing the leavers destinations,’ Mr McConaghy indicated that approximately 20% of them were going to the UK mainland to continue their third level studies with the majority choosing to go to local universities. He said degree courses being undertaken in Accounting, Agriculture, Archaeology, Business, Biomedical Science, Communication, Economics Education, Engineering, Geography, Human Nutrition, IT, International relations and politics, Law, Mathematics, Nursing, Pharmacy, Psychology and Sport.\n\nMr McConaghy added: “Six of our pupils have secured Higher Level Apprenticeships in Accounting, Mechanical Engineering and Luke Edgar secured an IT apprenticeship with worldwide multinational firm Google. He takes up his position in London this month”.\n\nHe paid tribute to the staff for their commitment in curricular and extra-curricular activities, mentioning in particular the very broad and beneficial Enrichment programme for sixth form pupils which helps prepare them for the next stage of their career. All of this helps us as we seek to continue to educate our students to look upon themselves as global, rather than as parochial, citizens, and be able to assess risk, analyse world affairs intelligently and adapt accordingly. \n\n“Additionally, into year 13 this year we have admitted almost 100 pupils which again is a most encouraging intake and a vote of confidence by the local community and those from further afield in our sixth form”.  \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the disappointing lack of political progress in Northern Ireland, Mr McConaghy nonetheless offered his thanks to several local politicians for their ongoing support for the school “away from the spotlight”, in particular Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who “continues to advocate strongly on our behalf concerning our critical need for a new school building and the lack of places for pupils in year 8”. Mr McConaghy urged a strengthening of political support for the needs of the school at this critical time. \n\n“It is said that ‘self-praise is no recommendation’ however I feel it is my duty to heap praise on my staff and all those involved in educating this group of leavers. This school and it’s staff does a magnificent job and I offer as evidence to support that claim this tremendous group of young adults who are a credit to themselves, their families and this school.\n\n“Finally I would say to our leavers group, we don’t wish this to be your last event with your school. Join our alumni group being set up this year by Mrs Mitchell and keep in touch. Even though your formal education here is now complete we can be of assistance to each other. Be proud of this school wherever you study and wherever you ultimately find yourselves. We remain here to help should you ever need help in any way. My sincerest best wishes to you all.”\n\nGuest speaker Miss Claire Beckett BSc reflected on her time in Dromore High which she had enjoyed tremendously. Claire had always faced the challenge of combining a love of study with a love of farming. \n\nVery early morning starts to complete her work on the family farm near Donaghcloney preceded her busy days in school before returning to the farm for more work. Claire had enjoyed both aspects of her life tremendously. Early in life she knew that she wanted to work with animals and identified a gap in the knowledge of effective nutrition for cattle. Her education had prepared her for this and she was now pursuing this through her career with her employer Trouw Nutrition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nClaire advised the pupils to commit to the highest levels of study now even if they did not have a final destination in mind at this stage.\n\nIt was important to balance all one’s endeavours in life and realise that sometimes some things have to be sacrificed for long term benefit, even if it is difficult at the time. Her advice was to “work hard at whatever is right in front of you at the time”.\n\nClaire had been influenced by a number of people in her life to good effect including her family and her teachers and she paid tribute to them. Reiterating wise words given to her that “if you enjoy your job you never work a day in your life”. She urged the pupils to work hard and pursue their dreams that they may enjoy their careers also.\n\nDuring the celebration, two musical items provided entertainment for the audience, a vocal solo by Sophie Tate accompanied by her grandfather Mr Donald McClernan on acoustic guitar, ‘Song Bird’ and a piano solo by Erin McNally entitled ‘A Steady Hand’\n\nChairman Mrs Woods thanked Claire for her inspirational speech and for presenting the certificates, prizes and cups to the recipients. Mrs Woods concluded the celebration by reiterating her pride in the pupils and the school “wishing all the pupils well on the next stage of their journey” wherever it was leading them.\n\nSEE NEXT WEEK’S LEADER FOR A PICTORIAL ROUND UP OF THE DAY.\n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8630052.1536655628!/image/image.jpg","title":"final blueprints for re drawing ni s political map revealed","story":"\nThe Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland has just published its final blueprints for how the Province\u0026#8217s political map will be redrawn.\n\n                \nOne key element is that a 2016 proposal to reduce Belfast’s current four constituencies to three has been definitively scrapped.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nFinal boundary revision proposals, published by Boundary Commission NI, 10-09-18.

After the Act of Remembrance, Bro Ward laid a wreath at the Herron family memorial plaque which was unveiled on the boundary wall of Dromore Orange Hall in April 2016 and is the only tangible memorial in Dromore to the history of the Troubles.  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTown draper, William Herron , his wife Elizabeth  and daughter Noeline  died in the blaze after an incendiary device was planted in their Market Square drapery store in April 1976. The fire destroyed much of the shop and the family home above it, where the three victims died from suffocation. Bro William Herron was a member of Closkelt LOL 415 in Rathfriland District LOL No 3.\n\n* A series of commemorative events also took place across Northern Ireland last weekend as the Institution marked its inaugural Orange Victims Day. The Loyal Order formally remember the 335 Orangemen and one Orangewoman murdered by terrorists during the Troubles. The day, which will become an annual event, also highlighted the ongoing plight of the injured and bereaved.\n\n\n   \n                 .

It was this love of numeracy that led Timothy to establish Maths Improvement NI, a programme to support good practice in the teaching of maths. This was disseminated throughout schools in Northern Ireland with great success.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTimothy had a love for children and had their best interests at heart. He was able to engage easily with his pupils and use his talents to help them reach their potential. His sense of humour and fun was shared and enjoyed by the children of St Mary’s. Timothy instilled in his pupils many of the values that he held dear respect, good manners, fairness, courtesy and decency, to name a few!\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTimothy was an avid supporter of Gaelic Games. He was an enthusiastic GAA coach in St Mary’s and loved the success his teams achieved at school and county level. Alongside Clann Na Banna, he established the “Gaelic League” in 1991 and its legacy continues today. Due to his influence and encouragement, many were attracted to Gaelic games, who otherwise may not have been.\n\nTimothy left a lasting impression upon all those who made his acquaintance, in both his personal and professional life. He was a true gentleman with a kind and caring heart and had the talent of making others feel at ease. Timothy made time for everyone and was undoubtedly the ‘life and soul’ of many a school outing and staff celebration. His presence will be greatly missed. His colleagues and friends cherish fond memories of the ‘yarns’ and ‘craic’ they shared. He was an inspiration to everyone and the school feels truly blessed to have know him: ‘You will be forever in our hearts.’ \n\n“He kept at true good humour’s mark, the social flow of pleasure’s tide. He never made a brow look dark, nor caused a tear, but when he died.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8629133.1536492348!/image/image.jpg","title":"ulster and ireland rugby star rory best given freedom honour","story":"\nSome of the biggest names from the world of rugby union gathered at the Archbishop\u0026#8217s Palace in Armagh to witness Rory Best\u0026#8217s conferment with the Freedom of the Borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon.\n\n                \nThe lord Mayor, alderman and councillors awarded the honour to the Ulster, Ireland and Lions rugby star – only the second-ever granted - on Saturday to recognise his huge contribution to both sport and the community in the borough.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nRory Best celebrates receiving the freedom of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n The ceremony, hosted by BBC rugby commentator Jim Neilly, saw Rory accept the Freedom Scroll from the Lord Mayor and sign the Book of Honorary Burgesses.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n As well as family and friends of Rory Best and members of council, attendees included rugby stars Conor Murray, David Wallace, Mike Ross and Andrew Trimble, and a host of others.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n Dr Rory Best OBE said: “To receive the Freedom of the Borough is such a great honour, particularly as it comes from the area where I grew up, where I learned my rugby and where I live. This borough has given so much to me over the years and I am thankful to everybody who has helped me throughout my rugby career so far.\n\n “I would like to thank the council for considering me for this honour and for arranging today’s very special event. I have had the privilege to take part in some memorable sporting occasions and today’s will live long in the memory with the best of them.”\n\n Earlier in the day Rory attended a special Festival of Rugby held at City of Armagh Rugby Club made up of teams from clubs across the borough including Banbridge RFC, Dromore RFC, Lurgan RFC, Portadown RFC and City of Armagh RFC, as well as rugby neighbours Dungannon RFC and Monaghan RFC.  Portadown Panthers opened the festival with an exhibition game of tag rugby, of which Rory is the club patron.\n\n Lord Mayor Julie Flaherty said: “Today has been a real celebration of Rory Best’s sporting achievements and the contribution he makes to our borough. He thoroughly deserves the Freedom of the Borough honour and we could ask for no better example for our young people to follow, both on and off the pitch.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n “The fantastic turnout from the world of provincial and international rugby is testament to the regard with which Rory is held in the professional game, as are the tributes from some of the stalwarts of the game.”\n\n Dr Rory Best OBE received the Freedom of the Borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon in recognition of his outstanding sporting achievements of a local man who was raised and educated in Poyntzpass and went to Tandragee Junior High and Portadown College. He played rugby for Banbridge and his wife Jodie teaches in The Armstrong Primary School, Armagh.\n\n Rory has won a raft of honours in the rugby world, including captaining Ulster, Ireland and the British and Irish Lions earning more than 100 caps for Ireland and more than 200 for Ulster leading Ireland to a third Grand Slam and Triple Crown in 2018 also leading Ireland to historic wins over the New Zealand All Blacks, South Africa and Australia and being part of the Ulster side which reached a Heineken Cup final in 2012.\n\n As part of the Freedom of the Borough celebrations, some of Rory’s most memorable items from his playing career are on display in a special exhibition in the Archbishop’s Palace in Armagh\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nItems on display include the match ball from the Ireland rugby team’s historic win over the New Zealand All Blacks in Chicago in 2016 Rory’s shirt from the Six Nations Championship Grand Slam winning game against England in 2018 the boots worn by the hooker on his 200th cap for Ulster in 2017 and his captain’s shirt from the Lions game against the Chiefs on the tour of New Zealand in 2017.\n\nThe exhibition is open until Sunday, September 16 from 10am to 5pm and 7pm to 9pm on weekdays and 2pm to 5pm at weekends, it will be closed on Saturday 8th September and Wednesday 12th September.

However, on Botanic Avenue, which is especially popular with students, business owners begin to feel the pinch as the University term ends in December.\nRichard Walker, owner of The Other Place on Botanic’s thoroughfare, said that extending the Christmas lights would not only improve trade, but also the festive atmosphere in South Belfast.\n“Botanic Avenue is usually a very vibrant and busy area, but what we have discovered over the last couple of years is that when the Christmas lights are put up and the Christmas market comes that a lot of our customers want to go down into the city centre,” he said.\n“They want to be part of the buzz and the festivities. On Botanic Avenue we notice a lull in trade around that time.\n“We are very busy with the students returning around September up until November time. As soon as it gets close to Christmas time there is a massive downturn in trade.\n“People are going into the city centre because they want to be part of the fun. The economy is very poor at the minute and a lot of restaurants are really struggling so we rely on Christmas to help our performance throughout the year, because come January when everybody has spent their money eating out is the last thing they want to do. It puts us under a lot of pressure.”\nHe continued: “Festivals and events like the Christmas market are great for the local economy, but in Botanic Avenue and the Ormeau where we aren’t part of the city festive programme we see a drop in footfall.\n“With the tourist boom that we’ve had over the summer, we’ve seen that a lot of tourists are getting off the train at Botanic train station, and with the opening of the Grand Central Hotel, they are walking up Botanic Avenue, going to the Ulster Museum and Botanic Park. I would like that to be part of the route map for Christmas, so that we can keep that going.\n“I have spoken to a lot of local traders here and they are all very much of the same mindset. We want Botanic and Ormeau to be part of the Christmas spirit –It’s good craic. My staff would certainly like to be coming to work seeing the Christmas lights and getting into the spirit. I think it’s a good idea for local traders and the local residents too.”\nBotanic Councillor Declan Boyle said that bringing the festivities to the area is “great idea”.\n“The Christmas market is  good but I think we need to spread people out to other parts of the city too,” said.\n“The business owners pay rates and they should be given a bit of help and assistance. In Botanic Avenue their market, by and large, is university students and in the middle of December when they go it’s very quiet, so it would do no harm to help out those businesses there.\n“For the rest of the year it’s a thriving place, it has a great bohemian mix, so I think the area should be assisted in the Christmas months. It’s only a small stretch of road, and it wouldn’t have a terrible expense attached to it, so I would be very much in favour of it.”\n________________________________________\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"celebrating irish language","story":"\n\nNOMINATIONS\n are still open for The Outstanding Contribution to the Irish Language Award in this year’s Aisling Awards.\n\nThis award celebrates the vibrancy and uniqueness which the Irish language brings to the city of Belfast, the award will honour an organisation or person who works tirelessly to pioneer the language.

Visitors were treated to displays from traditional musicians, the Colin Men’s Shed, Belfast Beekeeper’s Association, and, of course, the gardeners themselves.\nThis year’s harvest produced a colourful cornucopia of fruit and veg – a beautiful, healthy and tasty reward for all of the allotment owners’ hard graft.\nMichael George, from Colin Neighbourhood Partnership, hailed their success, stating it was “the best year yet” for the allotments.\n“This is all great produce from the allotment holders themselves and we have local honey from the hives on site,” he said.\n“We have all of these different organisations here giving advice and information about growing and sustainable living.\n“This is a very important project for the Colin area because it’s helping local people grow their own vegetables, and stay healthy. We want to promote sustainable living. With Brexit coming along, fruit and vegetables are getting dearer every day.\n“I have a plot here myself and I’ve eaten the vegetables from the plot all summer. It’s a money saver, it’s organic, you can taste the difference and it keeps you healthy too.”\nHe continued: “I couldn’t get over the displays. The last couple of years have been good, but this is the best year yet. The community are really into it – it’s a great celebration.”\nBelfast’s first citizen, Cllr Deirdre Hargey, who came along to judge the stunning displays, said: “It’s a brilliant day. When you’re up here and you see the scale of the allotments in the Colin area it’s amazing. It’s brilliant for the city, it’s brilliant for the community and our young people.\n“It teaches people to grow their own food – healthier food, more natural food – and encouraging people to actually eat fruit and veg.\n“You can see that the demand for this community activity is growing too.\n“It’s particularly important when you look at the health issues in the city relating to diet including obesity. This helps change the culture of unhealthy eating.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the community group that took on a giant","story":"\n\nMONEY\n breeds power, or so the idiom goes, but five years ago when plans were revealed for a quarter-billion pound waste incinerator in Glengormley, it sparked a grassroots community campaign that would go on to take on big capital and even the government.\nThe NoArc21 campaign started when a small group of concerned residents called a public meeting to voice their concerns about Becon Consortium’s plans to build an incinerator near homes on the Hightown Road.\nVice-chair of NoArc21, Charlie Thompson, said the danger posed by the incinerator and the anger caused by it was enough to mobilise the community.\n“The anger was bad because at that stage there was problems with the dump in Mallusk and the smells coming from the incinerator down there,” he said.\n“This area was very much seen as a dumping ground. It was like we were living in the middle of a tip. The actual incinerator would be right outside my windows. I would be looking at it every day if it was to go ahead.\n“We were told lies about the size of it too. We were told it would be all hidden and that we wouldn’t even notice it. This thing is going to be the size of Wembley Stadium or Croke Park and it’s supposed to be less than a half a mile from my front windows – I think I would see the thing.\n“I was very angry at the size and scale of it, but there is evidence out there now that these things cause cancer. The size can’t be underestimated either – it will be the single biggest freestanding building in Northern Ireland.\n“It will have a chimney stack that’s over 90 metres long. The evidence all says anyone living up to a kilometre-and-a-half away will be those worse affected. This thing is going to be pouring toxins over my family, my neighbours and everybody within a kilometre at best, but at worse the catchment area could be 15k. Almost all of the Belfast basin will be inhaling this and it’s already one of the most polluted cities in Europe, in terms of air pollution. This is just going to make it worse.”\nHe continued: “As soon as I got involved there was a small committee set up and we identified all the problems that could be associated with it.\n“After the waste is burned there is a substance left over called fly-ash, which is extremely toxic. If any of the lorries carrying it were involved in an accident, and this is a busy road, then all of that would be released into the air.\n“This is in an expanding residential area. The impact on that is huge.\n“We have evidence as well that it would reduce house prices. We estimated that it would reduce house prices by ten to 20 per cent, but we now have people who have come forward who can’t get a mortgage on their homes because there is a negative equity risk.\n“The evidence is very, very clear this causes lung infections, cancers, and lung conditions. While the incinerator complies with existing legal policies and regulations, they have never ever said it was safe.\n“Any opportunity I have had with Arc21 I have asked them if they could stand up in front of the public and say that the facility is safe. They have never said that – they have said it complies with existing policies and regulations, but those are already out of date, and are being reviewed as we speak.”\nWhile the anger amongst residents was palpable during the foundation of the NoArc21 campaign, Charlie said that channelling those energies and sustaining the group has been “extremely tough”.\n“Because of the threat it was easy at times to get people on board, but the issue is sustaining the campaign,” he explained.\n“We had a problem with apathy. When Mark H Durkan was environment minister he shot dead the application, and people thought it was dead in the water. We then had to go to the Planning Appeals Commission and we lost.\n“That said, in the history of Northern Ireland this has had the most objections to any planning application – over 4,000 people have gone to the trouble of submitting an objection.\n“The other thing that has helped us is that we are cross-community. We have been approached by all parties who have offered us assistance, but we have been very careful that we don’t side with one over another. Our group is mixed in terms of background. It doesn’t just impact on any one side of the community. This has been key to us.\n“We have secured funding through online crowdfunding, and people have been very good on that, people have thrown money in buckets for us – it all helps.”\nBy being able to recruit a legal team, NoArc21 were able to challenge the legality of the decision to grant planning permission for the incinerator earlier this year. The High Court ruled the Department for Infrastructure did not have the authority to grant permission in the absence of a minister. Charlie said that the group were “happy and shocked” by the decision, but said that they still might have a fight on their hands.\n“We’re a small community group, so this is all new to us,” he stated.\n“We didn’t think for a minute that we would win – we were hoping that we would win and we were fighting from every angle. We pulled in experts who were offering free advice and services.\n“When we heard the High Court Ruling we were delighted. We had a very strong legal team, but we were still very surprised. We always knew that this facility was wrong in this area.\n“Fighting it legally for us was a big challenge for us and we may have to do it again. The Department for Infrastructure won’t appeal, but the Attorney General submitted a series of questions that could affect the High Court decision.\n“I’m not going to say that we didn’t expect the decision to have huge ramifications, but we didn’t think that it would stall the governing of Northern Ireland. There are so many things that are held up because of this. With the Attorney General submitting those questions, there’s a chance that this will go to the Supreme Court in London, and that’s something that we have to prepare for.”\nHe added: “We are optimistic, however, if we lose on one issue this could be enough to put this back to a decision for a minister to take, whether that be a direct rule minister, or if Stormont is back up and running.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ballymurphy massacre documentary maker macrae defends film as providing balance to false official narrative","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They included a priest attending to those wounded and a mother of eight.\n\nIn the documentary it heard how that mother, Joan Connolly, lay crying on the ground until she passed away.\n\nAnother man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the estate.\n\nThe shootings took place as the Army moved in to republican strongholds to arrest IRA suspects in the wake of the introduction of the controversial policy of internment without trial.\n\nSoldiers have long been held responsible for killing the 10 people in Ballymurphy but the accepted narrative became clouded earlier this year when former UVF members came forward to claim their organisation was also involved.\n\nInquests into the deaths are due to open in November.\n\n\n \nDate set for new inquest into Ballymurphy massacre\n \n\n\nFilmmaker Callum Macrae, rejected criticism the piece did not tell \"the whole story\" in that it did not go into the context of the major gun battles around the time or give the \"full context\" about the actions of paramilitaries including the IRA at the time.\n\nHe said: \"The description - which is widely held by people in the UK - that Protestants and Catholics were at each others throats, the Provisional IRA was an incredibly dangerous force rushing around killing people and the British Army was sent in as the patsies, the guys in the middle, trying to restore order and peace - that is the official narrative, it is accepted by almost everybody in Britain - and it is simply not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelfast IRA men with a drogue bomb in 1987\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I tell people the Provisional IRA did not exist until several months after the Army arrived, they are astonished. Because there is a false narrative. \n\n\"So to describe what I am doing as some kind of false unbalanced narrative is just simply wrong.\n\n\"My film actually is the balance to the official narrative which is fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nMr Macrae said \"of course the IRA\" were active at the time of the Ballymurphy massacre. \n\n\"The British Army described very clearly a \u0027major gun battle\u0027, with upwards of 700 rounds being fired at soldiers. The Army, specifically in a statement to the Belfast , claimed there were 20 gunmen coming down from the top of the hill onto the Whiterock Road and the Army fought a two-hour battle involving Thompson sub-machine guns, pistols and rifles.\"\n\nHe said the reports from the time - based on what the British Army had said happened - although \"well-intentioned\" were \"transparently untrue\".\n\n\"They talk about wiping out a \u0027hardcore IRA unit\u0027,\" he went on.\n\n\"Now I have been looking into this for four years and there is not a shred of credible evidence I can find to say any of that is true.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let me be clear - I am no apologist for the IRA. \n\n\"No one can say there was no IRA present - I am certainly not saying that. \n\n\"What we can say for sure is no one can say for certain there were no armed paramilitaries present. And we do mention the UVF claim.\n\n\"We said most of the IRA had been tipped off and most of their members had left, that\u0027s what the IRA claimed.\"\n\nQuoting Gerry Adams who claimed a \"small number\" of IRA remained to offer \"token resistance\", Mr Mccrae said there were no guns found, ammunition or shells and two of those killed had been shot in the back.\n\n\"Not for a second do I deny the IRA were there,\" he added.\n\n\"What the army claim is \u0027a large number of IRA were involved with sub machine guns\u0027. I have looked very hard for four years and can not find evidence of it. \n\n\"Nonetheless - even though I can\u0027t find evidence of it, does not mean it didn\u0027t happen.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast road is most clamped street in northern ireland drivers spend 34k to","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

road is in Belfast is the most clamped street or road in Northern Ireland, new figures have revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nDepartment for Infrastructure statistics show 16 vehicles were clamped on the Lisburn Road between the start of 2016 and the end of June this year.\n\nIt was almost double the number of clampings carried out on Chichester Street, Northern Ireland\u0027s second most clamped street.\n\nBotanic Avenue, Great Victoria Street, and King Street all had eight clampings each.\n\nBetween January 2016 and June of this year Northern Ireland\u0027s motorists paid out £34,581 to have clamps removed from their cars.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u0027s 10 most clamped roads and streets were all in the Belfast City Council area.\n\nIn 2016 there were 254 cars clamped in Northern Ireland, 305 cars were clamped in 2017, and 91 cars were clamped in the first six months of 2018.\n\nIn Northern Ireland there are two reasons to clamp a car.\n\nAction can be taken for an unpaid penalty charge notice, or against vehicles parked in urban clearways and bus lanes.\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Infrastructure said clamping had been an effective measure to prevent traffic offences.\n\nClamping was introduced for cars parked in urban clearways and bus lanes on March 5.\n\nBetween that date and the end of June 35 cars were clamped and removed for that reason.\n\nThe rule was introduced to stop motorists blocking the main arteries into Belfast by parking illegally.\n\nEnforcement is carried out for the Department for Infrastructure by contractor NSL Services Group.\n\nDrivers are required to pay a charge of £40 to have a clamp removed if the car has been removed to a nearby street, or £105 if the car has been taken to the vehicle pound .\n\nSpeaking at the time of the launch of the measure, Ciaran de Burca, Department for Infrastructure director of transport projects, said: \"Vehicles parked in urban clearway routes and bus lanes during operational hours cause significant delays and congestion for commuters and other road users, particularly during the morning and evening peak traffic hours.\n\n\"For drivers who choose to ignore urban clearway and bus lane regulations, this specially designed enforcement vehicle will carry out the removal and clamping of illegally parked vehicles, leaving main routes unobstructed during these key times and allowing other road users to continue on their journeys without the unnecessary delay caused.\"\n\nEarlier this year the issue of clamping was in the headlines after footage emerged of Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly removing a clamp from his car, raising questions about the legality of clamping a vehicle in a private car park.\n\nSpeaking after the incident, legal expert Joshua Rozenberg said clamping legislation had not been updated in Northern Ireland since the 1970s and differed substantially from other parts of the UK.\n\nClamping on private land in England and Wales became an offence in 2012 under the Protection of Freedom Act, with the same law having been in place in Scotland since 2002.\n\nHowever, it remains legal in Northern Ireland.\n\nCompanies here can still hire contractors to clamp private cars on their land, although companies able to do this must be licensed by the Security Industry Authority  and are regulated by the British Parking Authority.\n\nThe maximum fee private contractors can charge to free a car from a clamp in Northern Ireland is £100.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"final recommendations for northern ireland electoral boundary changes published","story":"\n Hi

Under the proposals, published on Monday, Northern Ireland will have 17 constituencies down one from the current 18.\n\n\n\nPlans to split a town into three voting zones dropped\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland electoral boundary changes - what constituency are you in?\n\n\n\nInteractive map: Northern Ireland electoral boundary changes\n \n\n\nThe changes would see two constituencies relatively unchanged, namely Foyle and Fermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone. There would be four new constituencies - Sperrin, Causeway, Mid Antrim and Mid Down.\n\n\nFlashback to 2017 General Election results: \n\nEast Belfast\n .... \nNorth Belfast \n\n\n.... \nSouth Belfast\n \n\n.... \nWest Belfast \n\n\n.... \nEast Antrim \n\n\n.... \nEast Londonderry \n\n\n.... \nFermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone\n \n\n.... \nFoyle \n\n\n.... \nLagan Valley \n \n\n.... \n\n\nMid Ulster \n \n\n.... \nNewry \u0026 Armagh \n\n\n.... \nNorth Antrim \n \n\n.... \nNorth Down\n \n\n.... \nSouth Antrim\n \n\n.... \nSouth Down\n \n\n.... \nStrangford \n \n\n.... \nUpper Bann  \n\n\n....\nWest Tyrone  \n\n\n....\n\nEleven remain with the same name, although their boundaries are altered. They are the four sets in Belfast, East Antrim, Mid Ulster, Newry and Armagh, North Down, South Antrim, South Down and Upper Bann.\n\nAnd effectively disappearing - because there would be no obvious successor in the new plans - would be North Antrim, Lagan Valley, Strangford, East Londonderry and West Tyrone.\n\nA previous proposal to reduce Belfast to three constituencies has disappeared.\n\nThe iations in the number of people living in each constituency would be reduced - meaning they would be closer in size in terms of people represented.\n\nCurrently the smallest constituency is East Antrim with 59,658 electors on December 2015, while the largest is Upper Bann with 80,218.\n\nUnder the Boundary Commission plans the smallest would become Upper Bann with 69,795 people eligible to vote and the largest, Mid Down, with 77,767.\n\n\n\nThe Boundary Commission has been working on the changes since 2013 and the final recommendations come after a large scale consultation process. Almost 10,000 petition signatures and letters were received by the organisation.\n\nThe matter will be put to parliament and debated before new legislation is put in place to enact the changes, if a vote approves the changes.\n\nDeputy Chair of the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland, Madam Justice Denise McBride DBE, QC said: \"The Boundary Commission has determined its final recommendations after careful consideration of all the evidence collected during three stages of open and transparent public consultation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final recommendation proposes 17 constituencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Commission is grateful to all those who took the time and trouble to respond. We have sought, where possible, to try and accommodate the wide range of views and proposals presented whilst remaining within the constraint of the statutory criteria imposed upon the 2018 Review.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed urgent health decisions held up due to lack of northern ireland government","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There has been confusion as to what power civil servants have.\n\nEarlier this year a judge ruled the Department of Infrastructure had no power to approve a multi-million pound incinerator project as the decision should be taken by a minister. \n\nSecretary of State Karen Bradley has said she will bring forward legislation in Westminster to clarify the extent of powers those in the civil service have in a bid to allow government to continue to function without political leadership. \n\nMr Beggs found 13 strategies required ministerial imput. They include an evaluation of the Bamford review into mental health services, policy on GP services, agreement on minimum pricing of alcohol and a suicide prevention strategy. \n\nThere were six pieces of legislation awaiting Assembly approval. They included laws on supporting breastfeeding in public, e-cigarettes restrictions and a response to a ban on people smoking in cars with children. \n\nMr Beggs stressed those issues were just those that had been though the necessary planning and development. He said in the 600 days since the Executive\u0027s collapse the crisis in the health service had \"deepened to the extent patients are coming to harm, thousands of positions across the health service are vacant and the gap between demand and capacity of the local system has widened even further\". \n\nHe added: \"Even the 2018/19 pay award for our doctors and nurses remains up in the air, despite being already finalised in England, Scotland and Wales. We are now half way through the financial year without a local decision. \n\n“Another key decision outstanding are what actions are required to live within Budget for 2019/20. The last time the Health Department used language like that was in summer 2017 when each of Northern Ireland’s five health trusts announced sweeping cuts in a desperate attempt to make £70m of emergency savings.\n\n\"The later changes are left in the health service the higher the impact it has on frontline patient services.\n\n“Most of the issues in the list however are non-contentious and have cross-party support yet they can’t be advanced simply because there is no mechanism in place in the absence of an Executive.\n\n“The Secretary of State has allowed the stalemate to run on for far too long. Most, if not all, of these delays could have been avoided had she acted much quicker to put some form of decision making in place before now.\n\n“Without a Minister in place to take and implement health decisions, our waiting lists will continue to get even longer and the community will suffer. \n\n\"The Prime Minister has a responsibility to everyone in the UK.  A meeting of the Assembly should be called and if local politicians fail to appoint a functioning Executive, the Prime Minster needs to step in and appoint a direct rule Health Minister to end the drift in healthcare.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"serious gaps in governance throughout cervicalcheck programme","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Scally Review into the cervical smear controversy in the Republic found there were \"serious gaps\" in governance and expertise and failure across the whole system of the CervicalCheck programme.\n\nhttps:www.belfasttelegraph/news/republic-of-ireland/serious-gaps-in-governance-throughout-cervicalcheck-programme-37310237.html\n\nhttps:www.belfasttelegraph/incoming/article37310895.ece/25c71/AUTOCROP/h342/l_S-_Read-Only_%202.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Scally Review into the cervical smear controversy in the Republic found there were \"serious gaps\" in governance and expertise and failure across the whole system of the CervicalCheck programme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nThe scandal saw 221 women with cervical cancer not informed that smear test results showing them to be clear were inaccurate and that revised test results were kept from them.\n\nThe controversy emerged after Vicky Phelan  settled a court action against a US lab in April for ¤2.5m after her cancer was missed in a smear test taken by CervicalCheck programme. \n\nDr Gabriel Scally said there was a \"demonstrable deficit of clear governance\" and reporting lines within the National Screening Service and the higher management of the Republic\u0027s Health and Safety Executive.\n\nIn his 170-page report, Dr Scally said that there were problems in every area he examined but added that there was \"no evidence\" of a cover-up or conspiracy.\n\nDr Scally said that he believes there is not a need for a commission of investigation, adding that he has outlined what his priorities are.\n\nHe has made 50 recommendations, which the Irish government has accepted in full.\n\nSpeaking about his report, Dr Scally said that the issue of non-disclosure was felt \"very intensely\" by the women and their families who expressed anger at not being told about the test results when it became available.\n\n\"In my view the matter in which they were eventually told about their situation, in many cases ied from unsatisfactory and inappropriate to damaging hurt and offensive,\" he said.\n\nDr Scally also said that the relationship between the women involved and the clinicians were \"doomed to be bad\", criticising the manner in which they were told about their incorrect results.\n\nHe said that women involved described how they were \"shut down\" by clinicians over simple questions and were ushered out the door.\n\nWhen some of the women asked clinicians why they were not told, some consultants said they \"didn\u0027t know the protocol\" while others claimed it was lost in files, while another said it was \"caveated\" not to disclose.\n\nThe report described how some women were brought into disclosure meetings in the same room as they were diagnosed and, in the case of one woman, the same room her mother died in.\n\nIrish health minister Simon Harris said that he would bring a plan forward for implementing the Scally recommendations before the end of the year.\n\nHe added: \"The voice of the patient needs to be embedded in our health care system.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein proposes lowering voting age to","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

Fein has proposed lowering the voting age in Ireland to 16 in a bid to reform the electoral system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nThe party launched its document on electoral reform on Thursday, and said lowering the voting age is the pathway to participation for young and first-time voters.\n\nThe document also proposes extending voting rights to those who have been resident in the state for more than five years.\n\nParty spokesman for youth affairs, Senator Fintan Warfield, said the government should not gate-keep voting registers and should allow as many people as possible to vote, opening Seanad elections to all.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nFintan Warfield \n\n\n\n\n“This document really follows the Repeal the Eighth movement and identifies how Sinn Fein believe the state should engage young and first-time voters, and radical proposals to reform the electoral system,” he said.\n\n“We think that begins with a permanent electoral commission.\n\n“The government has previously responded to electoral issues with commitment to create a permanent electoral commission yet we have not seen any development on that front.\n\n“We believe an electoral commission should oversee registration processes, registration processes should be national, should promote registration and collect data on the basis of age.\n\n“We’re also looking at electoral reform and lowering the voting age to 16 and 17 in all elections and extend voting rights to people have been resident in the state for over five years.\n\n“It’s not good enough that we gate-keep the system, and Sinn Fein believe as many people as possible should be able to vote, that includes emigrants abroad, people in the north in presidential elections, people who have never voted in Seanad elections, who may not be citizens they’re entitled to vote.”\n\nA number of Government reports have recommended the establishment of a permanent electoral commission to aid the democratic process.\n\nThe Programme for Government committed to establishing such a commission during its term of office but initially said it would not be ready for the 2016 election.\n\nCritics say the government has provided no firm details or timeline for establishing a commission.\n\nThe Citizens’ Assembly approved a number of proposals in January including 94% in favour of a permanent Electoral Commission.\n\nIn May, Fianna Fail and the Green Party called on the government to establish a permanent electoral commission, saying it was urgently needed.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"control

heard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nResidents inside the burning block were instructed to remain in their flats until 2.47am on June 14 last year, nearly two hours after emergency services were first called.\n\nAlexandra Norman, a temporary operations manager at the London Fire Brigade , lost confidence in the strategy by 2am, the inquiry into the blaze was told on Thursday.\n\nBut a lack of communication from crews battling the inferno meant it was unclear whether it would be safe to tell residents to escape, she claimed.\n\nStay-put advice is only considered desirable if a flat is not directly affected by smoke or fire.\n\nMs Norman had spoken to callers who reported both.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nThe fire quickly engulfed the 24-storey tower in June last year \n\n\n\n\nThe LFB has faced fierce criticism for not ordering an evacuation of the 24-storey block until 2.47am.\n\nMs Norman told a hearing at Holborn Bars: “I had absolutely no confirmation of the conditions inside that building, we could be sending them into more toxic and worse conditions than their flats were at that point.\n\n“Not knowing what you would be sending them out to felt more of a risk to me.”\n\nThe operations manager was the most senior figure in the control room in Stratford, east London, when the fire broke out at 12.54am.\n\nShe spoke directly with several eventual victims of the disaster, including 56-year-old Denis Murphy.\n\nA transcript of her call with the trapped father showed her reluctance to accept flames had already reached his 14th floor flat from the original flat on the fourth floor.\n\nTheir exchange underscored an apparent lack of awareness among LFB control room staff about how rapidly and catastrophically the block was being incinerated.\n\nRadio silence from those tackling the fire directly had been further compounded by the absence of live footage from helicopter cameras in the temporary Stratford control room, the inquiry heard.\n\nBy 2am, Ms Norman was questioning the wisdom of stay-put advice, as she knew flats were usually designed to withstand fires for an hour.\n\n\n\nComing up to that hour mark we were still getting lots of calls from people that were trapped and I was becoming very, very uncomfortable with it – much more so than earlier on\nAlexandra Norman, fire control room supervisor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nShe told the inquiry: “Coming up to that hour mark we were still getting lots of calls from people that were trapped and I was becoming very, very uncomfortable with it – much more so than earlier on.\n\n“That is the time that compartments are safe, you are safe to stay in your flat for up to an hour and we were approaching that hour.”\n\nAsked by Richard Millett QC, the inquiry’s top lawyer, whether she took any action at that point, she said: “Not at that point, no – we didn’t know what the situation was in the building.”\n\nPressed on when she first felt the fire was “out of control”, Ms Norman said: “Probably around that time, about 2am-ish, it had been going on for a long time, over an hour, but we still had nothing back from the fireground and we had no details about what was going on.”\n\nThe control room received more calls requiring fire survival guidance  that night than in all of the previous decade across the capital.\n\nDue to the overwhelming demand, senior managers had no time to contact command unit vehicles at the west London block to ask for an update, Ms Norman said.\n\nAccess to the helicopter footage would have meant there was “a lot more awareness” about what was happening, but the team “would have still felt that it was safer to keep people in their flats because we couldn’t see the interior”, she added.\n\nIt also emerged during Thursday’s hearing that residents who had been told to stay put by 999 operators were not called back when the advice was ditched.\n\nLFB has a policy not to contact previous callers, meaning those instructed to await rescue inside would not realise evacuation was now recommended unless they happened to ring 999 again.\n\nMs Norman said it would have been “impossible” and “time-consuming” to get in touch with everyone who had been told to stay put.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"if you could be rid of one annoying

The media captured the events of the day relaying it to a mass audience via TV and radio, and subsequently it became known as the day the Troubles began.\n\nThe event is being held as part of the Speeches Strikes and Struggles series which has been running throughout the year, led by Derry City and Strabane District Council and supported by the Esmee Fairbairn Collections Fund. The programme aims to open archive materials up to new audiences and offer a iety of perspectives on what was an immensely significant era.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the event, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor John Boyle, said it would provide a unique opportunity to hear first-hand accounts from some of the people who led the civil rights campaign. \n\n“The Duke Street March changed the course of local history by initiating a movement against the civil oppression which had affected the lives of so many people across N. Ireland. People took to the streets to demonstrate that they were not prepared to accept the ongoing violation of their civil rights which had become the accepted way of life here.\n\n“50 years on we live in a very different society thanks to the actions of those who were prepared to stand up against oppression. This is a great chance to hear from some of the veteran leaders of that movement and their first-hand accounts of what actually happened on that day.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nOn the day young people will have the opportunity to put their questions to a special panel made up of Civil Rights veteran Eamonn McCann, Aidan McKinney and Anne Devlin.

These workshops have been designed to help childminders grow in confidence with the knowledge that they are providing the best nutrition for the children in their settings.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nWorkshops will be running on 25 September 2018 from 7pm to 9pm in Lecture Theatre 2, South West Acute Hospital, Enniskillen and 27 September 2018 from 7pm to 9pm in Trust Headquarters, MDEC Building, Altnagelvin Hospital site, Derry, covering nutrition guidelines and portion sizes for weaning and 1-5 year olds, sugar and dental health along with healthy snack and meal planning ideas that childminders can take away and use in their own settings.\n\nFor additional information about the workshops or to book a place please contact the Health Improvement, Equality and Involvement Department on 02871865127 or \n[email\u0026#160protected]\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"extra funding to save montgomeryshire butterfly habitats after success of wildlife trust scheme","story":"\nVolunteer Mike Saunderson with Rob Haigh  and Tammy Stretton  at the Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust site at Llanymynech Rocks on Friday, October 27, 2017.Pic: Mike Sheridan/County TimesMS762-2017\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8551747/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nExtra funding to save Montgomeryshire butterfly habitats after success of Wildlife Trust scheme\n\nThe Pearl Bordered Fritillary\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8551746/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nExtra funding to save Montgomeryshire butterfly habitats after success of Wildlife Trust scheme\n\nEncironmental officer Tammy Stretton at the Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust site \u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtat Llanymynech Rocks\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gt on Friday, October 27, 2017.Pic: Mike Sheridan/County TimesMS762-2017\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8551748/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nExtra funding to save Montgomeryshire butterfly habitats after success of Wildlife Trust scheme\n\nMike Saunderson, Rob Haigh and Tammy Stretton go\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gt over some survey data at the Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust site at Llanymynech Rocks on Friday, October 27, 2017.Pic: Mike Sheridan/County TimesMS762-\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8551749/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                \n                            \n\n                            \nSkip to next image \u0026raquo\n                        \n                    \n"},{"url":null,"title":"montgomery castle new security spikes installed on car park gate labelled as ridiculous","story":"\nAngry resident Bruce Lawson with the spikes at Montgomery Castle gates.

Bredagh cruised to a 3-9 to 1-7 win over Annaclone and Saul upset the odds with a sensational 1-15 to 1-6 win over a fancied Ballymartin outfit in Newcastle.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe JFC semi-finals draw was also made on Monday night and sees Ardglass take on Teconnaught, with Aughlisnafin facing the winners of tonight\u0026rsquos replay between Kilclief and Aghaderg in Castlewellan.\n\nArdglass displayed a great tactical awareness to get the better of Dromara on a 2-7 to 0-11 scoreline at Drumaness on Saturday and Teconnaught beat St Paul\u0026rsquos 3-16 to 0-11 after they produced a storming second half performance.\n\nAughlisnafin, as expected, edged out Newry Mitchels 1-13 to 2-7 at a wet and windy Mayobridge on Monday night and they will most certainly fancy their chances against either Kilclief or Aghaderg.

While the move has been welcomed by the SDLP, it has been criticised by the DUP.\n\nThe current Strangford Westminster constituency is to be broken up and renamed Mid Down, covering an area stretching from Banbridge to Newtownards which will have an electorate of almost 77,800.\n\nPortaferry and a large part of the Ards peninsula, also currently in Strangford, will move into North Down.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe new Mid Down constituency will also include part of the current Lagan Valley constituency which is to become defunct under the revised proposals.\n\nIn addition to the transfer of the Killyleagh area into South Down, plans to move the Crossgar area from the constituency into Strangford have been aborted, while it is proposed to move Loughbrickland into South Down from Lagan Valley.\n\nThe new plan illustrates how Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos political borders could look like in years to come and there has been a mixed political reaction to moving Killyleagh back into South Down and retaining Crossgar in the constituency.\n\nRowallane councillor Billy Walker believes people in Killyleagh will be \u0026ldquounhappy about plans to move the area into South Down which is currently represented by Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard who does not take his seat at Westminster.\n\n\u0026ldquoCurrent Strangford MP Jim Shannon is recognised as one of the hardest working MPs at Westminster and while there are plans to create a new Mid Down constituency, I have no doubt the overwhelming majority of people in the Killyleagh area want to be represented at the heart of government in London by an MP who takes his seat, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoBallynahinch, Saintfield, Killyleagh, Derryboye and Kilmore and part of Crossgar are currently in Strangford and I have no doubt voters in these areas will want to be part of the new Mid Down constituency. From my point of view, I would like to see all of Crossgar in it.\n\nCllr Walker said he hopes the proposed boundary changes will not be rubber stamped, suggesting there is not an appetite for change among people in Killyleagh to move back into South Down.\n\nBut former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie, believes the retention of Crossgar in South Down and the plan to reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency is welcome.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt would appear that the integrity of the historic constituency of South Down has remained intact with the addition of Loughbrickland on the western flank. However, it would appear that the Boundary Commission has been listening to submissions made at their inquiries and has retained Crossgar within the historic boundary, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoAn interesting feature has been the addition of the Killyleagh electoral ward which was removed from the constituency about 22 years ago. If this is the case, then this is a welcome move in that it would reinstate historic social, trading, cultural, economic and educational ties within the South Down constituency.\n\nThe former MP argued the plan to retain Crossgar in South Down and reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency ensures that the existing economic, educational, health, social, parish, and transport ties that exist and will continue.\n\nMiss Ritchie added: \u0026ldquoThe recommendations ensure that the local population has a defined identity within the new constituency of South Down providing that greater level of homogeneity.\n\n\u0026ldquoSuch proposals would ensure that communities in Crossgar and Killyleagh can identify with their neighbours in Lecale and Downpatrick with whom they have had strong trading, health and economic links for many decades.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Kilcoo cruise through to last four  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO flexed their considerable muscle to send Downpatrick spiralling out of the SFC quarter-finals at St Patrick\u0026rsquos Park, Newcastle, on Saturday night.\n\nApart from a promising opening 15 minutes from Downpatrick, it really was all Kilcoo and two goals in eight minutes at the start of the second half put this tie to bed.\n\nThe influential Paul Devlin gave Kilcoo a third minute lead before Conor McGrady cancelled that score with a point for Downpatrick.

It also provided an opportunity to maximise the natural resources of Portaferry by creating a space to access the outdoor recreational infrastructure with a particular focus on maritime activity.\n\nThe project began in 2017 when, after a seven-year search for ideas and funding, the sailing club was successful in getting permission to develop a semi-derelict building adjoining its premises.\n\nTo develop and manage the property, the club formed Portaferry Community Services Ltd.\u0026nbsp Renovation work on the Hub was finally completed in April this year.\u0026nbsp\n\nFunding came from a number of sources including Portaferry Regeneration Ltd through their Heritage Lottery\u0026rsquos Townscape Heritage Initiative, Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, the Rural Development Programme, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, Leader, Rural Partners Ards and North Down, Ards and North Down Borough Council, The Coastal Communities Fund and Portaferry Sailing Club.\n\nPrincess Anne was welcomed on Wednesday morning by Mr Leonard Lawson, Director of Portaferry Community Services Ltd, who managed the Hub project, and Mr John McAlea, commodore of Portaferry Sailing Club.\n\nThanking Princess Anne, Mr Leonard paid tribute to all of the people who brought the project to a successful fruition, including the architect, contractor, consultants, ious funders and user groups, as well as the sailing club and its voluntary workforce.\n\nHe said the club had the \u0026ldquovision and courage to invest in this project and risk going ahead with such a large scheme and had trusted him to manage the project.\n\n\u0026ldquoPeople don\u0026rsquot realise that when groups within communities create these schemes they are depending on vast amounts of voluntary input in terms of time and commitment, Mr Lawson remarked.\n\n\u0026ldquoI would like to thank each and everyone one of you for the support and co-operation that has made this project possible.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt is incredible that It takes all this number of people, the thousands of emails, countless meetings, official forms, letters and telephone calls to bring this about.

Their journey will taken over four months and will be fraught with danger from disease, crocodiles, swamps and fast-flowing rapids.\n\nNo-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus admits that their trip will not be easy. \u0026ldquoIt is a little frightening even thinking about it, but I am looking forward to it immensely, he said.\n\nMarcus is now living in Liverpool where he studied at the local university, and has been planning the expedition for the past two years.\n\nAfter travelling to the Ugandan border the eight will head north down the river through Sudan and Egypt. It is a journey which will take them through the Sudd \u0026mdash probably the world\u0026rsquos largest swamp \u0026mdash and through the foaming Nile cataracts.\n\nMarcus began canoeing at Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre outside Castlewellan, but only took up the sport seriously at university.\n\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never tackled anything as formidable as the Nile before, he said. \u0026ldquoPerhaps one of the hardest things has been trying to arrange sponsorship. We have each spent months writing letters to ious firms asking them for equipment. The cost of the trip will be around \u0026pound8,000.\n\nThe group are disappointed that they will not be able to travel over the complete length of the Nile because of the situation in Uganda, which has made it too dangerous to start at the head waters.\n\nHowever, they will still have the satisfaction of travelling over much of the ground covered by the Victorian explorers who struggled for decades to trace the Nile\u0026rsquos source.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash A \u0026pound28,000 scheme to deepen the harbour at Ardglass will begin within the next two weeks. Already a huge dredger has been brought to the site and a few explanatory digs have been made.\n\nThe work, when completed early in the new year, will allow fishing boats to land their catches alongside the market. At present it is impossible for the boats to unload their catches at the fish market during low tide.\n\nWith only some three feet of water modern day trawlers are just too big to lie in the harbour without bumping the bottom. The new scheme will aim at providing approximately ten feet of water at low tide, thus enabling the biggest of the boats to unload at the fish market.\n\nUntil then the boats will have to follow their usual and unsatisfactory custom of unloading at the main pier and having their catch transported by trucks to the market.\n\nNot since 1940 had dredging been carried out at Ardglass and the work will go a long way towards restoring Ardglass as a major fishing port.\n\nSTRANGFORD LOUGH \u0026mdash A secret experiment on Strangford Lough has helped scientists towards a major breakthrough in a three-year battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.\n\nResearch at Queen\u0026rsquos University in Belfast has now produced a revolutionary type of ocean buoy which could supply enough electricity for a town of 15,000 people. A chain or such buoys off our coast could one day be one of our main sources of power.\n\nDetails of the exciting new scheme were only released yesterday, though the Strangford Lough experiment took place almost a year ago. It was that small-scale which gave the scientists enough information to produce a design for a full-scale device.\n\nFour or five similar experiments are currently being considered by the Department of Energy in Britain for use in a wave energy programme and researchers at Queen\u0026rsquos are hoping their buoy will be one of those chosen.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash The beautiful peninsular town of Portaferry has been chosen for a major award in the Central Gardens Association Best Kept Villages and Towns competition for 1978.\n\nThe Association awarded Portaferry the title of \u0026lsquothe small town showing most improvement\u0026rsquo for its landscaping and environmental quality.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash News that a proposed sheltered housing scheme for Comber has been axed by the planners brought an angry reaction from local councillors this week.\n\nArds Borough councillors were told that a planning application from the Fold Housing Association for a housing scheme for the elderly in Castle Street had been refused on several grounds.\n\nComber councillor John Shields said: \u0026ldquoIt is this ridiculous that this application has been turned down. I think every effort should be made to accommodate the old people in the area.\n\nA planning official, Mr Des Stevens, said that the main objections had been that the department was not prepared to locate old people in an area where there was industrial development and also that there would be a problem of providing access for a housing scheme.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Tote betting returns to Downpatrick racecourse for the first time in eight years at the end of the month. Mr Barry Ross, course registrar, confirmed that following consolation it has been decided to operate a tote.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis will be a trial basis and will first come into operation at the meeting of September 30, he explained. \u0026ldquoThis will coincide with the visit of Red Rum who will be parading and we are hoping for a big public turnout.\n\nMr Ross and Major William Browlow, Downpatrick race club chairman, were in Dublin recently for a top level meeting with Irish Racing Board officials.\n\nBALLYNAHINCH \u0026mdash Plessey, the electronics and telecommunications firm with a factory in Ballynahinch, has announced that pretax profits for the first quarter of this year have held at the same level of \u0026pound12.4 million achieved last year.\n\nSTRANGFORD \u0026mdash Delays in the contract for the new council playing fields in Strangford have been sorted out. The breakthrough came last week following a meeting between Down Council\u0026rsquos chairman and clerk, and the council\u0026rsquos solicitors.\n\nIt is believed that the purpose of the meeting was to speed up some of the legal work on council projects and at a meeting this week it was reported the problem in the playing fields contract had been solved.\n\nKILLYLEAGH \u0026mdash Back on September 7, 1938, Isaac and Annie Minnis walked up the aisle of Killyleagh Parish Church.

Both rings are decorated.\n\nThe broken ring\u0026rsquos surface is divided into a number of panels, some with a cross-style motif. The decoration, though not as accomplished as on other examples, does compare with similar patterns which experts suggest characterise a series of silver rings of 12th-century date from both Ireland and Britain.\n\nThe intact rings decoration includes a flower pattern and traces of lettering which may read a version of \u0026lsquoIESU REX EXAUDI NOS\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash \u0026lsquoJesus, king, hear us\u0026rsquo, but this is not certain.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe nature of the lettering, which is termed Lombardic, suggests the 13th or 14th century while the style of the ring overall is consistent with this date.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, diversity in the church, compassion for the complexities of life and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own life journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by individual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.
