Dr Bux, in considering the diagnosis, undertook a telephone consultation with the ill holidaymaker and diagnosed infective gastroenteritis as a result of food poisoning which he concluded was due to inadequate food preparation and food handling at the hotel.Karen Smith, Operations Manager for Beachcomber Tours, handled this claim and had concerns that Dr Bux\u0027s diagnosis differed from that of the doctor at the resort. She also discovered that Dr Bux\u0027s wife was a Partner at AMS Solicitors.              Dr Bux was found to be at fault for failing to disclose his solicitor wife Sehana (right) was a director for AMS, the solicitors firm which had commissioned him to act as a medical witness in county court claims (left: Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester)Further cases involved one claim in Fuerteventura where a patient suffered a rash in November 2015 and was treated in hospital on the island. In his report dated 26 July 2016, Dr Bux diagnosed the patient with an anaphylactic reaction secondary to infective gastroenteritis caused by food poisoning.A couple went on holiday to Benidorm in June 2015, and both complained of falling ill with food poisoning and both made a claim against TUI. Dr Bux produced reports dated 24 August 2016 and 25 August 2016 diagnosing both with infective gastroenteritis as a result of food poisoning which was caused by inadequate food preparation and handling, although he only spoke to them on the telephone.Allegations were found proven in each of the holiday cases, with Dr Bux failing to declare his personal relationship with his wife at AMS and diagnosing food poisoning without sufficient evidence.Tribunal chairman Julia Oakford said as Dr Bux\u0027s wife was a salaried partner at AMS, managing the litigation department, it was difficult to conclude she would have no knowledge or sight of the claims.The panel also ruled the doctor\u0027s actions were misleading, dishonest and financially motivated.She added: \u0027The tribunal found that Dr Bux diagnosed food poisoning alone as it was in his interest to write a positive report to enable him to sustain this stream of work.\u0027Expert witness Nigel Zoltie also criticised Dr Bux for circumcising the 15-month-old, referred to as Patient A, in a community setting.He said: \u0027It remains my opinion that all actions were likely to put Patient A at high risk of life-threatening complications that could only managed with great difficulty in the community. \u0027For a religious procedure these risks were unacceptable, and therefore the care was seriously below standard.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Grand Designs star Kevin McClouds housing development firm goes bust liquidators called in","story":"Share this article          In a personal letter to investors (excerpt pictured above) Mr McCloud said a bond would produce \u0027healthy returns that are economic, social and environmental\u0027A KPMG spokesperson said: \u0027In March 2019, following a period of difficult trading, the directors of HAB Land undertook a comprehensive review which led to the conclusion that they may not be in a position to repay the full amounts advanced from HAB Land Finance. \u0027Subsequently, the directors wrote to the bondholders of HAB Land Finance setting out the position and putting forward proposals in order to repay them.

The Milk Marketing Board had sent me up to Newcastle for a campaign, and the Stones happened to be staying at the same hotel. We’d just been to their concert, and were having a late dinner. They were sitting next to us. Various women were coming up to Mick Jagger and asking for his autograph. So my girlfriend, Julie – who became my wife of 55 years – went over, but she didn’t even get a chance to ask, because Mick just waved her away saying: “No, love, you’re too young.” I had my camera ready, but unfortunately I didn’t take a picture. That would have been fantastic, Mick waving his arms around.The next morning, the band were lounging around in the hotel foyer. To their evident annoyance I got my camera out and was about to snap them, but then their car arrived and they left before they had a chance to say to me: “Who do you think you are?” When I got chosen to do their album cover I was dreading the thought that Mick was going to recognise me, so I had my hair cut much shorter and changed my clothing.I was known for doing group scenes – a shoot with up to 50 people became known as a “Michael Joseph” in the business – and my early shot of a boardroom for a White Horse whisky ad in 1965 had been used as a giant poster all over England. That was what got me the Beggars Banquet job. The shoot location was wonderful, up in Sarum Chase, in Hampstead, north London, where Frank O Salisbury, the Victorian society painter, had lived and worked. The caretaker there – a very careful, grey-haired man – said: “So this is for the Rolling Stones?” I said: “Yes, I’m afraid they’re a bit wild.” He said: “No, that’s not a problem. But I’m a bit worried. Will there be any naked ladies?” And I said: “No, it’ll just be the band. Why, what’s the problem with naked ladies?” And he told me: “Well, for naked ladies, we charge £10 extra.”The 1961 film Viridiana, directed by Luis Buñuel – which has a famous scene of beggars at a banquet – was probably in the mind of Mike Peters, the art director. There’s meant to be a look of decadence about the photo. That word sums up the era. The swinging 60s was considered a period where people did what they liked.The Stones arrived punctually. They were impressed with my lighting setup, and this fantastic, beautiful room. I was already there, talking through a megaphone to the goats, dogs and all the other animals we had for the shoot, getting them to understand what it was all about. I was good with animals and they behaved very nicely. Most of the feast on the table was prop food, but luckily, I’d put down a bowl of real cherries, and the goat was munching away on those. There were some cats knocking around the set, too, and they didn’t seem to be put off by 20,000 joules of light flashing away.We only had two hours for the whole session, so literally within 10 minutes, the band were all changed. They just put on whatever costume they fancied and we didn’t bother with makeup – it wasn’t necessary. I put Keith Richards in the centre of the photo because he was the best-looking and the youngest. Bill Wyman, not so good-looking, so we put him further back. On the right, Brian Jones was very happy playing with a labrador. Charlie Watts was chatting up the stuffed monkey that’s on the table. Mick was happy to be centre-stage, standing on the table, cuddling some of the animals. There were other shots from this session where he’s holding a baby eagle, but then he got bored with that.Brian had been busted the night before. The police knew the band were smoking drugs, so they’d raided his place, but didn’t find anything. So he wasn’t actually arrested, but he was a bit subdued for the whole shoot. I obviously didn’t bring it up. Presumably, they’d been out drinking all the night before, but none of them even brought a cup of coffee in to the shoot.The band were very well-behaved and it all went like clockwork. My girlfriend was also at the shoot and at the end of the session, Mick came up to me and said: “You and your bird can come in my limo up to Swarkestone” – where we were doing more pictures for the album.

Even the most apparently innocuous dialogue may be coded and ambiguous, serving two opposed purposes simultaneously: one meaning for the secret grey listeners, who in le Carré’s world are always assumed to be paying attention, and another meaning altogether for the participants. It is dramatic chamber music, in which mere conversation provides all the suspense and slow-dawning revelation you could want at any scale.His new novel contains several delicious set pieces of this kind, and each time one gets going there is the sense of a master enjoying himself hugely: the characters themselves seem to become cleverer and wittier as their puppeteer’s dialogic invention takes flight. It can sometimes seem, indeed, as though the rest of the book comprises merely the stuff that has to be efficiently moved into place, just so, in order that these charged conversations become possible.The publicity for Agent Running in the Field has emphasised the fact that this is le Carré’s Brexit novel, and so it is, laced with fury at the senseless vandalism of Brexit and of Trump, and the way the one is driving Britain into the clammy embrace of the other. Cunningly, though, le Carré wrong-foots the reader to a degree by making the character who is a mouthpiece for this criticism a rather annoying, monomaniacal, friendless geek. This is the twentysomething Ed, who befriends our narrator at his badminton club and then, after their weekly games, discourses furiously on the state of the world.Our narrator, of course, is a spy: Nat, 47, a member of what le Carré used to call “the Circus” but in this book has become “the Office”. Recently returned from running agents under diplomatic cover in Estonia, he is now put out to pasture in an obscure subsection of the service that keeps an eye on Russian affairs but is separate from the powerful Russian desk itself. Nat’s new berth, the Haven, is a decrepit building in a Camden back street, “the Office’s home for lost dogs”. That phrase, and the building’s air of shabby irrelevance, are pleasurably reminiscent of the “slow horses” consigned to Slough House in the excellent modern spy novels about a group of MI5 failures and troublemakers by Mick Herron. Perhaps le Carré is keeping a fond eye on his younger apprentices.Nat is indulgent of his new friend Ed, partly because he enjoys their badminton games and partly because he feels a fatherly fondness towards him. “I knew the breed,” Nat reflects. “I’d recruited a few. He was geopolitically alert. He was young, highly intelligent within the margins of his fixed opinions.” But Ed’s fury at Brexit is dwarfed by what Nat finds leaking from the higher echelons of the Office: a desperate plan, code-named Jericho, for Britain to retain the good graces of a rogue American administration by doing some very bad things to its former European friends.Lest this all sound too much like a hardcore remainer conspiracy theory, be assured that the novel also contains, like any good James Bond film, a Russian femme fatale. (A veteran spymaster named Valentina, she does all the work with her seductive voice.) Nat, meanwhile, takes a tremendously atmospheric trip to the Czech Republic to meet an old agent of his: Arkady, whom Nat had temporarily turned as a double agent against Putin’s FSB. Their brief reunion is another spectacular set piece and Arkady is one of le Carré’s wonderful cameos: now a self-made kleptocrat living in maximum-security retirement, he sweats and weeps affection, but also hatred, for his former spymaster. Winningly, on Nat’s return home le Carré punctures the rich, nostalgic melodrama of this encounter with a touch of bureaucratic bathos: “London … has reimbursed my travel expenses, but questioned my use of a taxi to the lakeside hotel in Karlovy Vary. It seems there was a bus I could have taken.”At 288 pages, Agent Running in the Field is a miniature compared with le Carré’s great cold war novels, and it lacks the ruthless clockwork precision of, say, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. But it is a very classy entertainment about political ideals and deception. There is a terrific scene set in a park, in particular, in which we gradually realise that all the bystanders are part of a huge team of “watchers” marshalled by the spies to observe a secret conversation.

Following the premise that “great art comes from true freedom”, the agency seized on painting, music and literature as effective tools for promoting the western world’s values, and funded abstract expressionism exhibitions and jazz tours. But when it came to the country that produced Tolstoy, Pushkin and Gogol – a nation that, according to a character in Lara Prescott’s impressive debut novel, “values literature like the Americans value freedom” – the focus was always going to be on the written word. And her subject, the part the CIA played in bringing Boris Pasternak’s masterpiece Doctor Zhivago to worldwide recognition, was the jewel in cultural diplomacy’s crown.In 1955 rumours began to circulate that Pasternak, hitherto known largely as a poet, having survived a heart attack and Stalin’s purges, was ailing and politically compromised but had nonetheless managed to finish his magnum opus. The sweeping, complex historical epic – and simple love story – that is Doctor Zhivago had been a decade in the writing under the most adverse circumstances imaginable: the imprisonment of Pasternak’s lover, Olga Vsevolodovna Ivinskaya the death in the gulag of his friend and fellow writer Osip Mandelstam and the suicides of two others in his circle, Paolo Iashvili and Marina Tsvetaeva constant surveillance and his own ill health. Because of its subversive emphasis on the inidual and its critical stance on the October Revolution, no publishing house in the Eastern bloc would touch it. When an enterprising Italian publisher sent a secret emissary to Pasternak’s dacha, in miserable desperation the writer handed it over, with the inscription “This is Doctor Zhivago. May it make its way around the world.” The manuscript was smuggled out to West Berlin – and the CIA made their move. Their aim was clandestinely to publish a Russian edition and return it to its homeland.This is remarkable raw material for a novel. Prescott’s book, the subject of a legal row after Pasternak’s great-niece Anna Pasternak accused her of plagiarising her own biography of Olga, has all the ingredients for a spy thriller. It has a great cast of characters and a wealth of historical detail to be mined, plus the potential for insight into a bizarre and compelling point in our history and, of course, a love story. Prescott’s first achievement is her identification of these qualities: weaving them into a complex and involving narrative is altogether more of a challenge, but she works hard and with considerable ambition to meet it, and entwines a surprising love story of her own invention.Like Doctor Zhivago, her novel follows a number of characters’ viewpoints. There is Pasternak himself and Olga, whom we first encounter as she is arrested, pregnant with his child, and imprisoned for refusing to ulge what she knows of the book. Irina Prozdhova, the Washington-based émigré daughter of a man murdered by the Russian regime, has been newly recruited by the agency Sally Forrester is an experienced spy and honeytrap or “swallow”. Both these women have secrets of their own. And, most engagingly, we hear from the communal voice of the typing pool of the CIA’s Soviet Russia ision.There are a couple of male walk-on parts, including, in the novel’s only properly bum note, CIA agent Teddy Helms, who courts Irina and whose brief section on a mission to Britain is so full of missteps (his MI6 contact referring to “the little Mrs”, English fish and chips being breaded rather than battered) that one begins to wonder if the author intends it as a riff on his obtuseness. And indeed there is a sly joke against the patriarchy woven into the plot: at a time when women were at their most invisible, expected to confine themselves to traditional roles, they made the best spies. It is the female characters who carry this adventure, from the pragmatic, loyal, indestructible Olga to the marvellous typists. With their Virginia Slims and Thermoses of turkey noodle soup, they make up a kind of smart, gossipy Greek chorus whose commentary begins and ends the novel.Prescott may not be an accomplished prose stylist, but her characterisation is often deft. Her Pasternak is vividly flawed: histrionic, lachrymose but stubbornly lovable. Her research is thorough if occasionally a little too visible, and the portrayal of the love between Olga and Pasternak is poignant and convincing.

Bernard is nominated alongside former winner Sharon Olds, who was picked for Arias, a collection that considers a woman’s intimate life and political conscience, tackling subjects from the cervix to Trayvon Martin.The chairman of the judges, John Burnside, paid tribute to all the writers on the shortlist, calling them “some of the finest and most fearless poets working today”.In a list tinged with violence, Anthony Anaxagorou was chosen for After the Formalities, which moves from the racial abuse of an Uber driver on the day of the Brexit referendum to a knife being pulled. Fiona Benson is selected for Vertigo \u0026amp Ghost, a series of poems about Zeus as a serial rapist, and Ilya Kaminsky for Deaf Republic. Set in an occupied country, Kaminsky’s poems tell of how when soldiers breaking up a protest kill a deaf boy, the citizens of the town all go deaf.“In an excellent year for poetry, the judges read over 150 collections from every corner of these islands, and beyond,” said Burnside. “Each had its own vital energy, its own argument to make, its own celebration or requiem to offer, and we knew that settling upon 10 from so many fine books would be difficult. Nevertheless, as our deliberations progressed, the same titles kept coming to the fore.”Vidyan Ravinthiran, who was born in Leeds to Sri Lankan Tamils, is shortlisted for his second collection, The Million-Petalled Flower of Being Here. It is a book of sonnets for his wife, many of which describe life in the north-east for a mixed-race couple.With numerous poetry awards already under his belt, Paul Farley makes this year’s list for his new collection The Mizzy. The lineup is completed by Deryn Rees-Jones’s Erato, which draws its title from the muse of lyric poetry, Roger Robinson’s A Portable Paradise, and Karen Solie’s The Caiplie Caves. The Canadian poet’s fifth collection, the latter tells of the seventh-century Irish missionary to Scotland, St Ethernan, and how he retreated to the caves of the Fife coast.At £25,000, the TS Eliot is the UK’s most valuable poetry award.

The overall availability of credit to the corporate sector was reported to have remained unchanged in Q3, and this was the case for small, medium and large businesses (Chart 2). The overall availability of credit to the corporate sector was expected to decrease in Q4.Why? It appears that the banks are reacting to caution among their own customers.The BoE’s survey found that lenders expect demand for corporate lending to fall in the current quarter too, with medium-sized businesses particularly reluctant to borrow more.That implies that companies are resisting new investment, or expansions, while they await clarity on Brexit.Bloomberg has written about the support available to UK businesses facing Brexit worries:Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc is running Brexit clinics in the hope of soothing concerns that small and mid-sized businesses aren’t ready for what awaits them.RBS’s NatWest bank is holding meetings across the country, coaching businesses on how to face disruption to trade, workers or data flows once the U.K. leaves the European Union, it said in a press release on Thursday. The bank is also making £8.2bn ($10.5 billion) in loans available to support small businesses during Brexit, up from the £6bn pounds it previously announced.Building supplies group Grafton has issued a profits warning, blaming weaker demand in the UK (among other issues).The company, which sells bricks, timber, cement, roof tiles, paint and bathroom fittings, told shareholders it has suffered “a softening in activity” in recent weeks.Volumes in the UK merchanting business were affected by weak underlying demand fundamentals as households deferred discretionary spending on home improvement projects against the backdrop of increased economic uncertainty. That implies that UK customers have been holding off moving house, or improving their homes, until they have clarity over Brexit.WH Smith, the high street and travel hub retailer, has been stockpiling products in case of Brexit disruption.It told the City this morning:The Group is prepared for Brexit and has put in place contingency plans to manage the impact, including increasing the stock of convenience products.It’s also landed a £300m deal to buy US travel retailer Marshall Retail, which runs outlets at American casino resorts and airport.Brexit uncertainty has sent the pound lurching around this morning.Sterling tumbled back from last night’s five-month high, after the DUP party rejected the deal being drawn up between Boris Johnson and the European Union.DUP support is crucial to Johnson’s hopes of persuading parliament to back his revised deal.But, they’re unhappy about the proposed customs checks at the Irish Sea, the way VAT would be handled across the border after Brexit, and Northern Ireland’s ability to consent to the arrangements.This wiped a cent of the pound in early London trading, but it’s creeping back towards $1.28 -- and still up around six cents in a week.The UK government has welcomed NatWest’s £2.2bn boost for firms struggling with Brexit.“Financial support from banks is often crucial to the success of an SME. So it is great to see NatWest reaffirming support for their business customers through our new SME Finance Charter. “NatWest’s commitments of continued and proactive support will give their SME customers the confidence they need ahead of Brexit on 31 October and beyond - with opportunities to thrive, grow and scale up in new markets.”Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.With the Brexit deadline less than 15 days away, British businesses are adopting the brace position.Some are stockpiling vital goods in case of long queues at the ports, while others are frantically brushing up on exports rules so they can keep shipping goods and offering services across the channel. But however much preparation they put in, disruption may be inevitable — especially in a disorderly no-deal Brexit.This morning, NatWest Bank has warned that thousands of its customers are particularly vulnerable to the fog of Brexit uncertainty enveloping the UK.The bank, part of Royal Bank of Scotland, is boosting its support fund by another £2.2bn to protect UK firms from Brexit damage. That raises the pot of funding to £8.2bn.“Through its on-going Brexit Customer Outreach Programme, NatWest has identified several thousand customers who may be the most impacted by the Brexit uncertainties, and has committed to proactively contacting those customers to help with their needs.”The bank is also pledging to “support customers through Brexit” — which hopefully means some understanding and leniency if a firm’s cashflow suddenly clogs up, or sales take a e.NatWest is also holding events around the country for nervous business leaders to discuss their concerns about Brexit (and other issues too, of course).That £8.2bn is billed as a “Growth Funding” package -- speak to business leaders, and many will point out that Brexit is the biggest factor holding back growth and investment.Paul Thwaite, NatWest’s managing director for Commercial Banking, says there’s “a lot to do” to get ready for Brexit: “During a time of such uncertainty, it is imperative that we do all we can to support our customers. Our business customers are extremely busy, and there is a lot to do. This is why we wanted to go to them offering our support in a proactive way.We are very much open for business and want to be the bank that supports the UK’s businesses through this uncertain time.”The pound remains highly volatile, as traders try to assess the chances of a deal. It hit a five-month high of $1.2875 last night, but has fallen by over a cent since, as the government struggles to persuade the DUP party to support it.With EU leaders gathering for a crucial summit in Brussels today, sterling will surely be highly volatile today..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/626b6eae38d5a69efad832ebaca159c9c79db536/0_904_4342_2606/master/4342.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eca549027cbe59751a82d40576b2bf5","title":"a way of learning from everything the rise of the city critic","story":"Criticism of food and the arts has long flourished. In our increasingly urban world, perhaps city criticism should be recognised as distinct and necessary“On any person who desires such queer prizes, New York will bestow the gift of loneliness and the gift of privacy,” wrote EB White in his 1949 essay, Here Is New York.White sizes up both the positive and negative potential of the teeming Manhattan with the familiarity of a native and the heightened awareness of a visitor. A longtime contributor to the New Yorker magazine, White also wrote the classic children’s book Charlotte’s Web and co-wrote the influential writing guide The Elements of Style. In Here Is New York, he takes that versatility further, giving us a new way of seeing the city in an early example of what we might today call city criticism.Given how long we’ve relied on the work of critics on film, music, food, and much else besides, as well as the ever-increasing relevance of cities in our lives, it’s time we recognised city criticism as its own distinct category of writing. But what is city criticism — or rather, what isn’t it?Despite dealing with the built environment, it isn’t architecture criticism, not in the sense of treating structures like sculptures, indulging in a “collective obsession with idiosyncratic starchitect buildings,” writes Globe and Mail architecture critic Alex Bozikovic. Architecture matters in city criticism only to the extent that it explores “what’s designed and built in the context of a broader narrative,” writes Curbed urbanism editor Alissa Walker. “What’s happening in the surrounding community, what political efforts hindered progress, and, conceding all those externalities, can the project still best serve the audience that it is intended to serve?”Yet city criticism isn’t reportage. Like movie or restaurant reviewers, city critics write from their own perspectives, in distinctive voices enriched by knowledge and experience, but wearing their erudition lightly. City critics understand that places reveal themselves through details encountered by chance, glimpsed and overheard.Iain Sinclair’s lifetime of walking London has produced a series of books notable for their intensity, as well as their density, of historical, cultural, and political observations. Whether the length of the entire M25 or of Sinclair’s neighbourhood of Hackney, his walks lead to disquisitions on not just redevelopment, gentrification and bus routes, but terrorism and asylums and alchemy and Hitchcock – as well as furious denunciations of London’s latter-day disfigurement by money and mega-projects.The term psychogeography, long associated with Sinclair’s work, has gone unexpectedly mainstream: many now apply it to their own artistic and peripatetic endeavours as they once called themselves flâneurs, those who walk city streets to observe urban society. In Lights Out for the Territory Sinclair describes the flâneur as “a stubborn creature, less interested in texture and fabric, eavesdropping on philosophical conversation pieces than noticing everything.” That mandate, taken on by German philosopher and essayist Walter Benjamin decades earlier, resulted in The Arcades Project: a densely referential, nearly thousand-page examination of the shopping arcades of late 19th- and early 20th-century Paris, perhaps the first and most ambitious work of city criticism.The Arcades Project was left unfinished at the time of Benjamin’s death in 1940. Here Is New York came at the end of that decade, and 1961 saw the publication of two volumes that still have much to teach us about the possibilities of city criticism: urban historian Lewis Mumford’s The City in History, which puts cities in context, and journalist Jane Jacobs’ The Death and Life of Great American Cities, which makes them a subject of activism.The most intellectually daring and flamboyant venture into city criticism yet came ten years thereafter, when architectural historian Reyner Banham wrote Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies, a contrarian yet enduring analysis of and argument for a place most critics and other city-minded intellectuals had long written off as a dysfunctional and tasteless, a grotesquely overgrown postwar suburb.“Los Angeles threatens the intellectual repose and professional livelihood of many architects, artists, planners, and environmentalists because it breaks the rules of urban design that they promulgate in works and writings and teach to their students,” writes Banham:In so far as Los Angeles performs the functions of a great city, in terms of size, cosmopolitan style, creative energy, international influence, distinctive way of life and corporate personality, to the extent that Los Angeles has these qualities, then to that same extent all the most admired theorists of the present century, from the Futurists and Le Corbusier to Jane Jacobs and Sibyl Moholy-Nagy, have been wrong.”Welsh travel writer Jan Morris went beyond the single city in an attempt to describe “the entire urban world”. The project led her to the lively but haunting rebuilt Hiroshima – missing an essential element “like salt with your victuals, or eyes in a beautiful face” – and to London, where “through the dingy and the disagreeable, the fantastic habitually looms.” Hong Kong she found “indefensible, militarily and economically, and it lives half on trust and half on cynicism,” while of her beloved Venice, which since the turn of the 19th century “has chiefly existed to be stared at”, she declared: “Let her sink.”City criticism is not travel writing, but it should take Morris’ work as a model of how to let readers see a city through the writer’s eyes. It should also pry loose the clichés that inevitably adhere to a place, as when Morris came to Los Angeles, eschewed references to stardom and sprawl, and described the city as where “the lost American faith in machines and materialism built its own astonishing monument.”Sometimes city criticism has tangible effects. Nearly 60 years after its publication, The Death and Life of Great American Cities continues to open readers’ eyes to the unplanned “ballet of the good city sidewalk” that Jacobs observed in her native New York City: in the students, shop owners, commuters and delivery people, “the inidual dancers and ensembles all have distinctive parts which miraculously reinforce each other and compose an orderly whole”.But Jacobs also raised the alarm about the threatened eradication of that finely grained street life by New York’s so-called master builder of freeways and high-rises, the urban planner Robert Moses. Later in the decade, she got involved in the struggle against Moses, repeatedly protesting against his plan to run the Lower Manhattan Expressway through her neighbourhood of Greenwich Village. After fighting the project to its death she moved to Toronto, a city that provided more subjects for her criticism and more development projects – a new freeway, a waterfront bridge – to publicly oppose.Some city critics will follow Jacobs’ example and seek to influence the shape of cities, while others will seek only to understand it. The architects Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Steven Izenour exemplify that method in 1972’s Learning from Las Vegas, a subject they felt obliged to justify: “We look backward at history and tradition to go forward we can also look downward to go upward,” they write. “Withholding judgment may be used as a tool to make later judgment more sensitive. This is a way of learning from everything.”Indeed, city critics should write about everything: their subject is a nexus of subjects. Ada Louise Huxtable concerned herself with not just her official beat of architecture at the New York Times and later the Wall Street Journal, but also development economics and the policy of land use and transportation the ultra-opinionated Ian Nairn savaged postwar Britain’s uninspired buildings and even less inspired city planning the New Yorker’s architecture critic Mumford wrote about highways, housing and planning, but also literature, technology and politics. And longtime writer on the built environment Karrie Jacobs points out that most writers on cities currently “either focus on urban problems or urban pleasures,” whereas “in truth, the problems and the pleasures have a symbiotic relationship,” which any critic worthy of the title understands.What would a more fully developed city criticism have to offer? Most who write about cities agree on one thing: helping effect change. The British writer Owen Hatherly, a sometime  Cities contributor who has looked often at post-Soviet urban landscapes, argues for city criticism to “help us understand cities, and how they have been shaped by very particular decisions, choices and interests, and that they can be changed, influenced and transformed in turn.” Nikil Saval, the Indian-American writer, puts capitalism in his crosshairs, since “you can often see examples of our economic system’s mutations and depredations in how cities and city politics work”. Spacing magazine’s Shawn Micallef sees his mission “to get people to really see, experience and live their city,” since they “won’t fight for something to be better if they haven’t yet fallen in love with it.” Walker underscores the importance of advocating for “the people who keep the city running.”But city critics should be be writers above all else. And though the past decade has seen an abundance of city-related content in print and online, cities need writers more than ever. That is, cities need to be written about well and in a way that lasts, not merely to spot trends, air grievances, or enter technocratic squabbles. Readers will only tolerate so much more one-dimensional discussion before developing city fatigue, and history has shown what happens to cities when the public loses interest in them. Hence the city critic’s mandate to keep readers engaged and thinking in the long term by treating the city as not just as a fashionable place to live and work, nor as an ideological, economic, and social battleground, but as one of the very richest, most stimulating subjects available.Unlike service journalism, city criticism must remain fresh while the city changes over time unlike academic theory, it must be written for the general public unlike activism, it must keep the distance necessary for keen, aesthetically sensitive observation. City critics must be invested in not just buildings, infrastructure, and public space, but in words, sentences, and the play of ideas. Only then can they write like EB White did on New York’s paradoxical generosity of privacy:It is this largesse that accounts for the presence within the city’s walls of a considerable section of the population for the residents of Manhattan are to a large extent strangers who have pulled up stakes somewhere and come to town, seeking sanctuary or fulfilment or some greater or lesser grail. The capacity to make such dubious gifs is a mysterious quality of New York. It can destroy an inidual, or it can fulfil him, depending a good deal on luck.”Despite having been written 70 years ago, the observation holds up today – though city critics to come, taking a page from each of these writers and others besides, should feel free to argue otherwise.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f1bf02d558f95d3f09797fffc01ef1b95b011d8/0_0_4926_2955/master/4926.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cb2caa662d77918e387f9fefe221fdc","title":"at first accepted brexit now clear must not leave eu","story":"Though we don’t always admit it, lots of us pro-Europeans have spent the years since the Brexit referendum trying to juggle two essentially irreconcilable views of what should happen next. One is that, awful though Brexit is, the leave vote must be honoured in the least damaging way. The other is that Britain’s departure from the European Union is so mistaken that it must be reversed, once again with least damage.More than three years on some of us are still juggling, even as Boris Johnson heads to Brussels. The thing that keeps the juggling alive is not, in the end, an inability to make up our minds. I am a remainer. Full stop. The question is how to respond to Brexit in the political circumstances of the moment, in the best long-term interests of the country as a whole? The answer has evolved. But it will soon be make-our-minds-up time.Back in 2016 my response to the leave victory was to lament it bitterly but to say that Britain should continue to hug Europe as close as possible, even while leaving. This would help to protect jobs, secure the Irish peace process, and allow Scotland’s remain vote to be treated with enough respect to avoid Brexit becoming a threat to the union. A decade or so down the line, my rationale went, it might then be possible to reopen the question of EU membership, especially if the EU had continued to evolve in a multispeed manner, and if post-Jeremy Corbyn Labour had got off the fence to support Britain’s place in Europe.Instead, the longer that process has gone on, the wider the gap has grown between the original democratic deference owed to the idea of “leaving” in 2016 and the real-world consequences of the detailed version on offer in 2019. Simultaneously, however, the passage of time has made no difference at all to one very big thing: the concern among many leave voters that what they wanted in 2016 has still not happened. To reconcile these two realities is almost impossible, because it pits the malleable pragmatism of representative government against the rigid mandate of government by populist referendum.As the process has lengthened, so the options have widened. This isn’t the conspiracy that some claim to see. It is simply the entropy of politics at work. Few talked about a second referendum back in 2016. But the issue is central to the debate now. Almost no one in 2016, certainly not Johnson, imagined the UK leaving the EU with no deal at all. Today, despite the ongoing talks, no deal is a Johnson government policy option. In the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, reversing the 2016 result had few supporters. Today it is the policy of the Liberal Democrats and the SNP and both are prospering in the polls.There is no perfect choice to be made on Brexit. The fault with that lies in the way the referendum process was devised – verdict first, terms later. All the options come with risks, often very big ones. But we don’t solve anything by wishing we could have made better choices at previous turnings along the way. The here and now choice takes two forms. The first is between Johnson’s deal, no deal and remaining in the EU. The other, which applies as much to hardline leavers as it does to remainers, is between folding and fighting on.The case for Johnson’s deal is that it means Britain leaves the EU in line with the referendum vote. That’s not a minor civic consideration. People are weary and angry. A deal could draw some of the worst poison from public attitudes to politics. It would satisfy the many (more than some of us want to think) who just want the whole thing over, although in reality almost everything about Britain’s future relationship with the EU is still to be decided. It might, if you agree with Corbyn, allow a general election to be fought on “real”, that is to say domestic, economic and social issues.But it would still be a terrible deal and that can’t be ignored, however weary we are. It would mean buying a pig in a poke and hoping that what’s inside entails a good future for the British people. It would defer rather than solve the Irish border crisis. It would risk breaking up the union. It would instantly worsen the UK’s trading position, with severe short- and long-term impacts on the economy and jobs. It would weaken the UK in the negotiations during the transition period. And it would set Britain at odds with its only true geographic and regional allies.The lesson of the past three years needs to be faced. That lesson is not that politicians are out of touch or failing to listen. It is the opposite. It’s not that the country can get along with Brexit. It is the opposite of that too. The lesson is that Brexit won’t work.Brexit won the vote. But it’s an ideology not a policy. When its supporters tried to turn it into policies, as they are still trying to do, it fell apart. It made things worse. These three years have been the leavers’ fault and no one else’s. That’s why obstructing no deal has been so important.But it’s also why preventing Johnson’s deal is important too. Optimism and slapdash policy will not make Britain a global power. Theresa May was right when she said Brexit means Brexit. That’s exactly what’s wrong with it. It’s why, in the end, Britain has to do everything possible to retain its place in Europe, in spite of the difficulties, and persuade its people in a new campaign – not with a message of fear, but with a message that pro-Europeans are listening to what’s wrong with the country.It certainly will not be easy. Most battles are not fought on ground of one’s own choosing. But as long as the passage of time and the sheer folly of Brexit permit the possibility of remaining, Britain should make up its mind to remain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f40e8f3a8b79a3179dc869732051c166fbc24d1/492_207_5268_3161/master/5268.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=264e02f1c31cafbf41f4cf58e2042f6a","title":"free tv licence ends over 75s bbc","story":"The government should reverse this unkind decision, which will rob many older people of their chief companionIt’s not the biggest austerity measure this decade, and it certainly won’t gain the most attention, but there’s one Conservative cut that’s quietly lining up to cause significant harm: taking the free TV licence away from people over the age of 75.The free licences were introduced by Labour in 1999 as part of a plan to improve conditions for pensioners, with the cost funded by government. But in 2015, the Conservatives announced they would phase this out by 2020 and push the financial burden on to the BBC, despite making a manifesto promise to keep up the £745m a year funding. Unable to cover the cost, and after a lengthy consultation, the BBC says it will need all those aged 75 or over to pay the £154.50 annual fee from next June, apart from those who can show they claim the means-tested pension credit.Now new research by Labour from the House of Commons library estimates that more than half a million older people with dementia could lose their free licence as a result of the policy. That includes 140,000 aged 90 or over.This has always been a cruel cut, and the latest research confirms it. For many, the TV is more than a box in the corner of the room: it’s a friendly voice, when you’ve not talked to someone in a week, or a humming light in a dark night. Four out of 10 older people say television is “their main company”, something that is all the more the case for the half of all over-75s who live with a disability. That it’s affecting those with dementia – who may well struggle to fill in the forms – is not only a sign of how low the policy sinks but of how flawed means testing is as a solution. Means testing is notoriously complex it’s estimated it would cost £72m to administer the new system, money that could be spent helping older and isolated people. We also know that means testing leads to large numbers of those in need missing out some are in hardship but don’t meet the strict poverty threshold, and some don’t know about the benefits, while others are reluctant to claim (frequently the case with older people, who often internalise a desire to “stand on their own two feet”).Besides, this is a matter of principle as much as practicality. That some retirees are wealthy is often used as an argument against blanket benefits, but the universal provision at the centre of free licences holds great value: no matter who you are, all older pensioners are entitled to a dignified retirement.Removing the free TV licence is more chipping away at social programmes that have been dismantled in recent years, something that is all the more grim at a time of growing pensioner hardship. The number of pensioners in poverty has risen from 1.6 million three years ago to 1.9 million, and is estimated to top 2 million by 2022. As Gordon Brown, who as chancellor introduced the free licence, has warned, cutting this support becomes worse still when you consider failure to pay a TV licence is a criminal (not civil) offence, resulting in a fine or even imprisonment. It is not outlandish to imagine an 80-year-old hauled to a magistrates hearing because they have lost their free licence and failed to pay up: one in every 10 court cases is already over non-payment of TV licences. The issue with the TV licence support scheme has never been that it is too generous, but that it is not quite generous enough. Disabled and chronically ill people of working age can be just as likely to be isolated because of poor health and poverty, but they don’t get the same support as their older counterparts. I’ve spoken to several disabled people in recent years who have had to give up their television because they could no longer afford the licence, often owing to having their disability benefit cut. Already isolated, their only social lifeline was removed. You only have to talk to those who have been caught without a TV licence to know the system too often essentially criminalises people for being poor, unwell or even illiterate.Boris Johnson seems keen to announce public spending pledges – why not reverse the decision to end the free TV licence? If humane reasons aren’t enough, consider the economic arguments. Like many social programmes, it’s not a stretch to imagine that the free licence ultimately saves the government money a London School of Economics study of older people in 2017 found loneliness costs £6,000 per person in health costs and pressure on local services, and for every £1 spent in preventing loneliness there are up to £3 of savings. It’s often said that austerity measures are implemented by governments that know the cost of everything but the value of nothing. As isolated older people risk losing their only window on to the outside world, ministers might want to consider what really matters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c4dd98b83b1267e411dc4a052d453d04776b4c9/561_965_5825_3495/master/5825.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e36d4203576c248f8a762a75bd7a483e","title":"labour trigger ballot deselection campaign","story":"Unless you’re fixated on the intricate details of Labour’s internal processes, you’ll be forgiven for assuming that any MP who is critical of Jeremy Corbyn can expect to be booted out of the parliamentary party. There is currently a drip, drip of stories coming out about Labour MPs being “triggered”. But the reality is that, far from facilitating a Corbynite takeover, the trigger-ballot battles taking place across the country have allowed the Labour leader’s critics to come out largely unscathed and better organised than ever.In the summer, ahead of a likely early general election, the party began its trigger-ballot process. It is a system that gives ordinary members a choice: automatically reselect your MP as a candidate, or trigger a full selection process, which could bring in a different challenger. Under new rules, an MP is “triggered” when the request for a full selection is made by either a third of local party branches or a third of affiliate branches, such as trade unions.And so the votes started across the country. Diane Abbott, Emily Thornberry, the Labour leader himself and dozens of others flew through their triggers and were unanimously reselected. The fact that pro-Corbyn figures had an easy time of it surprised nobody. Contrary to the impression you may have gained from reading news reports of triggers, what has stunned insiders is the sheer number of Corbyn sceptics who haven’t been triggered.Tom Watson, Liz Kendall, Neil Coyle, Jess Phillips, Siobhain McDonagh, Alison McGovern, Rachel Reeves, Ruth Smeeth, Gareth Snell, Wes Streeting – these are all names associated with the so-called “moderate” wing of the party, and yet all have been automatically reselected. It helps that some of the most passionately anti-Corbyn MPs walked out voluntarily earlier in the year, of course. But the bottom line is that, last month, Boris Johnson kicked out his internal critics and Jeremy Corbyn didn’t. Although you wouldn’t know it from coverage of triggers, Corbyn-sceptic organisers are largely delighted and Corbynites deeply disappointed.Those who have been triggered – Diana Johnson, Margaret Hodge, Roger Godsiff, Emma Lewell-Buck, Kate Osamor and Virendra Sharma – are disproportionately female and BAME. This trend is likely to be more obvious once all triggers are completed. But politically they are a mixed bag. The isions that caused them to be subject to full selections do not run along traditional factional lines: each triggering was a result of constituency party idiosyncrasies, rather than “left””right” battles.Hodge has openly called Corbyn an “antisemite and racist”. It was assumed when she was triggered that this would be the key factor – and yet that was not the case. She and Diana Johnson both saw remarkably low turnout at their meetings, indicating there was no great push to oust them, but rather a failure to organise, or a faulty strategy. The Osamor result can be traced back to long-standing tensions between minority ethnic and religious groups in Enfield, among other factors. Lewell-Buck’s party has been suspended and put into special measures in the recent past, while Sharma’s is currently in special measures. These are specific, non-factional issues. Momentum is not claiming credit for these triggers.Keep in mind that this handful of MPs have only been triggered, not deselected. We can fully expect that almost all of those who are triggered will go on to win their selection contests. Why? Incumbents will have their local organisational structures kicked into gear, plus they are automatically included on the shortlist. This has actually been a chance for MPs to identify where their support is strongest and weakest, and to re-energise their base. It is odd to think that this time last year, one of Labour’s affiliated trade unions privately predicted that there would be 40 MPs deselected. We now know there will only be around a dozen triggered, and far fewer ultimately voted out.Why has the Labour left has failed to reshape the parliamentary party through triggers? With parliamentary selections paused, there was little clarity about what was to come, and members wondered why they should incur the risk of the party imposing the replacement candidate. Labour First and similar organisations on the Corbyn-sceptic wing of the party persuaded MPs “under threat” to stay in their constituencies over the summer and during conference and work their local parties.Most importantly, the defeat is attributable to events at Labour conference 2018. That is when Momentum lost their push for open selections, or “mandatory reselections”, which would have effectively “triggered” all Labour MPs before every election. Instead, the party settled on a compromise: the lower threshold. This has kept in place an antagonistic process, offered the media several negative stories a week about Labour infighting, and bolstered the organisational infrastructure and morale of Corbyn-sceptics.Far from triggers constituting a Corbynite takeover, Momentum is now being described by triumphant survivors of the process as a “paper tiger”. The network has been hugely successful at winning internal elections, and its venture into policy proved effective at Labour conference last month. But it has missed a crucial opportunity to turf out Corbyn’s detractors. Parliamentary selections in 26 defection and retirement seats are the Labour left’s final chance to create a pro-leadership Labour party in the House of Commons – the results of those contests will be key to the success of Corbynism.• Sienna Rodgers is editor of LabourList"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f567351ffa24fd62588a33c00d23d8f8b0ca2155/0_112_3349_2009/master/3349.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a44287af7a8b80e74aa7560c7be2a429","title":"squad bernie sanders progressive 2020","story":"That AOC, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib are endorsing Sanders rather than Warren makes perfect senseLooks like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a “Bernie Bro” now. After months of speculation about whether the progressive congresswoman would endorse Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren for president, she is set to throw her weight behind Sanders at a campaign rally on Saturday.AOC isn’t the only member of the Squad who is Team Bernie. Ilhan Omar endorsed the Vermont senator for president on Wednesday morning, with a video explaining that she is “one of the people that was inspired by the movement that the senator has built”. Rashida Tlaib is also expected to endorse Sanders.The Squad are unashamedly progressive. Sanders is the most progressive candidate. The fact that Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and Tlaib are backing him should come as little surprise. And yet the idea that female politicians would endorse an old white guy instead of Warren, an old white woman, seemed to throw a number of people for a loop.Jane Eisner, for example, director of academic affairs at Columbia Journalism School tweeted: “I find it fascinating that women of color overlook female and minority candidates to endorse a white guy. Is ‘identity politics’ over? Is ideology more important than race and gender? Genuinely curious.”I’ll tell you what I find fascinating: the fact that the concept of “identity politics” has become so thoroughly distorted that people seem to think it means voting for the candidate that looks most like you, or shares your sexual preferences, their policies be damned. The idea that “women of colour” would align themselves with a candidate simply because of their sex or skin colour is incredibly condescending. You also can’t ask whether ideology is more important than race and gender, because the three are not separate, stand-alone entities. But as a “woman of colour” I can tell you right now that ideology is far more important than skin-deep representation.Here’s the thing: if Sanders and Warren were completely interchangeable in their politics then it would make sense to get behind Warren because she is a woman. America is way overdue a female president. But while Warren and Sanders may be far more to the left than the rest of the Democrats, their politics are not identical. Warren has made it clear that she is a capitalist while Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist. That difference isn’t a small question of semantics – it’s reflective of a fundamentally different world view.I like Warren, don’t get me wrong. But, for me, one of the most important differences between the two is that Sanders is more progressive when it comes to foreign policy. (And I’d like to remind all the people who seem to think that Warren is far more of a feminist than Sanders that women outside America matter as well.) Warren isn’t a war-mongerer but she seems to be more concerned with ensuring the military is environmentally friendly rather than putting an end to American imperialism. Sanders, on the other hand, has spent his entire life speaking out about the horrors of American foreign policy. Which, of course, has done him zero favours politically: nothing makes you more unpopular with the establishment in this country than suggesting that America isn’t always a force for good in the world.That AOC, Omar, and Tlaib are endorsing Sanders rather than Warren makes perfect sense from an ideological point of view. Their worldviews are far more aligned to Sanders than they are Warren’s. The more important question, perhaps, is just how significant this endorsement actually is. There are currently three schools of thought on this: 1 It doesn’t make any difference 2 It helps Sanders because it makes him seem more relevant 3 It helps Warren because it makes her seem less radical.My own view is that, in terms of the primary, it makes very little difference. Sanders isn’t going to get the nomination because the Squad endorsed him, nor will it take a significant number of votes from Warren. But this isn’t to say that the endorsement isn’t significant. Having three prominent women of colour vocalize their support for Sanders makes it harder for the media to keep pushing the ridiculous idea that he doesn’t connect with women or people of colour. It makes it harder to erase his female following and pretend that his only fans are irritating Bernie Bros.The Squad’s endorsement is also a reminder that Sanders has done more than any other politician to push America leftwards and make topics like Medicare for All and free education mainstream talking points. As Omar herself said, he has built a movement and inspired a new generation of democratic socialists. There are plenty of people itching for Sanders to drop out of the race and go away, but it’s not going to be that easy to get rid of him, I’m afraid. Bernie may never become president, but he has already started a revolution in America."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d0e45b7e7583593edf92277fc0a37a5a3623026/0_199_4246_2549/master/4246.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3e2fe533205121c80b454b2943dec31","title":"democrat letter google stop funding climate change deniers","story":"Kathy Castor’s letter to Sundar Pichai says it’s hard to ‘overstate the detrimental impact’ groups have had on the climate debate A Democratic lawmaker has called on Google CEO Sundar Pichai to stop investing in organizations that deny the existence of the climate crisis, saying it was hard to overstate how detrimental the impact of such groups had been on the US climate debate.Kathy Castor’s letter to Pichai followed a report in the  last week that revealed Google had made “substantial” contributions to some of the most notorious climate deniers in Washington, despite the internet giant’s insistence it supports political action to combat the crisis.The groups included the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which has actively sought to roll back Obama-era environmental protections and helped convince Donald Trump, the US president, to abandon the Paris Agreement.Google has said it supported the climate accord, but continued to offer financial backing to CEI and similarly-minded groups.“It is hard to overstate the detrimental impact groups like CEI have had on the climate debate in the United States since the early days of the Kyoto Protocol,” Castor, a Democratic representative from Florida, said. “Because of their public and behind-the-scenes efforts to obfuscate and obstruct, we have lost critical time to cut greenhouse gas pollution and now face a shrinking window of opportunity to avert the worst impacts of climate change.”Google has said that its support for CEI and other groups, including the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation, reflected support for the groups’ “strong technology policies”, and not their stance on the climate crisis.“We’ve been extremely clear that Google’s sponsorship doesn’t mean that we endorse that organization’s entire agenda – we may disagree strongly on some issues,” a Google spokesperson told the  about its donations.But in her letter to Pichai, Castor, who is chair of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, said there was no way to distinguish their support from other issues.“It is impossible to separate your support for one sliver of CEI from the whole. Your financial contributions support the organization’s infrastructure, augment its political influence, and, in turn, legitimize all of its activities – not just the ones you like,” she wrote.Google declined to offer new comment on the letter, and referred to previous statements on the issue.Castor closed her letter by pointing to Google’s own website, and its declaration that the company was striving to “build sustainability into everything we do”.“I urge you to apply this mantra when you make decisions about which thinktanks and organizations to support in the future,” she said.It was not the only public response to the ’s report last week, which was part of a broader investigation into the fossil fuel industry, the structures behind it, and the climate emergency.Activists with Extinction Rebellion staged a protest in front of Google’s London headquarters on Wednesday, with more than 100 mothers – and babies – staging a “nurse-in” to protest the company’s funding of climate deniers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5be196b54a2962e1a8382a662080fe76138855ce/179_0_5022_3015/master/5022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0928611701de36fb9e2c2245fa6030f","title":"wildlife photographer of the year 2019 winners in pictures","story":"Hailing from the Chinese province of Qinghai, Yongqing Bao has won the prestigious wildlife photographer of the year 2019 title for his image The Moment, which frames the standoff between a Tibetan fox and a marmot.

Jürgen Klopp uses tactics grounded in Rangnick’s fast transitions and his Liverpool team have four players who owe their big break in Europe to Rangnick: Joël Matip (at Schalke), Roberto Firmino (Hoffenheim), Naby Keïta and Sadio Mané (RB Salzburg).Rangnick is a byword for tactical influence and talent development in Germany, even taking some credit for the national team’s 2014 World Cup success. This season’s Bundesliga has been nicknamed the “Rangnickliga”, as five teams in the top six positions have head coaches who learned their craft under him.The personable German, 61, has embraced a new role as head of sport and development at Red Bull, looking after teams in New York and São Paulo, where the newly purchased Bragantino are on the verge of promotion to the Brazilian top-flight.It is a change from last year, when he combined the jobs of sporting director and head coach at RB Leipzig, keeping the coach’s seat warm for Julian Nagelsmann, who arrived from Hoffenheim in the summer. Leipzig finished third and reached the German Cup final. “This only worked because all the players we had in the squad were those I had already signed as sporting director, so we had an existing relationship,” Rangnick tells the . “It would have been impossible to do both in the long term.”The pillars of his sporting director role encompass everything on the football side: the first team, academy, medical set-up and recruitment. “We see it like a jigsaw with 500 pieces, and our role is to ensure that we have each piece available to help every player improve. We help every inidual in the whole club develop and flourish.”Rangnick looks back with pride at his work with Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg, whom he left in 2015. Leipzig were in the fourth ision when he joined and are now realistic Bundesliga title contenders. Salzburg are breaking scoring records in Austria (46 goals in 10 games) and had a stunning start to their Champions League campaign, beating Genk 6-2 and losing 4-3 at Liverpool.“We can see where they are now and say we took the correct decisions at the time that gives us a good feeling.” Both clubs have spent money but Rangnick makes the point that they are not the only ones. Salzburg have made a profit of more than €200m in player sales in the past five years.Rangnick fell in love with English football as a 21-year-old student on a year abroad at Sussex University, as part of his English and PE degree from Stuttgart University. He remembers going to the Goldstone Ground and watching Brighton lose 4-1 to Liverpool. “I remember the Brighton fans singing: ‘Seagulls! Seagulls!’ despite the scoreline. And the Liverpool fans responded: ‘Seaweed! Seaweed!’ Scouse humour, huh?”He famously played for the local non-league side Southwick FC, 11 games that moulded him as a coach: “The most important thing for me was the amount of coaching we did on the pitch,” he says. “We always spurred each other on, coaching among ourselves or motivating each other. That was inspirational for me.”Now Rangnick is the inspiration, a poster boy for a sporting director model that is increasingly popular in the Premier League – with one obvious exception. Manchester United let it be known they wanted a director of football more than a year ago but no appointment has followed.So would Rangnick, a sporting director with a proven track record, be interested in an approach from Old Trafford? “I am happy where I am but if any club wanted to speak to me, the question would have to be: ‘Can I be somebody who can influence areas of development across the whole club?’ Otherwise you are only getting half of what I am capable of. If, after that, you can work together in a trustworthy and respectful way, then you are more likely to be successful.”Rangnick understands the reluctance of some clubs to change a traditional set-up. “It’s always difficult to follow someone like Sir Alex Ferguson, who was so successful and in place for a long time – and that’s even harder if you are often changing coaches,” he says. “With every coaching change, the identity changes and this is reflected in the sporting development. You can look at the money that team has had available in the last five years and say there has been an underperformance.”It is no coincidence, he adds, that the two teams currently dominating the Premier League have a clear playing style. “They have their identity and know what they need to develop, and so it’s no coincidence that they are dominating the league.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93c8060c99953feb4e54da07a672744378eef22c/0_253_5723_3434/master/5723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8e38fd11399ceeaa61872f043db83c1","title":"san marino european football worst top division team matt walker book","story":"Björn, the wicked barman I met in Finland, was cutting. “San Marino is like the Åland Islands having their own league. You only need two barely functional legs and to be aged 18 to 40.” I was now 41, but San Marino was surely my best chance of playing a match on my travels.San Marino was the lowest-ranked league based on club results in European competition over the previous five seasons. Only Kosovo, unable to accrue ranking points until they became a member of Uefa in 2016, had a lower coefficient. My chances of playing were improved further by watching the final round of matches in the regular league season. And I even chose a dead match, Murata against Virtus, involving the worst team in top‑ision European football.Murata had drawn one and lost 18 of their league matches and had a goal difference of minus 50.I spoke to Matteo, an Italian follower of my travels who compiles San Marino statistics – appearances, goals and subjective attributes such as player values – for the computer game Football Manager. “That’s quite impossible,” he said when I asked about getting a game.Understandable, I guessed, this being a Uefa league and not suitable for a washed-out amateur. But it wasn’t my lack of talent. “San Marino has a foreigners limit of seven, so it is unlikely the teams will leave a blank spot for you.” Even Italians were classified as foreigners unless they lived in the country.I was in San Marino for two days in the spring sunshine. The views were astounding from the city walls: the Adriatic to the east, a snowy rut of mountains to the west. I walked through St Francis’s Gate, where a policeman was needlessly directing the limited traffic, and spotted some young English cyclists. They were wearing the instantly recognisable purple of Durham University, where I was president of the Football Supporters’ Society for one glorious year.I met Luca from the San Marino Football Federation by the Palazzo Pubblico and gave a short interview for San Marino TV. Luca explained that notional home and away teams were randomly allocated to stadiums in San Marino. The league format was the most curious in Europe, with 15 teams split into two leagues – one of eight, another of seven – and the top three from each playing off for the title and European places over a further six rounds.San Marino had the craziest league with the latest kick-off times. My match started at 9.15pm. As in Andorra and Gibraltar, most of the players had been working during the day. Luca explained that San Marinese footballers tried to gain experience in amateur, semi‑professional or professional leagues in Italy. Although some played in San Marino because it was easier to manage the three essentials: work, family and football.I asked about Davide Gualtieri. The bored-looking cameraman who spoke no English suddenly laughed. England needed to beat San Marino and pray to qualify for the 1994 World Cup. I vividly remember Stuart Pearce playing the underhit back pass that Gualtieri converted in the ninth second.“He’s running an IT business now and he’s the supplier for the San Marino Football Federation. Everybody from abroad who talks about San Marino football says ‘Gualtieri, nine seconds’.”His fame had spread to Scotland, where his holidaying brother had been bought drinks and a meal by jubilant Scots.Murata against Virtus was being played at the Fiorentino ground, three miles downhill from the historic centre. Luca estimated 30 minutes’ walk, but I’m always sceptical about walking times quoted by people who drive everywhere. And San Marino is the king of cars. In 2014, the World Bank listed San Marino as having the highest number of cars per capita (1,263 per 1,000 people) of any country. “I didn’t know this statistic, maybe it’s some Italians with licence plates registered here,” said Luca.I soon found that the biggest danger was the cars. The road clearly wasn’t designed for the few pedestrians in San Marino and I had to sidestep every time a car passed to make sure the vehicle didn’t clip me in the darkness. I really didn’t want to die in San Marino as I still had to get to Luxembourg the following day. After an hour’s walk, I was relieved to be greeted by the incessant barking of a white dog outside the ground.I sat in the small stand and tried to ignore the irony that my longest walk to a stadium was in one of the world’s smallest countries. A bushy tabby cat dashed the full length of the pitch. I introduced myself to Giuseppe Canine, ‘Joseph Dogs’ he laughed, an Italian cameraman who was filming for a television highlights package. I was surprised by Giuseppe’s English. He had never been to England and had visited the United States once. “I learnt it from John Denver songs I translated them into Italian.” He certainly spoke with a country twang.Giuseppe recounted that an Italian journalist had visited a few years earlier and asked people whether they felt San Marinese or Italian. Everyone answered “San Marinese”. Giuseppe said that Italians would always think about themselves first and their country second. But not in patriotic San Marino.There certainly weren’t many cultural differences, but Luca had explained that some Italians still felt a rivalry with the micro-state. “San Marino has been seen as an offshore paradise when salaries were higher than in Italy for the same job. Even if the situation changes, the mentality doesn’t change.”This match had a retrospective feel. Both teams lined up in shirts numbered one to 11 in their normal positions. I was backing Murata, who were title winners three times in the mid-2000s but had struggled with finances and failed to attract better-quality players this season. They used to have a famous player Aldair, the Roma and Brazil defender, had made 10 appearances at the age of 41. The club had even attempted to lure Michael Schumacher to play in their 2008 Champions League campaign. Luca thought Murata had a good chance to break their duck because Virtus might be focused on their Titano Cup quarter-final.The scoring inevitably slowed but winger Tedesco secured his hat-trick with the best goal of the night, a left-foot volley that zipped off the artificial pitch into the corner.Zannoni, a latter-day Andrea Pirlo, flicked a pass with the outside of his right boot – “pass bellissimo,” purred a voice behind me – for striker Ura to make it 8–1 to Virtus.Only 22 people, one dog and a passing cat watched this thrashing, the lowest attendance and joint highest-scoring match of my travels.Giuseppe secured his precious camera memory cards in a jar. I asked for a lift and saved my legs from a lengthy trek up the mountain. “You will be OK in Luxembourg,” said Giuseppe. “At least it’s flat for walking.”This is an edited chapter from Matt Walker’s Europe United, published by Quercus Books and available as a hardcover or ebook."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09535a5849a60941ed8512a0e412e52b1cdd368/264_83_1175_705/master/1175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f028253c65572ccb0bb9534930bfb7d2","title":"buy a classic david squires cartoon from our collection","story":"Our cartoonist looks back at 25 of his favourite strips from down the years, all of which are now available at our  Print Shop, a link to each can be found by clicking on the title of each caption below"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/024d1060c0e44e040fa378269b7f91df6354421b/0_161_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=580e84d4b6d35fd7e0adc10e7c37d914","title":"nigers president blames explosive birth rate on a misreading of islam","story":"Mahamadou Issoufou calls for ‘responsible parenthood’ as he warns population boom will undermine climate adaptationA misreading of Islam led to Niger’s explosive birth rate, hampering the country’s fight to adapt to the climate crisis and preserve its shrinking resources, the country’s president told the .Feted by Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel as one of Africa’s most articulate leaders, Mahamadou Issoufou stressed that this nexus of issues is set to have an increasingly direct impact on European politics, warning migration may exceed the levels seen during the second world war.“Everything is connected in a global village. As they say, a butterfly flaps its wings in Brazil and there can be a tornado in Houston,” he said.Issoufou claims he has been slowly driving down his country’s birth rate of more than seven children per woman, the highest birth rate in the world for the past decade.He told the : “Before Islam came, women used to be married at the age of 18, but due to a misreading of Islam, young women were having babies at the age of 12 or 13. But what does the Qur’an say? If an educated person reads the Qur’an, it talks about responsible parenthood. Islam says you should only have children if you can take good care of them and properly educate them.“Schools need to educate young girls because we do not want them having children at 12 or 13. Ideally, we want to keep them in school as long as possible, until age 18. This is something new to us.”With the spread of contraception and family planning schools for men, the birth rate has slowly declined to about six children per woman, but more needs to be done, the president said. The last official figures from the World Bank in 2016 put the rate at 7.2 children per woman.He knows the scale of migration from Niger – one of the poorest countries in the world – depends on how the climate crisis progresses, but Issoufou warned that the Sahel will be one of the main contributors to the predicted 230m migrants by 2050, a figure he points out will be far larger than the mass migration caused by the second world war. “The people of Niger may not fully understand the causes of this, but they are experiencing it in their daily lives. They do know there is a link between degradation of soil and their poverty. The world worries about a rise of two degrees, but we have already experienced that increase since the 60s.”He added: “There is a growing risk of anger across Africa as the people come to realise the root cause of this evil. As people come to understand the causes of climate change, it could lead to the finding of solutions, but equally it may lead to anger and social turmoil.”“Those least responsible for the climate change suffer its worst consequences. The situation is not helped when industrialised nations do not always deliver on their promises.”Earlier this year, Issoufou was involved in the launch of a $400bn (£311bn) climate investment plan for the Sahel region.The precise extent to which climate change and demography in Africa could lead to migration into Europe is disputed, with most saying it will lead mainly to internal migration within Africa. A World Bank report last year claimed that if no action is taken, sub-Saharan Africa may have as many as 86 million internal climate migrantsby 2050.Issoufou argues that much depends on Africa’s ability to find jobs for this new labour force, which in turn hangs on the continent’s ability to grow in the model of Asian economies, and to integrate economically.As chair of the Economic Community of West African States, Issoufou has been involved in plans to build a pan-African free trade zone of 1.2 billion people, now supported by 54 African states. He said the aim is to end what he describes as “the Balkanisation of the continent by colonialists”. The free trade zone came into force this summer, and Issoufou now talks of “marching boldly” towards a single currency for Africa, a plan that may meet widespread resistance.Unlike Asia, he argued, “Africa had remained chained in the colonial pact, that is to say supplier of raw materials and consumer of finished products manufactured elsewhere. She remains a victim of unequal exchange.”His critics claim Issoufou has become a victim of an unequal exchange himself. In 2015, Niger – at the EU’s request – became the first country to criminalise people-smuggling, a move that has badly disrupted the hidden economy of the north.The EU gave Niger €610 (£526) to police what has effectively become Africa’s new border with Europe in the wake of the collapse of Libya. The aim was to slow the flow of migrants into Libya which led to mass migration across the Mediterranean into Italy, peaking in 2017, and prompting the rise of the populist right. One issue with the approach is whether those who have been forced out of smuggling have received the EU aid designed to give them a different way of life.Issoufou makes no apology for being the gendarmerie of illegal migration. “I am not prepared to see Africans die in transit in the heat of the Sahara or exploited by smuggling rings,” he said. European lectures on the consequences of the Libyan intervention do not impress him. He first heard about the fateful Franco-British intervention of Libya in 2011 on the radio. “It has left us in a state close to chaos ever since.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a1f68319f058e7f158e62fea58e8e77d259e9f8/0_39_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f09305359c86459d2b747a820e21c8bd","title":"soap opera could be unlikely form birth control uganda","story":"An NGO has recut and overdubbed a Venezuelan telenovela to raise awareness of sexual healthUganda has one of the highest birth rates in the world.

Soap operas are expensive to make, however, so they plan instead to “hack” a Venezuelan import, recutting the existing series and overdubbing it with Ugandan actors.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theUsing content originally from Nacer Contigo (Reborn), the new show has been rescripted and turned into a programme titled Love \u0026amp Wealth.

Civil society groups have launched a lawsuit against the government over its failure to issue a comprehensive sex education policy in schools, after a crackdown on reproductive education.A report recently linked a lack of sex education to a rise in teenage pregnancies and new HIVAids infections in adolescents.Telenovelas have proved to be successful imports in sub-Saharan Africa.Robert Mawerere, the head of programming at NTV, one of Uganda’s most popular broadcasters, said Ugandans loved telenovelas, whether they were Mexican, Filipino, Indian or Chinese, “as long as they are romantic, dramatic and with fantasy”.William Nyombi, the program manager for Marie Stopes Uganda, said they could be an effective way of getting across messages related to social behavioural change.“A young person (or) a lady will tell you a whole story of a telenovela, so it has impact,” he said.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Members share photography from retro cookbooks (like this picture of a mutilated sea bass reconstructed with a conga line of gelatin-ensconced shrimp on its back) or jiggle videos of various jellies being ked with spoons (those are my favorite).Some of it is appetizing, much of it is emphatically not, but all of it qualifies as “oddly satisfying”, a category of web content that emerged from Reddit in 2013 and encapsulates a variety of quotidian-yet-hypnotic stuff – like watching people cut soap or squeeze slime.The question of why some people find wobbly Jell-O so appealing is subjective. According to a Facebook post by my fellow group member, University of the Pacific food historian Ken Albala, gelatin’s allure lies in:“The irresistible jiggle, threatening collapse with every twist and turn. The thrill of the spoon smoothly cleaving its slick glossy flesh. Then in the mouth, that bounce, the subtle firmness that first resists then gently yields to the pressure of the teeth.”But that’s just one guy’s opinion. For the rest of us, wiggle videos may provide anxiety-reducing ASMR. Philosopher Evan Malone has even made a case for the phenomenon of “odd satisfaction” being a product of the grace of witnessing a “perfect fit”.What is clear is that jelly’s charms are catching on: lately, the worlds of fashion and art have also been ready for some jelly.To wit: for SS20, Balenciaga showed three gowns, domed like gelatin molds and bouncing with their wearer’s every step. At Alexander McQueen, Kaia Gerber, her face gleaming with highlighter, wore a petal-like confection evocative of the flowers fluted into 3D jelly cakes (artistic desserts popular in Mexico and Vietnam). At Issey Miyake, dresses horizontally striped with juicy colors descended from the ceiling, pouring over models who jiggled joyfully inside them.Then there is the contemporary Irish designer Sinéad O’Dwyer, who molds silicone directly on her models, creating vividly colored garments flaunting the suggestive visual metaphor between jelly and flesh.Gelatin is also relevant to the art world, where its moldability makes it a useful medium for experimentation.Since 2007, culinary artists Bompas \u0026amp Parr have been crafting jelly architecture, like a zesty orange version of Buckingham Palace. Their work also inspired photographer Jenny van Sommers to create her mesmerizing The Jelly Film, in which four jellies express their personalities through dance (just watch it).More recently, as observed in the New York Times Magazine, queer and female artists have drawn upon gelatin’s fleshy sensuality, camp appeal and associations with feminine domesticity to inform their work.Artist Alison Kuo (another Show Me Your Aspics member) engaged “notions of sacrifice” by manhandling Jell-O in a live performance piece in Manhattan early this year. Artist duo Lazy Mom and photographer Joseph Maida both use gelatin in their jolie laide subversions of Instagram aesthetics. Sharona Franklin, a disabled artist whose sculptures recall her reliance on transgenic medicine, creates found object-filled jellies so eccentrically chic that this week, fashion copycat watchdog Diet Prada posted allegations that Gucci plagiarized her.Yet what if you cannot reconcile jelly’s growing appeal with its slaughterhouse origins, and are distressed that the worldwide gelatin industry itself is on the rise – estimated to be worth $4bn by 2024?In that case, consider casting your lot in not with art but science. Synthetic biology startup Geltor aims to have the first lab-grown vegan gelatin to market in 2020.In search of the optimal wobble, the company used genetically engineered mastodon collagen in its early prototypes.With growing interest in next-gen gelatins, the appeal of jelly is undoubtedly spreading."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d89c813134ddb5ff676c6b6839c0312ccceba06/0_1040_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd351586eefc3862c331f5734c239042","title":"what happens when you try all the cbd products you can find","story":"Would the alleged magic of cannabidiol have an effect on me or is it all snake oils and placebos?Shortly before I sat down to begin writing this, I squirted a 1 milliliter dropper of full-spectrum hemp extract, also known as CBD oil, under my tongue. It contained – according to the bottle – 6.25 mg of CBD per dosage, and tasted – also per the bottle’s label – of cold-pressed oranges.I wasn’t sure what to expect, if anything. But with the mania around CBD approaching fever pitch, I was curious to know if I, too, could in some way be touched by its allegedly remarkable powers of stress reduction, relaxation, and all-around wellbeing. We live in dire times. What’s the harm in trying to get away from it all without actually having to go anywhere?I bought the oil a week ago at the 420 Store, which bills itself as “New York’s first luxury, dedicated CBD store”. Most of its wares are displayed sparingly on pristine white shelves, and run the gamut from bath salts and skin creams to flavored gummies and tinctures. All contain some amount of CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabis compound (different from THC, the plant’s main psychoactive compound).The shop has a self-serious, high-gloss ambience, with a touch of wellness-derived spirituality thrown in, like some hybrid of Sephora and a Burning Man prayer circle. It made me want to laugh, but also made me mad, which is the same reaction I have to most attempts of the wellness industry to commodify and market the myriad stresses that accompany our attempts to exist in the modern world.The 420 Store opened its doors in June, six months after hemp was removed from the FDA’s list of controlled substances. Although there were already plenty of CBD products on the market, this had the effect of ungating a dam suddenly CBD seemed to be everywhere, from bodega counters to subway ads to shiny Soho storefronts to Walgreens. CBD had effectively become the new pumpkin spice, sprinkled on products high and low and everywhere in-between in an attempt to cash in on its alleged magic.CBD is purported to provide relief from a host of bodily ills like inflammation, pain and digestive problems to stress and anxiety. As such, the market is now crowded with CBD-infused chocolate bars, beverages, gummies, body lotions, pills, tinctures, face masks, and pain creams. The products are not limited to humans: a reportedly growing number of pet parents now turn to cannabidiol as the latest remedy to treat their pups.Dr Jordan Tishler founded and has run the Boston-based medical cannabis practice InhaleMD for six years (which in the cannabis world, makes him “one of the old guys”, he said). He’s also an instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. He takes a slightly dim view on the CBD gold rush. “I’m like, this is a side step this is foolishness,” he said. “People are so obsessed with talking about CBD that they’ve stopped talking about cannabis. And at the end of the day, cannabis is what helps my patients. CBD is close to useless.”Topicals, Tishler explained, wouldn’t do anything to me (“They’re another mythology– cannabinoids don’t go through your skin,” he said). Ingestible products such as vapes and oils might have an impact, but have been known to contain heavy metals like arsenic and mercury. The FDA doesn’t regulate cannabis products, and many of them aren’t subjected to third-party laboratory testing. Tishler recommended buying products only from legitimate dispensaries that require a medical marijuana card, which I didn’t have, so I went for the OTC variety.I started with the topicals: TriBeauty’s CBD Superfood Mask, Tribe Revive’s CBD-infused pain cream, TriBeauty’s CBD eye cream, and Uncle Bud’s CBD body lotion. All of them smelled nice the pain cream had a pleasant wintergreen aroma, while the face mask was redolent of pineapple (it doesn’t actually include pineapple, though it does include kale, spinach, and green tea). And all of them were, well, creamy I appreciated their ease of application and lack of discernible oiliness.Did any of them make me feel anything? No. Of course they didn’t the only thing I felt was the menthol in the Tribe Revive pain cream, which made my arm tingle like I’d slathered on Bengay. The amount I was getting from the creams was miniscule, in the ballpark of 1 to 5 mg. The doses that tend to be effective in humans, says Tishler, are 10 to 20 mg per kilogram. “The average human is about 70 kg,” he says. “That’s 700 to 1400 mg of CBD per day. Nobody can get that.”Annoyed but not surprised, I pressed on to ingestibles. I bought the Vitamin Shoppe’s Ancient Nutrition’s organic CBD hemp caplets (10 mg) and Winged’s Happiness “mood support complex”, (15 mg of CBD per soft gel, “uniquely formulated for women”). From the 420 Store, I bought Wyld’s blackberry gummies (25 mg per gummy) Grön’s Fair Trade dark chocolate bar (100 mg per $23.99 bar – yes, you read the price correctly) and Toast’s cold-pressed orange tincture (250 mg of CBD per one-ounce bottle) – the one I took before I started writing this. From TribeTokes, I tried Tribe Tincs’ full-spectrum CBD tincture (1,500 mg of CBD per one-ounce bottle).Had I taken them all at once, I would have easily exceeded the 700 mg mark, but the thought of potentially incapacitating myself with CBD was not appealing. I had a job and shit to do. So I proceeded with some vague sense of moderation.Unlike the lack of effectiveness of the topicals, the ingestibles presented a spectrum of results. On one end were capsules by Winged. One capsule’s evening primrose oil and “good mood complex”, it read, “may support balanced hormone levels as well as the brain’s ‘happy’ neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine. Get your smile on girl!” Instead, I felt nothing (aside from disgust for the company’s car salesman-esque messaging) .Toast’s tincture did taste and smell just like oranges, as advertised, but was similarly uneventful. As for the Grön bar, it tasted like any other decent artisan chocolate bar, but the idea of eating the whole thing just to glean some kind of purported CBD effect was unappetizing. So I gave up, unaltered.Trying to toe the line between Tishler’s recommended effective dosage, my need to be a functioning adult, and, at this point, determined to feel … something, I took the Tribe Tinc’s prescribed 50 mg dosage. While I disagree with its claim of flavorlessness – to me, it carried a definite note of weedy funk – it did produce a noticeable feeling of general wellbeing, a sense that life had somehow become something I didn’t need to worry about very much.I felt my mind stray from thoughts of deadlines, rising sea levels, and the president’s sphincter-like visage to how beautiful my bag of frozen compost looked when I removed it from the freezer. Whether this was because I took it on the weekend or wasn’t feeling particularly anxious to begin with, I don’t know there’s also the possibility of the (very real) placebo effect. But what I can say is that, for whatever reason, 50 mg of CBD seemed to have a positive effect on me, insofar as it seemed to redirect my mind to a more sunny locale.Likewise, taking one of Wyld’s 25 mg gummies seemed to alter my outlook on the day. It helped that the gummies actually taste like blackberries and are thus delicious they also have a pleasing soft-chewy texture. Not long after taking one, I started to feel somewhat relaxed – so relaxed that I literally walked into traffic later that afternoon (thankfully, it was moving slowly, as was I).For my last adventure in CBD, I decided to go big, and also straight to the source. On a sunny Thursday afternoon, I climbed a flight of stairs to the snug but brightly lit Lower Manhattan office of Tribe Tokes. There I was greeted by Kim Byrnes, the company’s cofounder, who proceeded to guide me through a CBD dab. Byrnes, clad in midriff-bearing athleisure wear (she’s also a longtime pilates instructor) is an incredibly enthusiastic proponent of both CBD and THC – both, she told me, have helped her treat her ulcerative colitis and other ailments. She sounded almost encyclopedic as she talked about the numerous methods of CBD ingestion and their comparative merits.A dab is a highly concentrated form of CBD, containing about 10-15 mg of CBD. You inhale its vapor through a dab rig, a close cousin to the bong. The result, Byrnes said, is a “body high – it feels nice and relaxed and calm”.She put a concentrate of 7 Point Natural’s CBD Terp Sauce, a mix of CBD crystals and cannabis terpenes (organic compounds) in the rig’s nail and heated it up. I sucked the resulting vapor deep into my lungs, and, because I’m a rank amateur, scorched my esophagus. But on my second pull, I managed to get light-headed for a minute, and then felt … fine.It was only after leaving the TribeTokes office that I began to understand what Byrnes was talking about. All of the afternoon’s obstacles seemed to fall away from me, leaving me to walk a clear, gloriously smooth path through the rest of my day. Tourists walking four abreast down the sidewalk? Whatever, I thought. They’re just enjoying my city’s unparalleled beauty. A 15-minute wait for the train home? Not a problem, I thought more time to watch adorable rats frolic on the tracks.I felt beatific rather than annoyed by all of the obstacles the city placed in my path. But more than anything, I felt lucky. I am lucky that I’m at a point in my life where I’m not suffering from aches and pains or even much anxiety, aside from the usual geopolitical-climate-crisis-end-of-days variety. Had I written this story a few months ago, when I was dealing with the aftermath of a terrible relationship and wrenching shoulder and back pain, I might have been much more receptive to the claims being made by the CBD industry. But on this day, I was a contented skeptic.My head felt clear, my limbs felt loose, and the world rolled out its carpet in front of me, beckoning me to bask in the sunshine of my mind’s own invention."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439f901892d115f82c0062fc89f876742715d61c/5_70_2484_1490/master/2484.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf21db453e689800ded24744c3a6e896","title":"nicky morgan open minded about bbc licence fee future","story":"Culture secretary said she would consider it during appearance before select committeeNicky Morgan, the culture secretary, has said she is “open-minded” about scrapping the BBC television licence fee and replacing it with a Netflix-style subscription service.The cabinet minister said she would consider it as an option during a select committee hearing in comments that will delight Tory critics of the broadcaster.She raised the possibility in answer to a question from Julian Knight, the Conservative MP for Solihull, who asked her to consider scrapping the licence fee and suggested a subscription service as a possible policy for the party’s election manifesto.“I’m open minded and I will have decisions and listen to evidence on all sides,” she said, speaking to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee.“What I haven’t seen is any evidence, either way, what a subscription-based system would do in terms of the revenue.“The licence fee last year raised £3.7bn for the BBC. They obviously have other sources of income as well. So I would need to understand what, if you were going to change, that would do to their income.”Sources in her department later suggested that it would not be a priority for Morgan and pointed out that the government has committed to maintain the licence fee funding model for the BBC until 2027 for the duration of the 11-year charter period.However, her comments will boost the hopes of some Tory MPs who dislike the BBC and have long been campaigning for an end to the universal £154.50-a-year licence fee. A subscription service like Netflix would mean people having to opt in to watch programmes on BBC channels and listen to its radio stations.The idea was recently raised by the rightwing Institute for Economic Affairs thinktank, which was welcomed by Knight, who predicted: “Personally, I think the next licence fee will be the last.”In the same hearing, Morgan said she would not intervene in the BBC’s decision to abolish free TV licences for over-75s.She said she had “no plans” to review the BBC’s television licence shake-up, after the broadcaster agreed in 2015 to fund the free licences given to those aged over 75.The BBC announced this year that only low-income households in receipt of pension credits would receive the benefit, meaning around 3.7 million elderly people will have to pay £154.50 a year in future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbdbd6a7bca0a3d1deff7ef88e4583041533a4c7/247_296_5796_3477/master/5796.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f388caac0eca6dba5df7af804c2e01bf","title":"ford urgent safety recall parts repair","story":"When it didn’t have the parts, it suggested the car could be driven despite needing ‘urgent action’I received a letter from the Ford Motor Company advising of a safety recall on my vehicle.

You finally ended up spending 10 days without your car or a courtesy vehicle while parts were shipped in from Germany.Ford’s suggestion to me that you could take your car to the airport provided you top up the coolant level was not reassuring, given the urgency of the recall notice and the implications if the coolant pipes failed.In the US last year Ford undertook to pay for replacement engines after leaking coolant pipes caused overheating damage.Ford says that the recall letters had been sent in waves throughout 2018 and 2019 to ensure sufficient parts were available, potentially leaving drivers at risk of engine failure for up to 12 months.You were finally reunited with your car the day before your holiday and, as you drove it home a warning light signalled an engine malfunction.When you took it back to the dealer it was found that, after replacing the pipes, mechanics had forgotten to top up the coolant! The dealer eventually offered £200 in goodwill.In a way you were lucky. This month the BBC Watchdog programme discovered that 3.4 million cars that had been issued with a safety recall were still awaiting repairs, and that UK drivers are not alerted to some urgent problems that prompt a recall overseas.The UK car recall system relies on manufacturers reporting issues, but there are no standard rules on how serious the problem has to be before it triggers a recall.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

At full pelt, the insects travelled 108 times their body length per second, the researchers found.“They fly through the air with no feet on the ground from stride to stride,” even at relatively slow speeds, said Sarah Pfeffer, who studies animal behaviour at Ulm University in Germany.There is a reason Saharan silver ants, or Cataglyphis bombycina, have evolved to be fleet of foot. Unlike other desert creatures which shelter from the intense noon heat, for the ants it is a prime time to scavenge. When the desert is at its hottest, they emerge from their nests and zip about looking for food – often the carcasses of less fortunate creatures that have succumbed to the brutal temperatures.To survive, the ants have silvery hairs that reflect the sun’s rays. But even with this coating and other adaptations, the ants can barely survive the 60C (140F) heat and need impressive speed and navigational skills to find food and return to the nest before falling victim to the heat themselves.Before Pfeffer and her colleagues could clock the ants racing around the desert, they first had to find them. The scientists travelled to Douz, a town in southern Tunisia, and scoured the nearby dunes for the streaks of silver that are the ants in motion.Having traced some ants back to their nest, the researchers laid an aluminium channel along the ground and placed mealworms or shortbread crumbs at the far end. Above the track they attached a downwards-facing high-speed video camera to record the ants as they tore back and forth.Once slowed down, the footage shows the ants coordinating their movements with incredible precision, moving three legs – which work together as a tripod – at a time. Running flat out, the ants covered 85.5cm per second in 47 strides, more than 10 times Usain Bolt’s stride rate. Between each stride, each ant foot touched the ground for as little as seven milliseconds.Similar footage of another fast desert ant, Cataglyphis fortis, which is found in the Tunisian salt pans, recorded the insects hitting a top speed of 62cm per second. Details are published in the Journal of Experimental Biology.While the Saharan silver ants have shorter legs than their salt pan cousins, the furious stride rate more than compensates, the scientists found. Beyond teasing out the biomechanical secrets of the ants’ incredible speed, the research reveals tricks that engineers can exploit to build smaller, faster, scampering robots, Pfeffer said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/291ad85edcc6202c90247d896308922644bfc3d2/85_0_2722_1633/master/2722.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f6459cf3e1555361c04c07493d870f0","title":"nasa women spacewalk suit sizes space station","story":"Christina Koch and Jessica Meir to make history after delay over suit sizes available at stationNasa is planning the first ever all-female spacewalk as early as Thursday, the space agency has announced.The women’s mission is to replace a faulty battery charging unit on the outside of the station, which failed last weekend, Nasa said.Astronauts and cosmonauts have completed more than 200 spacewalks during the construction and maintenance of the International Space Station, but only 15 women have ever been on a spacewalk, always accompanied by men. There hasn’t been an all-female event in more than a half-century of space walking.The walk was originally scheduled to take place more than six months ago, involving Koch and the Nasa astronaut Anne McClain, but the exercise had to be delayed because Nasa did not have enough of the correctly sized suits available and ready to use on the station. There was only one useable medium-sized suit available in time, and the women needed one each.McClain came back to Earth in June and Nasa has since blasted a second medium spacesuit up to the station, so that the walk – which could take place on Thursday or Friday – could happen.“It turns out that over the next couple of years we’re having a lot of medium-suit people fly, and so that’s the sweet spot,” the program manager for the International Space Station, Kirk Shireman, told a press briefing earlier this month.Separately, the agency has unveiled prototypes of its next-generation spacesuits to be worn inside the Orion spacecraft and on the surface of the moon, because American astronauts are scheduled to return there as early as 2024.One is designed for walking on the moon. The other is a bright orange pressure suit to be worn when astronauts launch from Earth and return.Nasa recently demonstrated that the new suits will allow astronauts to bend, squat and lift their arms above their heads – a facility space suits have restricted until now.“This is the first suit we’ve designed in about 40 years,” Chris Hansen, a manager at Nasa’s spacesuit design office, said. “We want systems that allow our astronauts to be scientists on the surface of the Moon.”Amy Ross, Nasa’s lead spacesuit engineer, said: “Basically, my job is to take a basketball, shape it like a human, keep them alive in a harsh environment and give them the mobility to do their job.”The new lunar suit should also help overcome Nasa’s spacesuit sizing issues: it is a one-size-fits-all garment designed for both men and women.Six people are serving on the space station’s current mission: Koch, Meir, fellow Nasa astronaut Andrew Morgan Russian cosmonauts Aleksandr Skvortsov and Oleg Skripochka and the European Space Agency’s Luca Parmitano."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20219b1fccaef4b16e1c968b7af7e3e59291e6b6/324_0_3453_2072/master/3453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e29b57ef5d597e59714559d79ad19a54","title":"patrick day charles conwell open letter","story":"Boxer Patrick Day has died after he sustained head injuries in a fight on Saturday night against fellow American Charles Conwell.The 27-year-old was knocked out in the 10th round of his super-welterweight bout in Chicago and fell into a coma, with his promoter confirming Day’s death on Wednesday “surrounded by his family, close friends and members of his boxing team”.“He was a son, brother, and good friend to many,” said a statement from Lou DiBella.“Pat’s kindness, positivity, and generosity of spirit made a lasting impression with everyone he met. Patrick Day didn’t need to box. He came from a good family, he was smart, educated, had good values and had other avenues available to him to earn a living.“He chose to box, knowing the inherent risks that every fighter faces when he or she walks into a boxing ring. Boxing is what Pat loved to do. It’s how he inspired people and it was something that made him feel alive.”Day was taken from the ring on a stretcher and underwent emergency brain surgery at Northwestern Memorial Hospital after being knocked out in the final round of his fight on the undercard of Saturday night’s Oleksandr Usyk-Chazz Witherspoon show. The tragedy prompted Conwell to write an open letter to his fallen opponent which he posted Tuesday on Instagram.“This is my last time speaking on the situation because of this being a sensitive topic not only for his family and friends but for myself and the sport of boxing,” Conwell said, before addressing Day directly.“Dear Patrick Day,” Conwell wrote. “I never meant for this to happen to you. All I ever wanted to do was win. If I could take it all back I would. No one deserves for this to happen to them. I replay the fight over and over in my head thinking what if this never happened and why did it happen to you. I can’t stop thinking about it myself. I prayed for you so many times and shedded so many tears because I couldn’t even imagine how my family and friends would feel.“I see you everywhere I go and all I hear is wonderful things about you. I thought about quitting boxing but I know that’s not what you would want. I know that you were a fighter at heart so I decided not to but to fight and win a world title because that’s what you wanted and that’s what I want so I’ll use you as motivation every day and make sure I always leave it all in the ring every time. #ChampPatrickDay. With Compassion, Charles Conwell.”DiBella, who promotes both Conwell and Day, told ESPN on Tuesday night that he was moved to tears by the fighter’s expression.“No one prompted him to write it – not his management and not his promoter,” DiBella said. “I know Charles is profoundly sad right now by what happened. I’m trying to make him realize it’s no fault of his. I read what he wrote and it put a tear in my eye. It was an incredibly human and honest and genuine response from a kid who is just 21. He’s a really good kid, a really good person. I think it was very obvious to both of them that they were both good guys. Charles’ letter was really touching. It screams of honesty and authenticity.”Boxing has been gripped by tragedy this year after the deaths of three fighters as a result from injuries sustained in competition.The Argentinian junior welterweight Hugo Alfredo Santillan died in July, becoming the second fatality in four days after Russia’s Maxim Dadashev succumbed to injuries suffered in Maryland. Bulgarian featherweight Boris Stanchov died in September after injuries suffered during his pro debut in Albania, after which it was discovered he was fighting illegally under his cousin Isus Velichkov’s boxing license."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f8d7ff8ff889ac5e159092c0c7b6306720608f3/0_14_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cd8d081361512097dc2e8494f89c6a9","title":"rugby world cup england team australia","story":"Eddie Jones has sprung a huge surprise by dropping George Ford and naming Owen Farrell at fly-half for England’s World Cup quarter-final against Australia on Saturday.

Courtney Lawes is preferred to George Kruis in the second row while Billy Vunipola also makes his 13th consecutive start for England having recovered from his ankle injury.Jones’s decision to change his fly-half comes as a major shock after he seemed to have settled again on the Ford-Farrell axis.Tuilagi has also shone outside them in the three matches they have started together. Slade has been struggling with a knee problem however, but now back to full fitness Jones has reverted the midfield trio he favoured during the Six Nations. Farrell, Tuilagi and Slade have not lined up together since England’s capitulation to Scotland at the end of the Six Nations, however.

But his form at the tournament – he was named man of the match against the USA – makes Jones’s decision to drop him all the more surprising. Not least when Farrell has been scratching around for form.Jones has also seen fit to select Mako Vunipola from the off despite the fact he has played little more than half an hour of rugby since May. He had been set to start the cancelled match against France last weekend with Joe Marler nursing a back injury. As the better scrummager Marler had been expected to start but Jones has opted to bring Vunipola straight into the fold.“Once you get to the quarter-finals it’s about having the right mindset,” said Jones. “We know how well we can play, it’s about us playing to our strengths and trying to take away from what Australia want. Australia are a clever team, they will have some specific attacking strategies to play against us so we need to have a great situational awareness. We need to defend with brutality and when we have the ball we need play on top of them.”The back three is unchanged from that which started England last match against Argentina while Ben Youngs continues at scrum-half. Jamie George and Kyle Sinckler join Mako Vunipola in the front row while Maro Itoje, Tom Curry and Sam Underhill complete the pack.

Well, try and banish the picture, if that is possible, but consider instead the sound. An unholy conjugation of machine and animal from which Formula One would surely like to keep its distance.This description of the sound of F1 cars is not the aural sculpture the sport wants associated with its expansion in North America. Yet said development, in the form of this week’s announcement of an agreement in principle to host a race in Miami, may yet see the delightfully colourful phrase bandied around for a while longer.Since taking over the sport in 2017 the owners, Liberty Media, have sought to add to the lone USGP in Texas. Their original plan to put on a race in Miami was stymied earlier this year by objections over its impact on business, traffic and residents at the proposed bayfront site in downtown.However, on Tuesday Sean Bratches, F1’s commercial director,and the CEO of the Miami Dolphins, Tom Garfinkel, issued a joint statement covering the new plan to host a race in the Miami Gardens district, near the Dolphins’ Hard Rock stadium.“We are thrilled to announce that Formula One and Hard Rock Stadium have reached an agreement in principle to host the first-ever Formula One Miami Grand Prix at Hard Rock Stadium,” it read. “With an estimated annual impact of more than $400m and 35,000 room nights, the Formula One Miami Grand Prix will be an economic juggernaut for South Florida each and every year.”The project, aimed for the calendar in 2021, has been backed by the Dolphins’ franchise and stadium owner, Steve Ross. He is expected to cover costs, including an estimated $40m to build the circuit and its immediate infrastructure.The layout is set to make use of the car parks and land surrounding the stadium. It is far from the glamour of the bayfront but requires fewer grants of approval from public bodies. It does, however, include a stretch of public road to the south of the stadium on Northwest 199th street. Which is one reason this is not yet a done deal.In September residents appraised of the proposal immediately expressed concern. The Miami Herald reported that homeowners commissioned a report on the impact of the race. The acoustics expert Colby Leider who compiled it warned that the noise would reach over 120 decibels, compared it to a jet plane taking off and – bravo Colby, for your critique of the modern F1 sound – cited the quote, originally made in an article from thedrive, that goats and vacuum cleaners would be getting it on. En masse.Public pressure put paid to F1’s first shot at Miami and it has not gone away. The race still requires the approval of the Miami-Dade County Commission. County Commissioner Barbara Jordan opposes hosting it at the stadium and, having met residents, has not changed her opinion.“It solidified my position as a no, in terms of something this community does not want,” she said. The Herald reports that the Miami Gardens Mayor, Oliver Gilbert, also opposes the race.Members of the community were out on Sunday protesting on 199th street. Leading the activists was the former Miami-Dade Commissioner Betty T Ferguson, who made her point to 7 News Miami. “Even more people will be affected negatively by a race like this than even in the downtown area,” she said. “Because you’re talking about a stadium that is surrounded on all four sides by bedroom communities.” It would, she added, be “environmentally devastating”.Regardless, Garfinkel remains optimistic. “Imagine people coming to this region from around the World in May,” he tweeted. “Multiple passing zones and world-class clubs and amenities. Barcelona, Monaco … Miami … make it happen.”Which raised another potential corollary of making it happen. With 22 races next season, Miami would make 23 in 2021, pushing to the limit teams already loth to add meetings. F1’s sporting director, Ross Brawn, said this week it was looking at reorganising race weekends so teams and drivers can arrive a day later, specifically because of the increase in meetings. Which may work or there may still be some pushback and it would be Barcelona – a race in May and only on a contract until 2020 – that may find itself under threat.Some business leaders, especially in hospitality and tourism, are understandably bullish about the advantages of hosting in Miami with the grand prix being likened to hosting a Super Bowl every year. Which is a comparison no doubt not being made by accident. F1 has already described how it wants its races at “destination cities” to represent Super Bowl-style events.Whether it finally achieves that in Miami lies first in the hands of the county commissioners. Another rejection would be a severe blow for Liberty Media, their juggernaut derailed by the threat of noisy humping."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4289580f42eb8eea2dfcc83d989dc68f09f7608a/0_322_4834_2901/master/4834.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a91685a09016fe43fee9a4f706a6c010 1400w","title":"glitch india biometric welfare system starvation","story":"Claimants are given a 12-digit number linked to their data, and if something goes wrong they can be refused foodMotka Manjhi had been back and forth to the ration shop four or five times, his wife said, but on each occasion he returned empty-handed. His thumbprint, needed to prove his identity, wasn’t registering on the new system.He was told to do an online update. But to do so he would need to get to a private centre – a four-mile journey from his village in Dumka, in the state of Jharkhand, north-east India. This would mean missing at least a day’s potential work, which he desperately needed to buy food. And even if he made the trek, there was no guarantee that the system, which often suffers from network outages, would be working properly. What was to be done?In the past, Manjhi and other low-income Indians only needed papers to pick up subsidised grains to feed themselves. But the welfare system in India has undergone dramatic change.Each person claiming support is now required to have an Aadhaar, a unique 12-digit number that is linked to their biometric and demographic data. The scheme has grown so quickly since its introduction in 2009 that it now covers more than 1.2 billion people and is the world’s largest biometric identification system.The Indian government argued that this system would revolutionise welfare: computerised checks would stop fraudsters from siphoning off other people’s benefits, allowing more money to reach the poor. But campaigners say its design is flawed and it is riddled with technological glitches. They argue it has become a Kafkaesque nightmare that has caused misery for the very people it claims to protect.Despite the serious concerns raised by economists and poverty experts, the system kept on growing and is now involved in access to anything from a pension to medical reimbursements or disaster emergency relief. Activists say in some cases parents are wrongly being asked for an Aadhaar number in order to enrol their children in school.Even if a person is lucky enough to find out what has caused the disruption, this doesn’t mean the problem will be solved. “Officials at district level or lower district level may be able to tell you why your payment has stopped they may not be able to tell you how to fix it,” Khera said.In Majhi’s case, the problem of his unrecognised thumbprint was left unresolved as he couldn’t take the time to make the trek to the centre. Meals were missed – just a few to start, then more and more often – and Manjhi became extremely thin.On 22 May he collapsed outside the family home. Neighbours rushed to help as his wife, Alabati Devi, tried to resuscitate him. An ambulance took him to hospital but it was too late. He died aged 50.No one declared the cause of his death, but the family believe it was starvation. “When he came back from looking for work he said: ‘Give me food or I will die,’” said Devi. There was nothing to give him. Hours later he fainted. All he had eaten that day was a small portion of rice and toddy palm fruit, which grows nearby their home.“He was malnourished because of the lack of the food,” said Devi, who noted he had no other illnesses.The family was living hand to mouth, said Bijay Prasad Kapi, a social activist who has supported Devi and many others. “They didn’t have any food, they couldn’t afford to store any rice. They didn’t know where to get help.” Devi was entitled to a pension but this had not arrived in her account since January.The block development officer for Majhi’s neighborhood was not reachable and the supply officer declined to comment.Activists have tracked 13 cases in Jharkhand where people who were refused support due to aadhaar glitches have allegedly died of starvation. One was an 11-year-old girl. The death of Santoshi Kumari, whose family’s ration card was cancelled because it was not linked to Aadhaar, shocked the country in 2017. Officials denied that Santoshi died of starvation and said her death was due to malaria. Other cases of alleged starvation deaths have also been denied by the government.Campaigners say the system continues to be fraught with problems. Fingerprints don’t scan properly, officials fail to offer timely assistance and internet coverage is too poor for the system to function.Pansure Murmu, who runs a ration shop in Jammu, said Aadhaar worked well on the whole, but she admitted the network signal was a problem. “We have to move the machine one or two kilometres to get the signal,” she said.Others have been known to take their customers to a hilly mound to get a signal for internet access. Residents in Lurgumi Kalan village in Mahuadanr, also in Jharkhand, went without rations for two months this summer because there was no connection, according to researchers at the campaign group Right To Food (RTF).Rice was distributed to the village only after one resident, 64-year-old Ramcharan Munda, died. Munda, who lived with his family in abject poverty in a small mud hut, had not eaten for two and a half days, activists found. Residents and the dealer had reportedly asked the administration on multiple times to revert to an offline system but this did not happen.Government officials issued a notice stating that if fingerprint scans failed, people should not be denied rations. But Ashrafi Nand Prasad, a state coordinator for RTF, said this message had not filtered down in many areas. “The local ration shop owners were not doing that,” he said. Like Manjhi, people were simply turned away with nothing.“Payments were always an issue and they were getting delayed even before Aadhaar, but one could see improvements happening for sure,” said Siraj Dutta, who works on social policy in Jharkhand. “With Aadhaar, everything went crazy and new problems came up.”Shrimati Devi, 70, who lives in Dumka, Jamma, said she had not received her 1,000-rupeesa-month pension for months. She eventually discovered that it was being paid to someone else’s bank account. Government staff told her to speak to the bank and the bank told her to speak to the inidual who was receiving her money.The problem of duplicate or fake cards, which Aadhaar promised to target, was actually “extremely negligible”, said Dutta. Corruption was happening elsewhere: grains were going missing before they reached the ration shop and dealers were fudging their records to suggest they had given plenty to customers, when actually some grains were held back.After Aadhaar was rolled out, the Jharkhand government claimed it had wiped out around 1m fake ration cards. Campaigners say many of those were genuine cards held by people who hadn’t successfully obtained an Aadhaar number and linked this to their card. A survey conducted by RTF found that of a sample of 135 cancelled ration cards, only two were declared fake and three deemed to be duplicates.Some were cancelled for not linking to Aadhaar or because the inidual had died, though the majority, 96, were scrapped without any explanation.Some states have chosen to supplement funds from central government to ensure vulnerable families are not left out Not Jharkhand, however, where some families are turned away or face long delays. Alabati Devi’s family are now getting the right support, although Kapi said they did not officially have the correct ration cards. Things changed after activists raised awareness of Manjhi’s death through the media.She expressed concern about other families in Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha – India’s poorest states. “Where is the dignity in all this? These programmes have been put in place to allow people to live a life of dignity, and you are reducing them to beggars.”Additional reporting by Mohammad Sartaj Alam"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c14a1a81d1a298626101ebd389bf446f5200047/0_0_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46e0f3eb6cdbff1fa9ab26bc47643d60","title":"how do i find a laptop that can be upgraded or repaired","story":"Colin wants a laptop with easily replaceable parts such as memory and hard drivesI just read last week’s answer about upgrading or replacing a six-year-old ThinkPad laptop. I want a laptop where I can easily replace components such as memory and hard drives. How does one go about finding out which modern laptops are modifiable by users? ColinThe one-sentence answer is that consumer laptops often can’t be modified by users, while business laptops can. There are lots of exceptions, but it’s a reasonable rule-of-thumb.It’s not a complete answer, because you also have to know which laptops are aimed at consumers, and which at business users. This is also a somewhat fuzzy area because businesses can use laptops that are really designed for consumers – Dell’s XPS 13 and Apple’s MacBook are examples – while consumers can and do buy business machines.The corollary is something I hear a lot, though it’s more of a complaint than a question: why do the major PC suppliers sell so many different ranges of laptops? They may offer half a dozen or more laptops with similar or even identical specifications under different brand names at different prices, so it’s easy to be confused.Consumers and business buyers have different uses in mind, which means they have different buying criteria. The big PC manufacturers – mainly Dell, HP and Lenovo – therefore create different ranges to meet these different needs.Most consumers want laptops that are uncomplicated and as cheap as possible. Their desires are met by manufacturing laptops with “standard” specifications in very large volumes, sometimes millions of units per year. Most consumers don’t modify their laptops anyway, so it makes sense to solder and glue everything down. This increases reliability, and avoids some of the support calls that destroy the razor-thin profits made on these machines.It also makes them hard to repair, of course, but laptops have become almost as disposable as smartphones and tablets. Some are so cheap it’s simpler to responsibly recycle a broken laptop and buy a new one. Businesses want laptops that are sturdy, reliable and repairable, and they are willing to pay a bit more for them. As a result, business laptops are tested to provide much higher levels of use in much more variable conditions. Some are tested to meet US military specification standards because they will be used by the police and armed forces, and so on. (There are even more rugged machines designed for field service technicians, oil rigs and battlefield use.)Businesses typically need a wider range of configurations, and many of their users need more than the “standard” specification of the day. Often, they also want to be able to buy and support the same laptops for a very long time. Consumer laptops can change every few months, and the specs can vary if someone gets a bargain deal on a particular component. By contrast, businesses buying fleets of perhaps 10,000 or more machines want to be able to buy identical machines over a long period, perhaps 12-18 months, and parts for up to five years. Sometimes their IT departments repair machines by swapping in parts from broken ones, so it helps if the components are effectively the same. Standardisation reduces the cost of ownership.Business laptops sometimes have extra features such as connections for docking stations, they come with Windows 10 Pro instead of Home, and they get better support. Global businesses also want laptops that can be repaired or replaced anywhere in the world.You can, of course, buy a business laptop even if you don’t have a business. In fact, if your pattern of use is similar, it’s the best option. If it’s just for casual use, it’s overkill.Companies that sell a lot of PCs – both HP and Lenovo shift about 40m a year – can afford to support product ranges that target different sets of buyers. It’s really no different from, say, car manufacturers, where the product line can stretch from a Ford Ka+ to a Transit Minibus, with sportier options such as the Mustang and the Ford GT. PC’s can stretch from mini versions to giant server farms (blade computers), with sportier options such as games PCs.So, if you want a laptop that can be repaired and upgraded, you’re more likely to find it in the business ranges. Examples include Dell’s Latitude and Prestige ranges, HP ZBooks, ProBooks and EliteBooks, and Lenovo ThinkPads, which originated with IBM in 1992. However, even business laptops are going with the trend towards thinner and lighter machines that are less flexible and harder to upgrade or repair.If you really want a laptop that is relatively easy to upgrade or repair, buy the most configurable one you can find. That will usually be a ThinkPad or similar business laptop, or a machine from one of the suppliers that builds to order in the UK, such as Chillblast and PC Specialist.Lenovo typically offers some ThinkPads pre-configured to meet popular demand, which can be shipped the next day, and some that let you select exactly the configuration you want. This usually includes four or more choices of processor and storage, and in some cases, the choice of four different screens. It won’t ship the next day, but you will get the spec you want.When it comes to other parts, download the laptop’s repair manual, which is usually available as a pdf file. This will tell you which parts are FRUs (field replaceable units). If an FRU goes wrong, the manufacturer (or a third-party supplier) will ship you the part so that you can change it yourself. Other parts need expert repairers.Installing an FRU can be fiddly, and sometimes needs special tools or new cables or whatever. The next step is therefore to search for a YouTube video where someone shows how they did the upgrade in question. Many of these videos are badly made, but that doesn’t matter. You only need to see which bits need to be unscrewed and how easily they fit back together.The iFixit website is well known for disassembling devices and giving them a score for repairability, which is great if they’ve covered your potential purchase. They mainly teardown high-profile machines, so they probably haven’t. However, iFixit also has thousands of repair guides written by external contributors, and an answers forum where you can ask for advice. The company also sell tools and repair kits, with iFixit Europe shipping to EU countries from its offices in Stuttgart. It’s a business, but it promotes the Right to Repair as good business.Have you got a question?

She talks wage gaps, wardrobe woes and her dreams of becoming a dentistRegina King had a hard time convincing some of her friends about Watchmen, her new HBO series inspired by the DC comic book of the same name and featuring the kind of details that make some people run for the exits: time travel, kung-fu fighting, masks and thinly veiled political allegory. “Girl, don’t do this,” said one friend. King could only smile and agree.But we would all do well to watch King – in anything. At 48, she is in her prime. While filming Watchmen, King won the best supporting actress  Oscar for  If Beale Street Could Talk, based on the James Baldwin novel. For years, she has been turning out quietly devastating portraits – in the movies Jerry Maguire and Ray, in the TV show Southland – with little public recognition. Now she has her pick of roles. “I appreciate winning the Oscar,” she says, “but that’s not the ultimate goal. I should be able to use it as currency moving forward.”King was not familiar with the original Watchmen material, nor the 2009 Zack Snyder movie (her 23-year-old son Ian is more excited about this role than any of King’s previous parts). But once she read the script, she was enthused. In Damon Lindelof’s adaptation, the tale’s 1950s cold-war storyline is spun into a look at the rise of a white supremacist group in a parallel US. King plays Angela Abar, a cop with superhuman fighting skills and an amazing French Lieutenant’s Woman-style cape: not the kind of part she usually gets.King, who in a New York hotel room is slight and smiling, powers through the series like a wrecking ball. She tuned into the fantasy landscape pretty quickly, even quibbling with wardrobe over the practicality of each costume. Originally, her mask was so cumbersome it seemed to defy even the tenuous reality of a comic-book tale. “I was like, ‘This is not good for the superhero peripheral! I can’t see if something’s coming – you have to tell me!’ So our wardrobe designer had a great idea: what if it was painted on?” It was hell on her skin, but it’s dynamite on screen.Lindelof was co-creator of Lost and the recent HBO hit The Leftovers. Watchmen has that same compelling narrative, the story of men with bamboo torches trying to eliminate black people. In the current climate, this parallel America feels very like the real thing. One of Lindelof’s triggers, says King, was Ta-Nehisi Coates’s 2014 article for the Atlantic, The Case for Reparations, addressing the unacknowledged fall-out from slavery. She also cites “the way policing is happening here in the States with, particularly, black men.” To this end, Watchmen is, oddly, of a piece with Beale Street, Baldwin’s exposé of the split-screen reality in the US between white people and people of colour – although Watchmen doesn’t seem expressly political to King. With a laugh, she says: “Being black, it’s part of my life. What’s happened is that Trump has just emboldened people. They were always there, feeling the way they’ve been feeling, but now, oh my gosh. There are a lot of people – white friends I have – who have had this wedge in their families. They knew maybe a family member was a little less progressive, but whoa! Now they’re finding out their views were so far apart.”Meanwhile, the idea of white supremacy as a guerrilla force is not exactly fantastical, given the extent such militias play in US history. “It’s easy to pretend that something didn’t exist if you’re not talking about it,” says King. “Within our community, yes, we’re talking about it all the time, because we’re living it generation to generation. But for a lot of white Americans, ignorance is bliss. For them.”King grew up in California, and wanted to be a dentist. This was not a passing phase. She loved going to her dentist so much, it seemed for many years to be the only possible career path. “I would always hear horror stories about the dentist, but not mine. His dental assistant was his wife, Babe, and she had this white hair that looked like cotton candy. I always looked forward to going. I’d floss to impress him. He made the experience fun. He made me understand how important your periodontal situation is.” She bursts out laughing. “He had a great set of teeth and Babe had a great set of teeth! So whenever I would see people without a great set of teeth I’d be like, ‘Ew!’”Don’t ever live in Britain, I say. “Yeah, I know.” Again she hoots with laughter. “Not a lot of good teeth there.”King had acted in school, but it wasn’t until she got to theUniversity of Southern California that it became clear to her not only that dental work wasn’t in her future, but that what she should do was drop out to act. It amazes her now that she made this decision with “no information to back it up”. She simply knew it was the right thing to do, a strong intuition foreshadowing a steeliness that would become apparent 30 years later in her most famous roles. Her parents weren’t happy. “My mom is a teacher and showed her disappointment,” she says, “but not enough that it made me decide to go back.”She was so young and inexperienced that for years, in roles she took in movies such as Boyz N the Hood and Mighty Joe Young, she had no idea of pay scale, or whether she was receiving a fair income relative to others on set. “I wasn’t focused on that,” she says. “It wasn’t until I was in my 30s that I even stopped to consider the wage gap. It was something as simple as hearing a male actor say something – either about his per diem, or something else – and I was like, ‘Wait! Hold up – my part is way bigger than yours.’” No one talked about it in the early days? “Well, things have been designed so that we don’t.”King has been a supporter of Time’s Up, the campaign to equalise pay and conditions for women in Hollywood. “That’s why this is a pretty exciting time. If I’m blessed enough to have a granddaughter, she’ll come in knowing this is how it’s going to be. I feel like it’s diminishing it by calling it a movement. It’s witnessing a shift, a life change. That’s how I look at it.”Crucially, she says, expectations have changed: there’s a suspicion that, just as sexual harassment will come back to bite you, so will pay differences. “No one wants their filthy past, their dirty little secret, to come out. A lot of people in these positions of power – white men – don’t even realise it was a problem, or something you should feel embarrassed about.”King is glad she had a lot of solid success before she won the Oscar, playing supporting roles in big movies. “I’ve heard people say, ‘Oh, you were robbed with Jerry Maguire, or Ray.’ But I don’t think I would’ve had an appreciation for the art, in the way I do, if it had happened earlier.”Beale Street was a different experience. “Oh, gosh,” says King, who found it so personal that talking about it still makes her emotional. Astonishingly, it was the first movie adaptation of a Baldwin novel, a film that remained a quiet, literary piece despite the starriness of its cast – and of its director, Barry Jenkins, fresh from his Oscar win for Moonlight the previous year. For King, who played Sharon Rivers, the mother of a young woman whose fiance is wrongly imprisoned for rape, it was everything: a love story, an indictment of the criminal justice system, and part of the vast, untold history of black life in the US. “We’re in a time when film is so loud and the audience is looking for shocking. It’s hard to convince people that there is an audience out there that wants quiet stories.”So does she feel in her prime? “For the most part, body-wise, I don’t feel different than when I was in my 20s,” she says. “Only when I hurt something, because it takes so long to get back. But the wisdom and regard for what’s important is different now. In my 20s, that I-don’t-give-a-fuck attitude is great. It helps you go out on a ledge and let your feet dangle down and not even think about it.”Still, it is nothing compared with the thrill of having better judgment: “Being in your 40s and having the wherewithal to know, ‘Yeah, maybe not that ledge.’” She roars with laughter.• Watchmen is on HBO in the US from 20 October and on Sky Atlantic and Now TV in the UK from 21 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae43ec314809088f1a264a41a5ecdcf286380a55/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0de936dc98567794b10787a69a583871","title":"british family deported after saying they accidentally crossed us border","story":"Family of seven were detained for nearly two weeks after crossing into Washington state, saying they were trying to avoid an animal in the roadLawyers for a British family who made an unauthorized crossing from Canada into the United States say the family have been deported after nearly two weeks in federal custody.Bridget Cambria says US Immigration and Customs Enforcement told her all seven members of the family, including an infant and toddler twins, were headed back to England.

Your first port of call for news in that vein should be our live blog which is already up and running. The DUP has already upped the stakes this morning by saying it could not support the deal in its current form but would continue to “work with the government to try and get a sensible deal”. EU leaders have said they are ready to approve the agreement today at the leaders’ summit in Brussels if the prime minister succeeds. Plans to publish a full legal text ahead of the summit were put on hold yesterday because of the unionists’ objections. The prime minister is due to travel to Brussels and, if able to secure a deal, he would try to pass it through parliament on Saturday. He would need to rope in DUP support, along with up to 21 Tory rebels whom he ordered expelled from the party, and may have to resort to any Labour MPs who are prepared to give their backing.‘I will call you later’ – Donald Trump warned his counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdoğan “don’t be a fool” and said history risked branding him a “devil” in an extraordinary letter sent the day Turkey launched its incursion into north-eastern Syria. The bizarre presidential missive opens with “Let’s work out a good deal!” and closes with “I will call you later”. Trump wrote: “You don’t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don’t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy – and I will.”Two-thirds of House Republicans have joined Democrats to support a House resolution condemning Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from territory where Kurdish fighters defeated Isis. The vote triggered what House speaker Nancy Pelosi described as “a meltdown” by the president when she and other members of Congress met with him in the White House. Democrats walked out in response to his tirade.’s climate pledge –  Media Group has announced its commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2030. This goal is part of a newly unveiled environmental pledge to continue our longstanding record of powerful environmental reporting. “We have always led the way in environmental reporting,” writes Katharine Viner, the ’s editor-in-chief, “whether it’s covering air pollution or wildlife extinction, threats to the oceans or the human and social costs that rising temperatures bring. We’ve already begun a full audit of emissions, and once we have the results we will work with the new staff sustainability forum to develop a detailed plan to achieve this goal.” GMG also announces it is the first major international news organisation to become a B Corporation – businesses that use their profits and growth for a greater good and have a positive impact for their employees, communities and the environment. Viner continues: “Through our recently acquired B Corp status, which commits us to reducing our environmental impact as well as to high standards of governance and social impact, we will be transparent and accountable.”‘Make BBC like Netflix’ – Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, has said she is “open-minded” about scrapping the BBC television licence fee and replacing it with a Netflix-style subscription. “The licence fee last year raised £3.7bn for the BBC,” she told MPs’ digital, culture, media and sport committee. “They obviously have other sources of income as well. So I would need to understand what, if you were going to change, that would do to their income.” Her comments will boost the hopes of anti-BBC Tories, and scrapping the licence fee was recently raised by the rightwing Institute for Economic Affairs thinktank. Sources in her department later suggested it would not be a priority for Morgan and pointed out the government has committed to maintain the licence fee funding model for the BBC until 2027.Ants in a hurry – The Saharan silver ant has been clocked by researchers as the fastest ant in the world, blazing through the speed trap at the scaled-down equivalent of 120mph and able to travel 108 times its body length in a second. Running flat out, with their gallops bringing all six legs off the ground at once, the ants can cover 85.5cm per second in 47 strides, more than 10 times Usain Bolt’s stride rate.Unlike other desert creatures which shelter from the intense 60C noon heat, for Cataglyphis bombycina it is a prime time to scavenge.

Professional women’s golf in Europe is set to be afforded a timely boost after talks resumed over the LPGA Tour’s proposed takeover of the Ladies European Tour. Despite a late strike that earned Atlético Madrid a precious away goal, and a draw in the Women’s Champions League, the Manchester City manager, Nick Cushing, remained relaxed. And American golfer Lee Ann Walker was not aware that caddies no longer can stand behind players as they putt unless a player starts the stance over – and she paid a dear price, adding 58 penalty strokes at a Senior LPGA event.Asian stocks have barely moved after soft US retail sales data raised fears about the health of the world’s largest economy, sucking the steam out of a five-session rally.

We asked adoptive parents to share their advice“You don’t have to be a superhero,” says Sue Armstrong Brown, chief executive of the charity Adoption UK, the leading voice of adoptive families.Armstrong Brown believes that many of the characteristics adoptive parents require are the same as those all parents need. “Warmth, openness and a willingness to accept the unknown are key,” she says. “Adopters need to be emotionally mature, have resilience and problem-solving skills and the ability to prioritise family relationships. And a good sense of humour is essential.”Adopted children’s early experiences mean they can often struggle with relationships and day-to-day life. Many have suffered abuse or neglect, all have been separated from their birth families and most have spent time in the care system. They need love, understanding and patience to help them overcome their difficulties and go on to lead confident, happy lives.Although it can be challenging, being an adoptive parent is also hugely rewarding and adopters provide some of the UK’s most vulnerable children with the stable homes they so desperately need.Heather and her husband, Dan, adopted Miles 15 months ago when he was just over a year old. Heather considers empathy to be the most important quality in an adoptive parent. “That is probably the biggest one,” she says. “Really understanding where children are coming from.“I think it’s important being able to admit to them if you don’t get something right,” Heather continues. “Adopted children can mistrust adults even if they don’t know where that comes from. Some have never had an adult meet their basic needs.”Dan and Heather were an “adoption first” couple, meaning that they had not experienced infertility, but went straight for adoption to start their family.“At the time, I was working with children who were in care, and for some of the children their plan was adoption. It didn’t feel right to us as a couple to have a baby when we knew so many children were waiting for families,” says Heather.The fact that she was already working in nurseries and children’s centres meant that there was no mystique for her around adoption. Dan had his reservations at first but once he went to a group for prospective adopters, those feelings disappeared.“He realised they were just children, there was nothing to be frightened of. They just needed a stable, loving home,” Heather says.They also knew they had to work together as a couple, supporting each other, being flexible and communicating about any challenges. “The challenges that adoptive children bring are the same as for all children, but the approach has to be different,” she says. “Miles sometimes struggles with separation so it’s about building up trust.”Tanya Killick is a project worker at Adopteens, an online community for adopted young people aged 11 to 18 living in Yorkshire and the Humber region. She believes adopters with teenagers should be open to exploring their children’s pasts. “It’s about flexibility around the teenagers’ emotional needs,” she says. “An understanding of where they have come from is crucial in helping them form a strong sense of their own identity.”Education poses many challenges to adopted children and their families. While GCSEs, A-levels, and going to college can be stressful for many young people, those who are adopted can find these life stages even more difficult. “They need a lot more support in school,” says Killick. “Adoption is not just a point in time, it is a part of you forever.”Claire is a single adoptive parent from north-east England who has two daughters, now aged five-and-a-half and three. She was in her early 30s when she first thought about adopting. “I felt ready to have kids and wasn’t in a relationship at the time. One of my parents was adopted, so it was something that I grew up with. It just seemed like the right way to do it.”When she began to research adoption, she realised many of the children in the looked-after system had been exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. Claire made the conscious decision to openly accept that and look for sources of support after she had adopted. Both her children have foetal alcohol syndrome and have benefited from specialist therapies. Claire has been able to deal with the resulting challenges as they arise. “It just requires thinking in a different way, a different sort of parenting,” she says.Armstrong Brown reiterates that adoption can be uniquely fulfilling. “Adoptive parents find they have a deep love for their children that really enhances their lives, despite the challenges,” she says.“If you are interested, and feel drawn to adopt, just make an enquiry – it doesn’t commit you to anything.”If you are interested in finding out more about adoption, contact First4Adoption on 0300 222 0022 or visit first4adoption.org.ukyoucanadopt"},{"url":null,"title":"college open","story":"Open days give you a great chance to gauge how good a fit your course and college choice will bePreparation can help you take full advantage of open day opportunities"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Brexit deal latest news: DUP says it \u0026#39cannot support\u0026#39 Boris Johnson\u0026#39s deal as he heads to Brussels to win over European CouncilDuke of Cambridge hits a six in Pakistan cricket match - but the Duchess is caught out twiceClocks change: why do we use GMT - and do we still need to?Commuters drag Extinction Rebellion protester from roof of train as activists target Tube - latest newsPollsters can\u0026#39t agree how far ahead the Conservatives are - and shy Labour voters could be to blame Audio Briefings: Sign up to our WhatsApp group for essential twice-daily updatesThe DUP says it cannot support Boris Johnson\u0026#39s deal on customs and consent - what does it mean? Halloween 2019: How Celtic trick-or-treating and Gaelic turnip-carving led to the American celebrationValerie Lundeen Ely, married to Tarzan actor Ron Ely, stabbed to death by sonFrance in last-minute push to force Boris Johnson to give EU fishing boats access to British waters Thursday morning news briefing: Three days to move a mountainComment: Beset by political dysfunction and chronic economic crisis, the EU is too dangerous to remain inside\u0026#39Don\u0026#39t be a fool!\u0026#39 Donald Trump\u0026#39s letter \u0026#39rejected\u0026#39 by Turkish president England\u0026#39s oldest surviving timber trestle bridge and a military complex built during the Napoleonic Wars among heritage sites now at riskMental health hospital to hand out free e-cigarettes to those trying to quit smokingBrexit deal latest news: Donald Tusk says deal is ready, but there are \u0026#39certain doubts on the British side\u0026#39 UCL to ban crisp packets and petri dishes in crackdown on single-use plasticCatalan leader appeals for calm as protesters clash with police and set fires in BarcelonaWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/17/method-composite.jpg","title":"actors method roles crazy joker joaquin phoenix charlize theron list","story":"Subscribe nowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.For some actors, dedication to their craft knows no bounds.There has been a long history of performers who have got so stuck into their roles that they’ve taken things too far, whether they’ve injured themselves or frightened their co-stars on set.While method acting is considered a technique adopted by the greatest actors, there have been many examples of such instances where reining it in could have been beneficial.It won\u0027t be much of a surprise to see certain names here – Daniel Day-Lewis and Joaquin Phoenix are indeed included – but others (Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher, for example) may make you look twiceBelow is a compilation of 21 actors who took certain roles\u0026nbspso seriously things\u0026nbspgot out of hand.Created with Sketch.21 actors who took their roles so seriously it got out of hand Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nicolas Cage has a history of taking his roles too far, but the peak arrived with the Ghost Rider sequel, Spirit of Vengeance (2011).

Our research shows that households will be worse off by £810 annually in the case of a no-deal Brexit, even including the government’s planned no deal tariff schedule.”\u0026nbspHe added: “As retailers have been trying to weather the Brexit storm, they haven’t been able to make structural changes that are needed for long-term survival on an ever-more competitive high street.”RBS boosts Brexit contingency fund by a third\u0026nbspRBS has increased a support fund for small businesses by more than a third to help them deal with Brexit disruption.\u0026nbspThe bank -\u0026nbspwhich has a less-than-stellar reputation with Britain\u0027s SME\u0027s after it was found to have pushed many to the wall and sold off their assets to repair its own balance sheet -\u0026nbsphas added an extra £2.2bn to the fund, taking it to £8.2bn\u0026nbspThe state-backed lender said it had already committed £5.6bn\u0026nbspof the fund.Paul Thwaite, commercial banking managing director at RBS subsidiary NatWest, said: “We are very much open for business and want to be the bank that supports the UK’s businesses through this uncertain time.”UK retail sales flat\u0026nbspin September\u0026nbspUK retail sales were flat in September compared with August, a slightly better performance than a 0.2 per cent dip forecast by economists. Compared with a year earlier, sales rose 3.1 per cent.\u0026nbspOn the three-month measure, which strips out some of the typical volatility in the figures, sales inched up by 0.6 percent from the April-June quarter. \u0026nbspBREAKING:\u0026nbspA senior EU official has said there will be no Brexit negotiations with Boris Johnson at the two-day leaders’ summit beginning today in Brussels, according to Reuters.\u0026nbspThe bloc has not yet received the text of an agreement, the official said.Asda cuts fuel prices\u0026nbspAsda is cutting petrol and diesel prices by 2p and 3 p respectively.\u0026nbspMotorists will pay no more than 121.7p per litre for petrol and 125.7p per litre for diesel, Asda said.\u0026nbspThe RAC said other fuel retailers were failing to pass on falling wholesale prices to drivers.\u0026nbspSimon Williams,\u0026nbspfuel spokesperson\u0026nbspfor the RAC, said: Drivers are losing out badly, paying around 7p a litre more for petrol than they should be.\u0026nbspThis means a driver filling up a 55-litre family car is paying £3.85 too much.\u0026nbspFor some reason, in the last year or so our biggest retailers haven\u0027t been as transparent with their pricing as they have been in the past, which means motorists all over the country lose out as a result of them taking more margin than they have previously.WHSmith snaps up US retailer\u0026nbspWHSmith has continued its march into the US by snapping up North American retailer Marshall Retail for $400m (£3122m).\u0026nbspBosses said they had first started watching the business around four years ago when they made an active decision to pursue the 3.2 billion dollar US travel market.\u0026nbspThe previous owners of Marshall launched a sales process over the summer as WHSmith came out on top.It means the retailer now has a further 170 stores in North America, including 59 in airports, with the remaining in busy tourist hotspots including Las Vegas.\u0026nbspIncoming chief executive Carl Cowling, who starts the new job in November, said: We\u0027ve known the business for about four years. We\u0027ve been watching the market for years trying to think of the best ways to break in.\u0026nbspThe deal comes a year after WHSmith bought travel accessories business InMotion for £155m.\u0026nbspPress AssociationDomino\u0027s UK to quit four overseas markets amid falling sales\u0026nbspThe British arm of Domino\u0027s is to exit Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland because of declining sales.\u0026nbspWe have concluded that, whilst they represent attractive markets, we are not the best owners of these businesses. The board has therefore decided to exit the markets in an orderly manner, said outgoing chief executive David Wild.\u0026nbspIn the UK, Domino\u0027s is in the midst of a long-running battle with store operators who are angry at the declining share of profits they take.\u0026nbspMr Wild said: Normal working practices continue to be impacted by our franchisee dispute.\u0026nbspAs we said at our interim results, this situation is complex and we expect a resolution to take time, certainly into 2020. We remain committed to working with our franchisees to agree sustainable win-win solutions.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWelcome to The Independent\u0027s live coverage of business and economics events.\u0026nbspWHSmith has agreed to buy US retailer Marshall for $400m, Asda has cut fuel prices and the pound is down against the dollar after the DUP\u0026nbspsaid it could not support Boris Johnson\u0027s Brexit deal as it stands.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Net revenue at Goldman’s investing and lending ision slumped 40 per cent as it swallowed a loss of about $80m (£63m) on its stake in WeWork owner The We Company, along with hits from investments in Uber and two other companies.The valuation of WeWork, an office-sharing startup, has plummeted from a peak of $47bn in January to as low as $10-12bn, forcing it to pull its IPO. Meanwhile, Uber’s shares are down 24 per cent since the company went public earlier this year.The only bright spot for Goldman was its institutional client services business, which accounts for more than a third of its overall revenue, but 6 per cent growth at the unit was not enough to offset weakness in other major businesses.“Overall, GS posted mixed results this quarter,” analysts at Keefe, Bruyette \u0026amp Woods said in a note to clients.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A fireman extinguishes a fire near Beirut.

It is moving away from its focus on trading to building a bigger consumer business in a bid to shield its revenue from wild swings in financial markets. Mr Solomon has been in charge since October 2018 and is known for his hobby of spinning records at nightclubs under the handle DJ D-Sol.Goldman, which recently launched a credit card with Apple, has also attempted to build out new businesses, but top executives at the bank have warned in previous quarters that those efforts will take time to bear fruit.At the same time, Mr Solomon is conducting a full-scale review of the business that has led to a culling of its partnership pool of top executives.The bank’s earnings per share fell to $4.79 in the quarter ended on 30 September from $6.28 a year earlier.Total net revenue fell 6 per cent to $8.32bn.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, having identified the root causes of our operational issues, we have made substantial progress over the last few months in resolving them. Whilst there remains lots of work to be done to get the business back on track, we are now in a more positive position to start the new financial year.Asda workers opposed to new contract will hand in petition(Press Association) Asda workers will hand in a 23,000 strong petition to the company on Wednesday opposing a controversial new contract.The signatures will be delivered to Asda\u0027s head office in Leeds in a shopping trolley as part of a campaign by the GMB union.The union says Asda workers have been told to sign new contracts, called contract six, which it claims will see them lose paid breaks and forced to work bank holidays, or be sacked next month.Gary Carter, GMB national officer said: Tens of thousands of members of the public are backing our Asda workers in their fight against these draconian contracts.Contract six is shocking, the changes are forcing our members to choose between looking after their families, or being able to support them. It\u0027s a disgrace.Today we are back in the birth place or Asda, once a proud, family company, calling on bosses to respect workers and offer them a better deal.Despite being blacklisted by Donald Trump\u0027s administration, Huawei has reported sales up 24.4 per cent in the third quarter compared to a year earlier.\u0026nbspThe Chinese tech giant sold 26 per cent more smartphones according to state-backed newspaper the Global Times.\u0026nbspHuawei, the world\u0027s second-biggest smartphone maker, has previously\u0026nbspsaid US trade restrictions could dent revenues by $10bn this year.Turkish bank charged with evading US sanctions on Iran\u0026nbsp(Associated Press) A major Turkish bank has been criminally charged with participating in a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade US sanctions against Iran.\u0026nbspThe charges against Halkbank, a state-owned bank, were announced years after a wealthy gold trader was arrested in Florida.

This growth is despite the turbulent times and uncertain future. It appears that consumers are starting to stockpile in anticipation of a no-deal Brexit,” said Duncan Brewer, retail expert at Oliver Wyman.\u0026nbsp“We expect consumers to tighten their purse strings in the coming months. Our research shows that households will be worse off by £810 annually in the case of a no-deal Brexit, even including the government’s planned no deal tariff schedule.”\u0026nbspHe added: “As retailers have been trying to weather the Brexit storm, they haven’t been able to make structural changes that are needed for long-term survival on an ever-more competitive high street.”RBS boosts Brexit contingency fund by a third\u0026nbspRBS has increased a support fund for small businesses by more than a third to help them deal with Brexit disruption.\u0026nbspThe bank -\u0026nbspwhich has a less-than-stellar reputation with Britain\u0027s SME\u0027s after it was found to have pushed many to the wall and sold off their assets to repair its own balance sheet -\u0026nbsphas added an extra £2.2bn to the fund, taking it to £8.2bn\u0026nbspThe state-backed lender said it had already committed £5.6bn\u0026nbspof the fund.Paul Thwaite, commercial banking managing director at RBS subsidiary NatWest, said: “We are very much open for business and want to be the bank that supports the UK’s businesses through this uncertain time.”UK retail sales flat\u0026nbspin September\u0026nbspUK retail sales were flat in September compared with August, a slightly better performance than a 0.2 per cent dip forecast by economists.

Meanwhile, Uber’s shares are down 24 per cent since the company went public earlier this year.The only bright spot for Goldman was its institutional client services business, which accounts for more than a third of its overall revenue, but 6 per cent growth at the unit was not enough to offset weakness in other major businesses.“Overall, GS posted mixed results this quarter,” analysts at Keefe, Bruyette \u0026amp Woods said in a note to clients.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A fireman extinguishes a fire near Beirut.

It is moving away from its focus on trading to building a bigger consumer business in a bid to shield its revenue from wild swings in financial markets. Mr Solomon has been in charge since October 2018 and is known for his hobby of spinning records at nightclubs under the handle DJ D-Sol.Goldman, which recently launched a credit card with Apple, has also attempted to build out new businesses, but top executives at the bank have warned in previous quarters that those efforts will take time to bear fruit.At the same time, Mr Solomon is conducting a full-scale review of the business that has led to a culling of its partnership pool of top executives.The bank’s earnings per share fell to $4.79 in the quarter ended on 30 September from $6.28 a year earlier.Total net revenue fell 6 per cent to $8.32bn.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It will also be worn by the first ever woman to walk on the Moon, who will head there as part of the Artemis mission.Nasa unveiled two prototypes, one white model designed for exploring outside of the spacecraft on spacewalks, and a second orange suit for high-risk activity on the inside, such as launch and returning to Earth.Amy Ross, a spacesuit engineer, said the new Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) for outside use has been made more flexible than before, making it easier for astronauts to move and bend.It is so flexible that it allows users to put their arms overhead, something astronauts during the Apollo programme were not able to do.\u0026nbspZippers are bad and cables are bad so we have no zippers or cables on this suit, she explained at a demonstration held in Washington DC.There will be fewer seams and new materials that keep the dust out.We found evidence of life on Mars in the 1970s, former Nasa scientistIt also features new technology to better manage pressure and the gloves have been improved to allow greater dexterity.You\u0027ll remember, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, they bunny hopped on the surface of the moon, well now we\u0027re actually going to be able to walk on the surface of the moon, which is very different than our suits of the past, said Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine.The Orion suit used for launch and entry is made from fire resistant material and features a lighter and stronger helmet, with improvements to reduce noise.Nasa is aiming to put the the first woman and next man on the moon by 2024 and maintain a presence with an ISS-like gateway orbiting around it, in hopes of eventually moving further into space to Mars.Kenneth Bowersox, acting associate administrator for human exploration, recently cast some doubt on the target date for the Artemis missions to the moon, saying he would not bet anything on it.Funding and technical challenges still need to come together in order to meet the White House-set deadline, the former space shuttle and space station commander told a congressional subcommittee last month.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When the opportunity arises I would buy new trains on more favourable terms, but we will inherit a leasing arrangement that will be sustained for some time to come, and I have never said anything other than that.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

The cost of purchasing rolling stock is a fraction of the £196 billion and was included as that is what full-scale renationalisation of the rail industry would likely involve. If a Labour government chose not to purchase the rolling stock, they would still need to pay the cost of leasing them.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It had yellowish brown fur, powerful jaws and a pouch for its young like a kangaroo.Among eight sightings in the past three years was one from a couple from Western Australia visiting the island of Tasmania in February, who said they saw one of the creatures crossing the road.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

The Syrian government is hostile to foreign\u0026nbspNGOs\u0026nbspand many remain at risk of arrest.International aid and medical agencies, including Medicines Sans Frontieres, Save the Children, Mercy Corps and DanChurchAid, all released statements saying their intentional staff had\u0026nbspto leave Syria, either partially or fully halting their activities there.The UN said this has disrupted the “supply change” of aid to much of northern Syria, which before the latest conflict was already home to nearly a million displaced people who depended on aid to survive.“Due to changes on the ground and insecurity some NGO partners have had to transfer international staff who were operating in the northeast out of the area, and others have had to temporarily suspend operations,” Hedinn Halldorsson from the agency in Damascus, told The Independent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A slew of countries including the UK has also imposed arms embargoes on Ankara, to little effect.\u0026nbspBut despite the mounting pressure, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan remained defiant, saying earlier: “We will never declare a ceasefire.”Back in Syria, meanwhile,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspa rebel spokesman confirmed that the “operation is ongoing in\u0026nbspRas\u0026nbspal-Ain.” From the Turkish side of the border, ambulances could be seen in war-ravaged town racing away from the front,\u0026nbsptowards hospitals.A briefing paper released by the Turkish government said the town centre of\u0026nbspRas\u0026nbspal-Ain\u0026nbsphad been “cleared out of terrorists” along with 1,217 sq km of territory.Aid workers in Syria said international staff having to evacuate the country because of regime presence,\u0026nbspwould only see the humanitarian crisis worsen.\u0026nbspThe Kurdish Red Crescent (KRC)\u0026nbspcalled the sudden withdrawal\u0026nbspa “disaster” saying the KRC’s 1,000 or so staffers and volunteers were unable to shoulder the burden alone.“Coordination has almost collapsed since the international staffers had to leave. The burden was on them to secure cross border aid. We were also dependent on our partners to get funds, we need international doctors to support us,” the KRC’s Dr Sherwan Berry said.Turkey ‘effectively holding 50 US nuclear bombs hostage’ at air baseRussian soldiers filmed apparently moving into US Syria baseNine suspected Isis members escape from camp in Syria, says FranceMilitary veterans Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Buttigieg clash over SyriaHow Russia is filling the gap left by Trump’s withdrawal of US troops “We have such a load on our shoulders. We don’t have enough staff to man the hospitals, we lost a lot of clinics to shelling and bombing, we have 300,000 displaced people needing food, shelter, water and medical care. We are struggling to provide for them,” he added.He said that KRC ambulances had been targeted by Turkish strikes and several hospitals taken out of service because of the fighting.“Tens of thousands of internally displaced civilians are sleeping on the ground, lacking food, medicine and water,” he added.A senior foreign humanitarian professional, who asked not to be named for security reasons, said should the regime retain control of northeast Syria and the border\u0026nbspit would be “catastrophic” as they would not be able to return.\u0026nbsp“International aid agencies have been supporting hospitals in all the major towns and cities, they have been doing water tucking, bread distribution, rehabilitating schools, water stations and irrigations canals.

It wasn’t so long ago the EU ruled out EVER re-opening the negotiations and Britain was hurtling towards a No Deal crash. What made the dference  Could it be that our friends in Brussels were riled at the idea of Boris fighting an election while blaming them for Britain not getting out on time Things started to change on Tuesday when a No source briefed details of a call between the PM and Germany’s Angela Merkel. The insider’s memo said their conversation made it clear a deal was “overwhelmingly unlikely”.Bearing all the hallmarks of Boris Johnson’s de facto chief of staff Dominic Cummings, it was texted to James Forsyth, Sun columnist and Political Editor of The Spectator. In chilling tones, it raised fears Boris was heading flat out for No Deal.It threatened: “Supporting delay will be seen by this Government as hostile interference in domestic politics. Any delay will be negotiated between you, Parliament and the courts. We will focus on winning the election on a manesto of immediately revoking the entire EU legal order without further talks, and then we will leave.”Feathers were ruffled across the Channel — yet within two days Boris and Irish Taoiseach Varadkar agreed to meet then said they could “see a pathway” to Brexit deal. EU Council President Donald Tusk had earlier made clear his anger at the original briefing, tweeting at the PM: “What’s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.”Outrage aside, Tusk is a seasoned politician and is wise enough to know a general election is coming. Evenhe asked for a humiliating extension, Boris could come back with a majority and a strengthened mandate to take the country to No Dealnecessary.It would have given the EU a reason to pause. Did they really want to take such a big risk and damage relations with the UK, especiallyBoris was going towith No Deal in his manesto  Boris has blustered his way through the critics, promising to “get Brexit done” despite the odds ening every day.At times it has all looked a bit desperate. But the UK doesn’t hold all the cards. To get a deal through, Boris needs the Irish government to compromise too. Varadkar’s stubbornness was a sticking point. Ireland’s leader, like everyone , knows Theresa May’s deal was not supported in Parliament.Showing no signs of movement on the issue would make the Irish just as culpable of creating a hard border as those in Westminster. This hardline briefing is not how any of us want to deal with our friends and allies in Europe. But the brinkmanship looks like it has produced results.We are not out of the woods by any means. At this moment, we are still not clear on any details of the new proposals. So you can see why No kept up the pressure on No Deal, why Chancellor Sajid Javid committed to spending more than £billion to get the Government ready to go and why Michael Gove is working on plans to put all that spending in place.For all the worry about No Deal, keeping it on the table was a necessary step to strengthen our position. Claims the Government was looking for a legal loophole to remove the obstacles now appear fancul.But the EU would have taken note and would have worried about stubbornly sticking to its positionthe threat of No Deal suddenly reappeared. If we are serious about a deal, No should end the hardline rhetoric. The EU will not make this easy. And why should they  But their cautious welcome of the breakthrough with Ireland means we have reasons to be cheerful.Now is the time for cool heads and for Boris to engage in a statesmanlike way. He needs to get to grips with the detail of exactly how we can make an alternative to the backstop work. Sadly, that’s not even the hard part.Any deal will need to come back to Parliament, where tribal loyalties, political positioning and genuine anger have intensied in recent months. There is almost no chance opposition parties will back anything that comes back from Brussels.So the only way to deliver Brexit is to bring together the fractious parts of the Conservative Party, the breakaway Tory rebel MPs and the hardcore Brexit “Spartans”.There is hope this can be done. The rebels will want to avoid a No Deal exit, which any deal would prevent, and the Spartans have started to see that leaving in an orderly way may be the only chance they have to get us out.The alternative could be more months of delay, ending in a second referendum. None of which they could possibly want. And there is one other group to win over, the dangerously dficult DUP.They are critical to parliamentary success. So far, they have stayed tight-lipped about the latest developments, only reiterating their original position of leaving with the rest of the UK.He needs to get Brexit done so he can start repairing the damage getting us here has created. There are  hours until the next EU meeting, when the fate of the country will be decided. Let’s make them count. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The first is Brexit. The second is the ending of this rotten parliament. Neither can come soon enough.Expect hopeless puppet Jeremy Corbyn and those pulling his strings to try to block both.IT seems that “sorry” is not the hardest word, after all, for Anne Sacoolas.With the news that she no longer has diplomatic immunity over the car crash which killed Brit Harry Dunn, , in August, the US intelligence officer’s we broke her silence yesterday.Mrs Sacoolas’s lawyers said she wanted to meet Harry’s family “to express her deepest sympathy and apologies”.Understandably, Harry’s parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn were less than impressed as they flew to America yesterday in search of justice, and Charlotte said: “As it’s nearly seven weeks now since we lost our boy, sorry just doesn’t cut it.”If the “devastated” Mrs Sacoolas truly does appreciate the pain Harry’s loss has caused, she will hopefully admit she was wrong to flee England,and let police continue their investigations.In the meantime, we hope a meeting with Harry’s parents will help them on the way towards some sort of closure.It’s the very least they deserve.IT will be another momentous week in British politics this week and yet it has all gone quiet on Brexit.Could it be that EU officials are too busy with their UK counterparts, working out the details of a deal its negotiators and their collaborators in our parliament said could not be done Let us hope that silence is golden.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But, perversely, it may have also cost them the game.There are not yet specic punishments in place for breaking the racism protocol but Uefa’s Disciplinary Regulations  state: “If a match cannot take place or cannot be played in full, the member association or club responsible forfeits the match.”So it could have been perceived as a home win for racism and defeat for England.Uefa’s woefully inadequate response to a litany of previous racist incidents meant it was left up to Tyrone to make a call.Cool-headed England manager Gareth Southgate later said all his players wanted to carry on.If Uefa bosses had spines, they should have abandoned the game and given the points to England.Players should be able to walk out on a game where mass racism is taking place without risk of forfeiting the match. If nations such as Bulgaria can’t police and steward racist fans, then Uefa should force them to play behind closed doors or exclude them from tournaments until they can.In the build-up to the game, the Bulgarians pointed out the English could hardly occupy the moral high ground.There have been a number of reports of players being racially abused at games here this year and stars are regularly subjected to racism on social media.I have reported on England games for The Sun for the past  years and the dedicated fans are a friendly and welcoming bunch.Most use the opportunity of foreign games for sight-seeing and immersing themselves in local culture.Yet a “stag do” following of younger yobbish fans attaches themselves to Three Lions away games in party destinations such as Amsterdam, Porto and Prague.Booze and drugs are swilled down and continental squares echo to the sound of Ten German Bombers and splintering glass.A minority of fans it may be, but they are still intimidating to locals and families. We have our own house to get in order, too.After the final whistle Tyrone stated that he believed England’s collective decision to stay on was the correct one, saying he was “proud of how we dealt with it”.Dignied in stark contrast to the far-Right nasties who had hounded him.His cry of “Hey, did you hear that ” must surely now be acted upon in football’s corridors of power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

However, it’s a quick out, not something that will include walk-throughs, etc everything is aboutout with as much as possible of our things while destroying any sensitive equipment that cannot be moved.”Trump’s decision to pull out of Syria and effectively hand over control of the north of the country to Assad and Russia has been widely criticised on both sides of the US political aisle.This week, the US President tweeted: “Anyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China or Napoleon Bonaparte.“I hope they all do great, we are , miles away!”On Sunday, Assads Russian-backed Syrian government forces swept into Kurdish-administered areas to shield them against Turkey.Despite the Syrian and Russian deployments, Turkey insists it would capture Manbij - setting up the potential for a bloody battle to come.Asked on Sky NewsTurkeys military was willing to fight Assads army, Vice President Fuat Oktay said, We hope its not going to happen.But again we are determined to get control over Manbij.Mortar fire from Manbij killed two Turkish soldiers and wounded seven others on Tuesday, the Turkish Defense Ministry said.Later, a battalion of around  Turkish troops along with armoured vehicles crossed near Manbij and Kobani.Kobani, a border town, is not yet secured by Syrian forces - and could act as a stronghold from which Turkey plans to attack.Farther east on the border, Turkish and Kurdish forces were in heavy battles over the town of Ras al-Ayn, captured by Turkey days earlier.US troops had outposts in Manbij since  - when they went in to avert a battle over the town between Turkish and Kurdish fighters.Now Russia has taken on that role - with Moscows troops patrolling front lines between Turkish and Syrian army positions.Alexander Lavrentyev, Moscows envoy for Syria, said on Tuesday that no one is interested in fighting between Syrian and Turkish forces.He told Russian state news agencies that Moscow is not going to allow it.In the first week of the Turkish assault, at least  fighters from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have been killed.There were another  fighters from Turkish-backed Syrian factions killed, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.It added at least  civilians have been killed in Syria.A US official said the approximately , US troops being withdrawn from northern Syria will reposition in Iraq, Kuwait and possibly Jordan. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Six months later, we continued our treatment. It was tough. I suffered miscarriages and an ectopic pregnancy which needed emergency ­surgery.“One cycle alone cost us £, and there’s no way we could have afforded it without our Lottery win.  Darcey and Lexi were the best investment we ever made.”AFTER hitting the Lotto jackpot in June , Lesley Blackman renovated an old watermill.  Lesley, , now lives in her dream property on a -acre estate in Clton upon Teme, Worcs, with her -year-old fiancé Matt McCarthy.She said: “The one thing I don’t need to buy with my ­winnings is a hedge strimmer.  I don’t need it, because I’ve the perfect answer to keeping the bank beside our old mill clear of wild brambles.“That’s the job of our three pygmy goats – Milo and his best friends Freddie and Rose. We had always dreamed of having animals, and the Lottery allowed us to move from a two-bedroom cottage in Hertfordshire into the home of our dreams – which is called, appropriately, Hope Mill.“The goats aren’t alone, because we also have Ella the horse, three dogs, two cats, three sheep and a dozen ­chickens. The latest addition is a lone duck. Together, they all make me so happy.”LUCKY trucker Les Scadding was £ overdrawn when he won half of a £million Euromillions jackpot in .

There would be a big awareness campaign, posters in schools and a fortune spent on preventing those deaths.But that is the figure for the number of school-aged children who die from suicide each year.In  there were . That’s more than four a week. It’s absolutely horrying.This week The Health Foundation charity spoke out to demand schools focus more on teaching kids to be happy rather than just passing exams.There should be a greater focus on the arts, it insisted, because too big a focus on academic success is harming children’s mental health.Schools need to do all they can to tackle mental health problems, and giving pupils the chance to take part in art, drama and music is one way that could really help.Many headteachers are far too focused on academic ­success but actually one of their most important jobs is to build young people into the adults they will become.I know first-hand how important the arts are. My brother, Sam, died by suicide on January , . I was in my bedroom when I heard my mum’s scream.I ran in and went into autopilot, using my first aid ­training to try to resuscitate Sam. Tragically, he couldn’t be saved.He had been diagnosed with clinical depression in September  but told very few people as he felt he would be treated ­dferently and would be laughed at.Sam was hugely interested in art and music, and I know he found a lot of comfort from them. It’s about expressing your emotions in a dferent way.Too often, schools are “exam factories”, and the stress that goes with achieving academic success can be tough.If you have somewhere to paint or draw, or pick up an instrument and do something enjoyable without any pressure, it can hugely benefit a person’s wellbeing. It’s a form of therapy.I do appreciate that these subjects may be the first to be cut when school budgets are tight. After all, they are not core subjects. But it’s vital that we look at education as more than just maths, science and English GCSEs.Just this week, Andrew Lloyd Webber said cutting school arts and music budgets is “the stupidest thing that could have ever happened”.He talked about a struggling school in North London which has been transformed, simply by giving each pupil a violin and music lessons.It has gone from being in special measures to having its first pupil land a scholarship to Oxford.I’m not at all surprised by this. The real benefit, though, is allowing pupils to find a ­passion and something they enjoy, just for the sake of it.School can play a large part in a person’s mental health.It is where children spend most of their time and where they develop into adulthood.But following my brother’s death, I was shocked to learn that teachers are not given any mandatory instruction during their teacher training on how to spot and tackle mental health problems.So I started a petition, and that has now reached nearly , signatures.Thanks to The Sun, I was introduced to Boris Johnson at the paper’s Who Cares Wins health awards, then last week, on World Mental Health Day, the Prime Minister personally received my petition in ­Downing Street.The PM wants to see a change in how we approach mental health. No one is born stigmatising people on the grounds of race or gender or because they have dficulties with their mental health.If we can learn to stigmatise, then we can learn to be accepting. We can give children the tools to be able to talk about their mental health, right from a young age, and that will equip them for the rest of their lives.As well as providing a happy environment, teachers should be taught how to spot when someone is struggling and ­dferentiate from what is ­normal, such as exam nerves.Then they need to know how to approach that pupil and where to direct them to get help.Teachers have a hugely dficult job. They are underpaid and overworked.But they have a duty of care, and most teachers I have ­spoken to have been hugely supportive of this idea as one measure in the fight against mental health problems. Mental health awareness training has also been found to improve the wellbeing of staff, as well as students.This is important because looking after the health of our teachers is vital.A friend told me that when the pupils at Sam’s school were told about his death, it was like a bomb going off.Multiply that by all the number of ­people affected by suicide in the UK and you are looking at a problem of epic proportions.But just like putting our seatbelts on, there are ­measures we can adopt to reduce the damage. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Insects including ticks may also be responsible.The virus can survive after the animal has died, it can live on in processed meat for up to a few months and in frozen meat for up several years.Currently the disease cannot be passed onto humans, although there are concerns about future mutations potentially affecting mankind.It struck China too, where  stonepigs were being bred to combat demand shortages for the meat.China alone consumes half of the worlds pork supplies.The disease, which cannot currently be passed onto humans, spreads between pigs and wild boars.There is currently no vaccine and no cure, so experts warn that preventing an outbreak is of paramount importance.Infected pigs initially go off their food, before not wanting to move and then have fever-like symptoms, one experts says.They then bleed throughout the body and inside their organs.Up to  per cent of pigs with the virus die by the end of their second week with the infection.The virus can live on in meat or cold cuts for weeks and when frozen it can survive up to several years, thereport.Animal feed or feed additives can also carry the infection.He said: “If it was me, I would ban the importation of soy products from African-swine-fever-infected states.”Experts believe farmers who use organic soy feeds for their pigs or hogs could particularly be at risk.Generally they fear the increased dangersthe disease continues to spread.But take a look at what this virus is doing around the globe today.

Her pal was seriously injured.Mrs Foster, a graduate of Enniskillen Collegiate Grammar School and Queens University Belfast, has three children with husband Brian.Theresa May seemed on the brink of agreeing a deal with Brussels on the first stage of Brexit negotiations, allowing talks to move to trade and the future relationship.One sticking point was the frontier between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland post-Brexit, with all sides keen to avoid theof a hard border.A leaked draft appeared to show the UK had vowed to ensure continued regulatory alignment with the EU so as not to undermine the Good Friday Agreement.The Dublin government claimed it as a victory, while Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh leader Carwyn Jones said it meant other parts of the UK could stay in the single market.While Mrs May was meeting EU Commission chief Jean Claude-Juncker, the DUP made a statement that kiboshed what had seemed a done deal.Mrs Foster said Northern Ireland must leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the UK and she would not accept anything .The DUP had threatened to pull out of the confidence and supply dealTheresa May caved into demands from Ireland and the EU.Mrs Foster has previously accused the Irish government of hijacking Brexit negotiations to promote a united Ireland.On  November, as Theresa May prepared to address her Cabinet with her agreed Brexit deal, Mrs Foster warned she wont accept a Brexit deal that treats Northern Ireland dferently to the rest of the UK.She rejected suggestions Northern Ireland could remain in the single market and customs union in a special arrangment to keep the border open.Ireland’s PM, Leo Varadkar, warned he would veto any progress in Brexit talks unless the UK came up with proposals to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"Soyoure after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further. to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun  - Receive the  biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-le stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TVShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.now! px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" And dont forget to check out the all-new Sun Mobile app - with an amazing facelt, the new app allows you to follow your favourite topics and build your very own homepage.Updated round the clock, its packed full of pictures, videos, and breaking news and showbiz exclusives you really cant find anywhere .  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Prime Minister is proposing that from  Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic share the same EU single market rules. This removes the need for checks on livestock and some goods at the Irish border. But this would require a border in the Irish Sea to monitor food and animal products entering Northern Ireland from mainland Britain. And officials on both sides of the English Channel said on Wednesday morning numerous obstacles still needed to be surmounted for a fresh agreement to be brokered. The PM updated his cabinet members about the progress of the deal before EU chief negotiator Michelle Barnier briefed ambassadors at pm. Mr Johnson laid out his proposals to the  Committee, who are likely to be crucial in determining whether the bill passes through Parliment.    Why is it so controversial  The talks hit two major stumbling blocks: customs and consent. The DUP has previously objected to a border in the Irish Sea as it fears it could lead to Northern Ireland’s annexation from the UK. There is an issue with Northern Ireland having to follow EU single market rules without any say. The PM proposed the system would face rolling consent with the Northern Irish Assembly or a review by the executive every four years.    Are there any other problems  Plenty. For a start the UK and the Irish Republic have dferent VAT rates and, after we leave the EU, will charge dferent tarfs on goods. A system will have to be put in place to tax goods exported from Britain to Eire via Northern Ireland. Mr Johnson’s plan is also a much harder Brexit than Theresa May ’s. GDP per capita would fall by up to % in  years, says the UK in a Changing Europe think tank. There is no guarantee on workers’ rights or environmental safeguards. Can he get it through the Commons  The numbers are tight. He needs the support of all  Conservative MPs, the  Tory MPs who’ve lost the Whip, all  DUP MPs and at least one Labour or independent. That takes him to the magic  needed for a majority.

An unnamed terrorist, speaking to Channel  News, said: “The IRA is an army and as an army we are committed to armed struggle for political and social change in Ireland. “Bearing in mind any installation or aspects of British occupation within the Six Counties - be it at the border or where - any infrastructure would be a legitimate target for attack and armed actions against those infrastructures and against the people who are manning them.”    Being interviewed at an IRA safe house, he went on: “It’s important to understand that this is a country under occupation by Britain and as in any colonial situation the people have the right there to respond by all means necessary to that occupation. “Regardless of the form of occupation - whatever kind of border there is, be it soft or so-called hard border - that’s irrelevant. “We are talking about an illegal occupation here that means the IRA reserved the right to attack those who are upholding that illegal occupation along the border and where and the illegal partition that goes with it, and those who are upholding that.”    The man, who was reportedly authorised to speak on behalf of the New IRA army council, said Britain, Ireland and the EU “constantly speak about the border asit’s been there two minutes and it’s only an issue with Brexit”. He added: “There’s been a border since , it’s been resisted, it is being resisted, it will be resisted regardless of any deal formed around it.” The New IRA reached notoriety over the murder of journalist Lyra McKee, , in Londonderry in April.

Leaders in Brussels appeared to be ready to sign on the dotted line after they made positive noises about the end being in sight. And Boris Johnson compared Brexit to being on Everest’s “Hillary Step”, saying we “can see the peak”. But with less than  hours to go before the PM’s crucial EU summit with Brussels, niggles between the Government and the DUP which props it up appeared to have left his deal on a kne-edge. No  said “thorny issues” included arrangements for customs in Northern Ireland and how best to secure “consent” for plans to avoid a hard border with the Republic.The DUP was thought to be being held mainly responsible for the latest impasse as it resisted giving further ground. VAT was also thought to be a sticking point as Brexit’s October  deadline looms.    The optimism from EU leaders appeared to give the ­impression they were happy with Mr Johnson’s deal and it was now up to our own politicians to agree to it. That would also deflect any attempt by the PM to blame Brusselshe leaves empty-handed.DUP leader Arlene Foster and its ­Westminster chief Nigel Dodds were in and out of Downing Street yesterday as Mr Johnson ­desperately struggled to keep them onside.It was thought he was checking what last-minute ­concessions he could offer the EU without losing their backing. But cracks began to show after reports suggested “EU sources” said the DUP had accepted the consent plans.Mrs Foster hit back: “‘EU sources’ are talking nonsense. Discussions continue. Needs to be a sensible deal which ­unionists and nationalists can support.” The sharp words were in contrast to those from EU chiefs. After meetings with leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French ­President Emmanuel Macron, European Council President Donald Tusk said today: “The basic foundations of this ­agreement are ready and ­theoretically we could accept a deal tomorrow.”    Mr Macron added: “I want to believe an agreement is being ­finalised and that we will be able to endorse it tomorrow.” Irish premier Leo Varadkar said: “We have a pathway to a possible deal but there are issues still to be fully resolved. “First is the issue of consent and democracy, ensuring any ­long-term arrangement that applies to Northern Ireland has the assent of the people of Northern Ireland. “Second is the whole issue of customs, ensuring that there is no customs border between north and south and no tarfs on trade.” Mr Johnson rallied Tory ­backbenchers in the Commons with his climbing comparison.He said: “If you’ll excuse a ­mountaineering metaphor, we are at the Hillary Step and the summit, you can see but it’s shrouded in cloud. But we can see it and we will get there.”    Sources also said Mr Johnson compared Brexit to Hollywood film The Shawshank ­Redemption in which the hero escapes jail by wading through a tunnel of sewage. The PM then had talks with the  Committee, followed by a Cabinet meeting. A source said: “He said there was a chance of securing a good deal but we are not there yet and there remain outstanding issues.” EU leaders are due to gather from pm tomorrow.Talks between UK and bloc negotiators are to resume this morning in a fresh race against time as they fight to thrash out a pact which can be agreed at the ­make-or-break summit.    The Commons will vote today on triggering a rare Saturday sitting of Parliament this weekend, from .am to pm, for the first time since the Falkland Islands invasion in . Mr Johnson then has the task of trying to get his deal agreed in the Commons. He needs  votes for a majority.That requires the support of all  Tory MPs,  DUP and all  former Tory MPs he booted out last month for helping torpedo a no-deal departure. He would still be one vote short of the finish line so would require a Labour MP to back a deal.In reality, it is unlikely all of the  expelled Tories would support a Withdrawal Agreement, but up to about a dozen Labour backbenchers could.Others may abstain, lowering the threshold for a Government victory. A vote would be incredibly close but Mr Johnson could triumph.    While details of a possible act are sketchy, critics accuse the PM of wanting to place a customs border down the Irish Sea, something Theresa May during her time in No claimed no British leader could accept.Republican terrorists tonight warned any border infrastructure in Northern Ireland could be an attacked. The chilling threat came from the Real IRA.One terrorist said: “As an army we are committed to armed struggle for political and social change in Ireland. “Any installation or aspects of British occupation within the Six Counties, be it at the border or ­where, would be a legitimate target for attack and armed actions against those infrastructures and against the people manning them.”    If the PM fails to get a deal through the Commons by pm on Saturday, he is legally bound to ask Brussels for a fresh Brexit delay. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said today: “I can confirm, as the Prime Minister has set out, that firstly the Government will comply with the law.” But the PM’s spokesman insisted: “We will be leaving on October .” A ComRes Channel  poll found % of voters still want to leave the EU, as opposed to % for Remain.Up until now  out of  polls since July  have shown Remain ahead. Brexit has cost almost £billion since the  referendum thanks to the economy being .% smaller thanthe UK voted Remain, according to the Centre for European Reform.

Bride Lyndsey Holgate arranged for Hull cross-dresser Regina Sparkles to burst into the wedding - donning a dress and clutching a bouquet - while Yvonne Fairaposs aposIt Should Have Been Meapos played in the background. The sensational stunt, which has since gone viral, shows  guests looking around in shock as she lipsyncs the lyrics while dancing her way down the aisle and making eyes at groom Rob.Regina then goes on to playfully hit him over the head with her flowers before exiting the room, reports Hull Live.  The stunt was all Mrs Holgateaposs idea and she contacted Regina with the plan to set up her husband on their big day on Saturday, October , at  Hull Kingston Rovers ground Craven Park. Rob is usually the joker, so me and my cousin, who was also the maid of honour, decided to do a prank back on him at the wedding, said Mrs Holgate, , of  Kingswood.I saw something similar to what we set up with Regina about a year ago and it inspired me to do the same.I saw the story  in the Hull Daily Mail  about Regina and decided to hire her for the stunt at the confirmation ceremony. We had both got married in Vegas in September but were having a second aposweddingapos as such in front of our loved ones in Hull.As soon as Regina walked in to the room, Rob shouted to my brother and then everyone turned around and started filming.    Me and my cousin and obviously Regina were the only ones that knew about it, so it came as a shock. Happily, Mr Holgate saw the funny side of the prank and the act also kept the guests well entertained. Rob went really red, but he was laughing, Lyndsey added. Itaposs normally him doing the pranks on others, especially when heaposs had a drink as then heaposs always winding people up, so it was funny to see him on the receiving end of it. Iaposm not a traditional person and didnapost want a head table or anything like that, so through the stunt we brought fun to a serious occasion. The video went around all the guests that had joined us in the evening that hadnapost seen what happened and they thought it was hilarious. I even think the video has gone viral now as well.    It was definitely money well spent for the experience and Regina was so professional - I would highly recommend her. The experience of teasing the groom was something that Regina Sparkles also relished. She performs as a vivacious, outgoing and bubbly character throughout Yorkshire and pursued drag as a career in  after securing a business mentor from The Princeaposs Trust. Since then, Regina has worked full time in Hull, Leeds and Manchester and regularly attends LGBT+ events in Yorkshire to help spread the message that apositaposs OK to be youapos.Regina travelled to Market Weighton to buy her dress for the wedding stunt and live streamed the gag on her Facebook page.

Claire Willis, , was on holiday in Turkey when she patted a towel to her face after getting out the shower. The mum-of-two said she felt a pop and rushed to the mirror fearing her eyeball had actually fallen out the socket. Everything was blurry and her eye was red, so she rushed to hospital where medics told her sheaposs perforated her cornea, and told her to fly straight home.  Infection set in - forcing doctors to clamp her eyelids open - and after nine days in hospital she had to have her right eye removed Claire said she looked like an extra from The Walking Dead and has to wait until the socket heals so she can get a prosthetic. Claire from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: Tim and I were getting ready in the hotel room to go meet friends, and as itaposs really hot in Turkey, I had a shower to refresh myself. I was drying myself in the bathroom when I just felt this pop in my eye, followed by extreme blurry vision and an excruciating amount of pain. I thought my eyeball had actually popped out of my socket, thataposs how painful it was.    I raced to the mirror and I couldnapost see any blood or anything - it just looked red and sore and everything was blurry. Tim rushed me to a local hospital and a doctor told me that I had perforated my cornea and that I needed to go back to the UK. I was devastated, and I just couldnapost understand how my le had come to this or where to go from here. Speaking after the op, she added: After the bandages came off, I had to cope with how I looked and the reality hit me. I looked like an extra from The Walking Dead, and I even left my cleaning job at a school because of how it looked - I didnapost want to scare the kiddies. I was having anxiety issues in public, which really isnapost like me. I had to learn alone how to cope with a half amputated eye - it was sticky on the lids and I was scared to clean it in case I knocked the cosmetic shell out.    I never hid my eye though. I didnapost wear sunglasses, Iaposve just worn my everyday glasses and I know itaposs not forever, itaposs only until the prosthetic eye is fitted. I fought my demons, and every day, I pushed myself to go out and slowly but surely, I started feeling more confident. Claire and Timothy, , have been to Turkey every year for the past  years. It was the first day of their annual break in July when tragedy struck after Claire showered in their hotel room in preparation of going to meet friends. She felt a popping sensation in her right eye, leading to a horric amount of pain and a cloudiness of her vision. Bin man Timothy rushed his blinded we to the local hospital where an examination revealed that Claire had perforated her cornea. Devastated Claire was advised tohome to the UK immediately for medical attention and within hours, she was on a flight home with a huge bandage over her poorly eye. She said: Weaposd only been in Turkey for a few hours when I hurt my eye, and we didnapost get to enjoy any of our holiday before I had my accident. My vision had turned cloudy after I felt the pop, but then everything started going dark, and by the time we got to the Turkish hospital, all I could see was blurry lights.  Iaposve suffered with dry eyes in the past and just used eye drops, but never experienced anything like this. I was heartbroken when the doctor told me to go back to the UK, but I knew it was for the best. Thomas Cook were amazing, our hotel rep came straight to the hospital and got us on the next flight home. My eye was all bandaged up so I could fly, which was mortying, but I just wanted to get to the hospital and get it all sorted so I could book a replacement holiday. Claire went straight to Royal Stoke University Hospital when she landed where doctors were shocked to see how infected her eye had become during the flight. Her right eye was fused shut with infection, forcing doctors to clamp her eyelids open to get a look at her eyeball which had turned completely yellow. Claire spent the next nine days in hospital as doctors tried to fight the infection, but it was no use, and the suggestion of amputation was made. She said: I felt so isolated in the hospital, and when they suggested amputation, I was totally against the idea. My dad ended up convincing me to have the eyeball amputated, and although I was devastated at the idea, I was in so much pain that I knew it needed to be done. There was no saving my sight, but the surgeon decided to perform a partial removal of my eyeball rather than a full one. He removed the middle of my eye - the retina and cornea - and fitted a cosmetic shell over the lens of my eye. Claireaposs surgery was a success, and she was allowed tohome just one day after her operation.

Gill Britt, now , was just a teenager when she came to lodge with the Westaposs and their family at the now notorious  Cromwell Street in Gloucester in . She moved there when she was just  as a rebellious punk rocker but has finally revealed she saw first hand the vile abuse meted out to the tragic West children. Gill admitted she was shocked by Roseaposs rough treatment of the children but never felt like she witnessed anything she could report until one day when -year-old Anne Marie West knocked on her door.    She said: “Anne Marie must have been about  and none of the children tended to be allowed in that part of the lodgers house. “I remember Anne Marie, a little tap on my bedsit door and she came in quite distressed. “Where these bruises were on Anne, she pulled down her blouse from the top where the lining of where her bra would be. “She had very pale skin as I recall, very pale. She had black bruises all below her bra line, on her chest, on her breasts.  “I did take it in my stride because I was very naive but I do remember how horric those bruises were. Oh put yourself away Anne. “It didn’t comprehend in my head just how bad this was. I remember her lting her school skirt up and these horrible black bruises were inside her thighs. “Straight away she made it quite clear that people were doing this to her. “In hindsight, at , I would never got my head round it but as I’ve grown up and had children and had le experience. “I know that I know that those injuries were inflicted in a very abusive way.” Anne Marie, who was sexually and physically abused by her vile parents from the age of eight, would eventually escape the house a few years later still unaware Fred had murdered her mum Rena and her two sisters.    She would eventually go on to bravely testy against them in court when their evil deeds were finally exposed. Gillaposs interview was released as part of the ongoing podcast Unheard: The Fred  Rose West Tapes by author and journalist Howard Sounes. In the interview she gives a fascinating insight into daily le inside Cromwell Street where she rented a room on the first floor of the house. She says she often played her records loud, insulating herself from the Wests, who occupied rooms above and below but that she could not help but hear the sinister goings on at times. She explained: “Mum and dad would shout from time to time but when I heard the names that shewould shout at the children like aposeffing bi****apos I would think woah she is a bit angry isnapost she   “My mum would never address me at my worst using any of these words so I would think OK we wonapost be going down to do washing today with Rose in that kind of mood. “So there was a lot of he shouting, a lot of effing and baposing going on and calling the children effing b***** and so on.” Askedshe saw the Wests physically abusing the children she answered: “You would hear it, it was pretty obvious, you would hear her shouting out or she would be chasing them in some way it sounded like that. “You could hear her rowing with them and you hear crying or them shouting aposowwapos or aposget off” and this kind of thing “We never heard Fredaposs raised voice, sometimes you would look at Fred when you heard Roseaposs and his eyes would go up into his head and mine would go up into my head and you would just walk away so he was quite aware that she was shouting and moaning, swearing and using obscene language.” Anne Marie West eventually escaped after marrying boyfriend Chris Davis in  but he also revealed how he witnessed the twisted goings on in the house first hand. He described a house gripped by fear which was also used as a brothel with paying punters turning up night and day to have sex with Rose.  He described how the upstairs rooms in the house were for Fred and Rose and the children but that there was also Roseaposs aposspecial bedroomapos where she took her punters. He said: “It had a four poster bed with netting, bloody spotlights in the corner of each post. “The doorbell would go, she would answer, disappear for god knows how long, and then come back out.” Chris also revealed how he was desperate to tell the police about the sordid events at the house but Anne Marie would never let him. He said: “She told me in confidence but she asked me not tell anyone about what was going on, she said this is between me and you and thataposs it.” “We went through this conversation God knows how many bloody times. “If I has persuaded Anne andshe had decided to do something about it maybe there would be a few more people alive butyou had would they have had enough evidence  But it did go through her mind. “I do remember we did have an argument concerning her parents and one day I said I had had enough I am going to f***ing do something and she said aposfor Christaposs sake donapost Chris because they will kill you and they will kill meapos.” Another man with knowledge of the terrible home le endured by the West children was John Fitzgerald, who led Gloucestershire County Councilaposs inquiry into the Westaposs dealings with social services.

Currently, seven millionaires are made in an average week across all National Lottery games. So to mark it’s birthday next month The Daily Mirror has got the lotto balls rolling and caught up with five people whose lives were transformed forever and asked them the question everybody wants to know – what did they spend their cash on     Adam,  and Amy Pryor, , of Maidstone, Kent won £million on the Euromillions in August  Amy, , said: We won the Lottery after a tough year. Our daughter Charlotte was born seven weeks early, with a cleft palate and while doctors were running tests, more issues emerged. Charlotte was diagnosed with a chromosome  abnormality, and was totally deaf in one ear and partially deaf in another. “The first eight months of her le were spent with repeated hospital visits, and as Amy’s maternity pay was due to end, the cost of getting to hospital in London, train and parking fares added to our worry. I was working six days a week and an extra  hours a month because money was so tight. I played the National Lottery online, so my first thought when I realised I’d won was ‘We won’t have to worry about paying the mortgage.’ “My next thought was that Amy didn’t have to worry about ing to work.  “The money meant we could swap our two-bed terraced house for a four-bed detached home, which is just  yards from the special school that Charlotte will attend. “Before, we had put a little tent and a few sensory lights in the cupboard under the stairs for Charlotte. “But after the win we could spend £, building a special sensory room in the spare bedroom. Charlotte loves this room, and she’s started to reach out for the lights. “She loves the tubes with bubbles and fish and we can see her making huge progress. “Better still, it’s a space which makes her so happy – she laughs and chuckles and doesn’t stop. “She’s a gorgeous little three-year-old girl who loves her cuddles and her music – George Ezra in particular. ”We don’t know exactly what the future holds for her, but we know it’s far brighter than before. “And when Charlotte’s old enough to stand up and look in the mirror in her sensory room, she’ll see a little girl who’s truly loved.”  Lesley,  and Fred Higgins, , of Dundee, Scotland, won £million on EuroMillions last July Lesley, , said: “Once the shock of our win had settled – and it took ages to stop watching the pennies – we decided to help out projects that would last, and span generations. “I was a member of an amateur dramatic group, and knew that another member, Chris Duke, was crowdfunding to raise the £, he needed to pay an illustrator for a children’s book he’d written, helping youngsters to deal with emotions. “It was about a little girl who woke with blue hair, and whose hair changed colour to match her feelings – blue for depression, red for anger, green for envy. “Chris himself had suffered post-natal depression and designed his book to help young people talk about their feelings.  “Back in our day, you’d feel blue but be expected to snap out of it. “We spent around £, helping to get the book published and holding one of the first ever copies in my hand sent tingles up my spine. “In fact, to read the inscription naming us and thanking us brought a tear to my eye. “One young woman who read the book said she wished she’d had it as a teenager, as it would have helped her cope with mood swings. “She was so impressed she planned to keep her copy until she had children herself, so she could read it to them. “We’ve also funded harps for a local harp group. But we’ve still got our old Volvo car.”  Ruth Doyle,  and husband Peter, , of Lyneham Wiltshire won £ million on Euromillions in June  Ruth, , said: “We’ve travelled to amazing places like Japan, the Males, Dubai and Abu Dhabi, but our most important trip came two years after our win, when we drove a van to Romania to rescue  dogs who had been abandoned or left to die. “We were only able to go on our mission because we retired after the win. “I was an accountant, and Peter a consultant decorator trainer. “When we got to Romania and reached the charity’s shelter, Happys, we helped walk and socialise the dogs, and although their stories were heartbreaking, they were the lucky ones – there were abandoned and dead dogs wherever we drove. “We drove the dogs back to the UK through day and night, and we kept going through Red Bull and coffee. “When we arrived back, they went to new homes. We foster dogs ourselves for  Dog At A Time Rescue.Org, and our own two rescue dogs have also benefited from our win.  “We were able to spend £, on a new hip for Bailey, our rescue collie. “He’s nearly ten, and it’s given him a new lease of le. He and our other rescue, Lily, are like children to us. “We’ve rescued  dogs in total, and  of them have been helped through our Lottery win. “We were able to extend the house and create a large bedroom – with plenty of room for us and the dogs to sleep. “Once a year, I fly my siblings to our home in Spain so we can all be together. Winning has been a force for good.”  Neil Jones, , from Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire, won £. million on Lotto in . Neil said: “Nothing beats the feeling when a game all comes together in one go. “You break the balls, you are knocking them all in and as all your practice pays off, your opponent isn’t getting a chance. “The Lottery win enabled me to go back to my love of playing pool, and when I was chosen for the county team – and then had a trial for England in , I was so happy. “The day of my trial, I was thinking of my dad, as I always do when I play. “He passed away a year before my trial, and I can hear him now, saying ‘How’s it going, son ’ “He was always so proud, and it would have made him so happy to know that I was that close to playing for my country. “I have a pool room with memorabilia and a table of trophies, and I play six days out of eight. “The Lottery has enabled me to have the time to practice and compete at this level, and to get better and better.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton channels princess diana","story":"NewsKate Middleton channels Princess Diana as she takes traditional wardrobe for Pakistan tripKate Middleton is taking part in a five-day Royal Tour of Pakistan with husband Prince William, following in the footsteps of Princess Diana who regularly visited the country in the final years of her leShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video kate-william-meet-pakistan-prime-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news kate-middleton-channels-princess-diana-\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Francois Graftieaux, , who has twice requested a DNA sample from the Queen without success, says his family were cut from the Royal bloodline in the early s following the alleged illicit tryst. He claims his father, Pierre-Edouard, was born out of an affair between the-then Prince of Wales and his granny Marie-Leonie Graftieaux - a French seamstress. But Francois alleges that Pierre-Edouard never found his way to the throne after the king abdicated, due to pressure from the Royal Family and the British Government.    This meant his family lost land, titles and wealth - and now heaposs looking for his gran to be included in the history books. Under English law, the Royal Family cannot be prosecuted under criminal law nor sued through the civil courts. But Francois believes a civil action can be brought against Buckingham Palace itself, which serves as the monarchaposs administrative headquarters. The retiree, who bears a striking resemblance to Edward, his claimed late grandfather, said that he has absolutely no interest in compensation.    He is instead looking for closure and for the history books to be rewritten as necessary to reflect his familyaposs place in the sovereigntyaposs lineage - as he has no children of his own. He said: In the s, the true line of succession was unlawfully concealed to block the Graftieauxs from their place in history. Whilst my father and I would have had no direct claim to the throne on account of Edwardaposs abdication, which also precluded his descendants from becoming King, the Graftieauxs would have become nobility at the very least. As the last of my family of Graftieauxs, I will take whatever action is possible and necessary to protect our legacy and to shed light on one of the greatest Royal sex scandals in living memory.    He has requested a DNA sample from the Queen on two previous occasions without success, in  and .  This week, Francois, who now lives in Portugal, wrote to Buckingham Palace for a third time to ask for help. He now says that,this latest plea is ignored, he may be forced to take legal action to force an investigation, possibly under the broad remit of the Human Rights Act.    He said: I am not asking the Palace for money, title or power but merely to ascertain the identity of my grandfather and the circumstances surrounding my fatheraposs birth. If the Palace again refuses to cooperate, which I strongly suspect it will, then I am happy to seek legal advice and let what amounts to the largest Royal sex scandal in history play out in public through the courts. Francoisapos own research began shortly after the death of Pierre-Edouard in . The soldier had never revealed the identity of Francoisapos grandfather to him, other than that he was someone famous who had not been allowed to marry your grandmother.    After a casual remark by a former girlfriend that Francois strongly resembled the Duke of Windsor, the title Edward took on his abdication, he began searching the family archives to find the missing piece in his ancestry. Francois believes the pair met at the Luna Park in Paris and continued a clandestine relationship for two years whenever Edward could escape from his wartime duties. But when Marie-Leonie fell pregnant in  Edward ended the relationship and allegedly bought her silence. This money that helped her to become one of Franceaposs leading fashion designers almost overnight - transforming her from penniless to plush.

Thirty-four planes the airline either leased or owned are currently spread around Europe and the UK, where they will  likely remain grounded and updated with new branding before going to new operators. Several of these planes are now being stored and maintained at Newquay airport, in Cornwall - which is expecting several more arrivals in coming days. Thomas Cook collapsed last month after failing to secure an extra £m needed to keep it afloat. The firmaposs collapse also triggered the biggest ever peacetime repatriation, which aimed at bringing more than , holidaying Britons back home. The tour operators failure saw thousands of people lose jobs - including , in the UK.     When Thomas Cook went into liquidation the firmaposs fleet of planes -  of which they leased -  was stranded and not allowed to fly, the BBC reported.  Several of these planes have been spotted in Newquay, Cornwall, where they are being put through regular maintenance checks and full engine runs. Ryan Winfield, from Apple Aviation, said some of the stranded aircraft were being retrieved by flight operations companies. At Newquay they are being put in to storage and maintained in an airworthy condition until such time the aircraft owner makes a decision on the plans for them, likely moving to new operators, he said.    Apple Aviation was currently storing four Thomas Cook planes ahead of their reassignment. Engineers have to make regular checks to ensure they remain airworthy. Aircraft engineer Sam Hughes lost his job with Thomas Cook in Manchester but has been employed by Apple Aviation in Newquay. He said he had been aposquite fortunateapos to find work but his former colleagues were aposangry and guttedapos at the travel firmaposs demise. But it could be months before the holiday jets are rebranded and repainted for new owners. In the hours after the travel firm - which has been in operation since  - ceased trading, the government came under fire for not putting a rescue package together.    And calls have been mounted for senior figures within the company togenerous bonuses as , UK workers saw their jobs wiped out. Peter Fankhauser told MPs yesterday he was deeply sorry he failed to save the company but he looked uncomfortable as the chair of the business committee suggested he should personally cough up. Mr Fankhauser has previously said half of the £.million package he got since  came is now worthless shares in the travel giant. Meanwhile some , of the travel giantaposs , UK staff were not paid their month’s wages due at the end of last month. Kicking off the grilling of the boss in parliament yesterday, Chair Rachel Reeves said: Your apologies would perhaps ring a bit more trueyou were willing to do something about it. She told the former CEO: At the moment Iaposm afraid Mr Frankhauser the number of times youaposve said apossorryapos when youaposre not willing to put something back.    Asked about his pay Mr Fankhauser said: Iaposm not going to try and defend my base pay because in relation to a normal workeraposs base salary this is a normal amount. But he insisted that he worked extremely hard and exhaustively hard for the money. Meanwhile, a website has been set up by the Civil Aviation Authority through which Thomas Cook customers could claim refunds for their trips. It was set up to enable people with Atol-protected bookings for Thomas Cook holidays due to begin after the firm collapsed on September  to obtain refunds.

If these allegations prove to be true, they would have to be punished and quick consequences be put in place, she said.  A possible revocation of the animal testing licence is being checked by LavesThe shocking footage was recorded by undercover workers from animal rights organisations Soko Tierschutz and Cruelty Free International . In the footage monkeys are seen crying while they hang from metal harnesses strapped to their necks, before they are stuffed into tiny cages. The eight-minute clip also shows toxicology tests being carried out on cats, dogs and rabbits, leaving them in a highly distressed state. The animal rights charities have had success with targeting animal testing laboratories before.

As a result the institute stopped its controversial monkey brain experiments.

Another added: How is it even possible in   I feel so bad about what I saw today, I canapost imagine what those poor living creatures have endured....in the name of progress and technology  According to CFI, tests carried out at the laboratory involve poisoning animals to see how much of a chemical or drug it takes to cause serious harm, in an attempt to measure what a ‘safe’ dose for humans might be.  They claim the animals are injected with or made to eat or inhale increasing amounts of a substance to measure the toxic effects. The horric effects include vomiting, internal bleeding, respiratory distress, fever, weight loss, lethargy, skin problems, organ failure and even death. CFI claim animals are not given pain relief or anaesthetics. The undercover worker said staff are not trained animal carers and were often violent towards the animals. They said they witnessed beagles bleeding after the experiments in which pipes forced were down their throat as they were given capsules.  Michelle Thew, CFI chief executive, is calling for the laws to be changed. He said: Our investigation has uncovered appalling animal suffering, inadequate care, poor practices and breaches of European and German law. We are calling for LPT to be closed. We are also calling for a comprehensive review into the use of animals in regulatory toxicity testing in Europe, including the UK.

The animals were filmed suffering painful wounds and even resorting to cannibalism because they were so distressed, campaigners claim. Mink lay dead in their tiny, filthy cages and others had ­injuries including infected eyes, cuts and weeping sores. Repetitive cage pacing and head swaying was also witnessed, classic signs of mental distress and boredom. Fur farms were banned in Britain in . But Finland exports millions of pounds of fur to here each year.    Humane Society International UK, which discovered the harrowing scenes of animal misery at  farms in the Nordic country, wants fur sales stopped. The charity’s Claire Bass said: “All of this suffering to provide a frivolous product the fashion industry does not need. The UK imports millions of pounds of fur from Finland with many unsuspecting British consumers buying from farms like the ones we visited. “It’s tragic to think that fur from the baby foxes we saw on these farms could one day end up on a UK shop shelf. “We saw a few hundred of the millions of foxes and mink in miles of battery cages. These poor young animals exist only as vessels for their fur, as broken and tormented souls. “Despite what the fur trade tries to portray on catwalks, there is nothing glamorous about fur. As long as the UK allows British businesses to trade in fur, we are complicit in the cruelty.  “Britain was the first country in the world to ban fur farming, now it’s time for us to finish the job and become the first country in the world to ban sales too.” Towie TV star Pete Wicks, who joined the charity on the investigation, added: “It was ­sickening, I don’t believe anyone who has seen the state of these poor animals, terried and trapped in tiny cages, would ever wear fur again. “It’s great the UK banned fur farming, but it doesn’t make sense that we’re still selling fur from farms like these.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sas troops almost blown up","story":"NewsSAS troops almost blown up after ISIS booby-trap dead childrens bodiesThe small SAS convoy noticed  hidden grenades when they stopped to check on two kids lying by the road in north-eastern SyriaShareCommentsByChris HughesDefence and Security Editor:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video isis-militants-escape-prison-syria-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news sas-troops-almost-blown-up-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Four of the group approached the children – believed to be brother and sister, aged around five and eight years – carrying medical bags. After inspecting them, they realised they were dead and found  deadly grenades beneath them.    Wires were attached to the grenades’ pins, taped to the corpses and buried in the ground. Any attempt to move the children would have tugged on the wires, removing the grenades’ pins, and cause a massive blast, killing those who came to their aid. Fearing there could also be mines or roadside bombs planted nearby, the team searched the road for explosives and then spent an hour dismantling the grenade necklace which had been laid under the kids. The soldiers dug a grave at the side of the road, buried them and paid their respects marking the spot with a series of stones. A source said : “They were heading towards Iraq when we saw the kids, you see lots of bodies but kids are dferent and we thought they might be alive and couldn’t just drive past. “They know IS used bodies to hide IEDs and carefully checked to seethey were alive, quickly spotting more than a dozen grenades hooked up to them - sadly they were both dead. “It is thought they were brother and sister. They couldn’t leave them lying there, so cleared the threat, buried them together and said a quick payer, it wasn’t much but they could in dficult circumstances.” Despite IS’s defeat in Syria there are thousands of Islamic State extremists still at large in sleeper cells bent on revenge.    The heavily- armed SAS patrol had been operating in north east Syria with other special forces units when it was ordered to withdraw to the Iraq border following the decision by the Turks to mount an offensive against the Kurds. President Trump’s sudden move to pull out , American special forces troops paved the way for the Turkish invasion which has threatened genocide against Kurds. Yesterday Russian troops, who along with Syrian regime forces, have come to the rescue of Kurdish troops in “deal with the devil” rescue pact, continued their advance towards Turkish lines. But Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defied pressure for a ceasefire in Syria and said the only way the offensive would end wasSyrian Kurdish fighters leave a designated border area. Russia said it was working to prevent a conflict between Turkish troops and Syrian government forces that have moved into Kurdish-held areas in the northeast. The American move effectively abandoned the Kurdish fighters who were allied with the US and cleared the way for Turkey’s invasion aimed at crushing them. In an address to his ruling party legislators, Erdogan said Turkey would not be coerced into stopping its offensive. He vowed to press ahead with the incursion until Turkish troops reach a depth of - miles inside Syria along a border area where Turkey intends to form a “safe zone”.

Tragically, Mariam has been left to raise her massive family alone after her husband walked out on her almost four years ago. Now , doctors have taken action to stop Mariam having more children after it emerged her father had  children with several dferent women. Mariam has three sets of quadruplets, four sets of triplets and six sets of twins and incredibly manages to care for and feed them all on her own. The fertile mum was just  when she was married to her husband, who at  was  years her senior.    Just a year later she gave birth to her first set of twins. Now, she and all of her kids have no choice to live in appallingly cramped conditions in just four tiny homes made from cement bricks and a corrugated iron roof. Mariam, from Uganda, and her brood live surrounded by coffee fields. A doctor warned the mother that birth control, like the Pill, could cause her problems because she had unusually large oies. So after her first set of twins, the babies just kept coming.    Ugandan families are often large with women having . children on average. This is one of the highest birth rates in Africa but even by these standards, Mariamaposs family is enormous. At just , Mariam had  children and desperately begged her doctor for help to stop her having any more. But once again the medical advice was that she should keep getting pregnant because her oy count was so high. Mariamaposs final pregnancy three years ago ended in tragedy when she gave birth to her sixth set of twins.    One of the babies died while she was in labour and then her husband, who would often leave for weeks on end, left her for good. His name is now cursed in her family. Mariam said: I have grown up in tears, my man has passed me through a lot of suffering. All my time has been spent looking after my children and working to earn some money. But it was also after this birth that the mum finally got the medical help she needed to stop her having more babies.    Dr Charles Kiggundu, a gynecologist at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, said: Her case is genetic predisposition to hyper-ovulate, which is releasing multiple eggs in one cycle, which signicantly increases the chance of having multiples it is always genetic. Mariam confirmed that doctors had taken action to remove the risk of her becoming pregnant again. She said the doctor told her he had cut my uterus from inside. Nothing will come in the way of the dedicated mother doing all she can to provide for her children. She works as a hairdresser, an event decorator and collects and sells scrap metal.    Mariam brews her own local gin to sell and makes herbal medicine. And she is determined her surviving children will have the very best start to le with most of her wages going on food, medical care, clothes and school fees. Hanging proudly on the wall of her tiny home are photos of her eldest children graduating from school. Despite Mariamaposs best efforts, one of her children, Ivan Kibuka, had to quit school to help raise the family. The -year-old said: Mum is overwhelmed, the work is crushing her, we help where we can, like in cooking and washing, but she still carries the whole burden for the family. I feel for her.    Even Mariamaposs early years were filled with heartbreak. Her mum walked out on her, her father and her five brothers and sisters just three days after she gave birth to Mariam. He father re-married and Mariamaposs step-mother poisoned her older siblings by mixing cut glass in with their food. They all died. A visit to a relative meant Mariam escaped with her le. She said: I was seven years old then, too young to even understand what death actually meant.    I was told by relatives what had happened. The scars of her ordeal meant Mariam was desperate for a family of her own to love, although she admits she only ever wanted six children. Her youngsters have to make the best of what she manages to provide as a single parent. Metal bunk beds with thin mattresses are where  of her brood sleep in one small room with walls caked with grime. Others have to share mattresses on the floor while some of the children are forced to sleep in the dirt because there is simply no space.    Everyone piles in to help with chores like cooking and clearning while the older children look after their younger siblings. Each day, Mariam uses kgs of maize floor to ensure her children have enough to eat. Although fish and meat are rare treats for the family. Mariam has to be organised to make sure each day runs smoothly on there is a rota of cooking and washing duties on a wooden board in the family home.

Promoters have welcomed the move as an opportunity for other producers who have access to a wider range of talent.One large firm, which spoke to the Tele on the condition of anonymity, said: “This is a very big positive#this is about partnership with promoters, and building bridges.”DF Concerts, the firm behind T In The Park and TRNSMT, is staging Bombay Bicycle Club, Bfy Clyro and the Libertines gigs at the Caird Hall before the year is out and previously expressed an interest in Slessor Gardens.The council’s approach to promoters comes after poor sales of tickets for recent shows.The latest gig at Slessor, DunDee s, failed to pull in as many punters as previous acts such as Little Mix, Olly Murs and Steps.There was criticism over scheduling of the s show as it was on the same date as a Madness gig in Montrose, which had been announced months beforehand.And Craig David’s Slessor summer show was moved to the Caird Hall, which has a quarter of the garden’s capacity.LHG claimed the move was due to “unforeseen circumstances”.Concertgoers were also angry after cut-price tickets were offered on discount website Itison just weeks after full-price briefs went on sale.Dundee City Council declined to expand on why it was now approaching other promoters, instead reissuing the same statement it provided to the Tele earlier this year.It said: “There is no long-term agreement or exclusivity agreement in place for Slessor Gardens with any promoters.“The council is continuing to carefully consider the future of the space as a venue.”Meanwhile, LHG, which previously said discussions had been “ongoing” regarding exclusivity, said it would “not be appropriate” to comment on discussions about future shows in Dundee.A spokeswoman said: “We remain committed to working with Dundee City Council and the city’s key stakeholders to realise our joint aspiration in ensuring Dundee remains a culturally vibrant and economically sustainable city.“We firmly believe a series of high quality, safe and appropriate concerts on Slessor Gardens is a key driver to help achieve this.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/barry-smith.jpg ","title":"dundee legend barry smith appointed assistant manager to jim weir at forfar","story":"Barry Smith has been appointed assistant manager at Forfar after boss Jim Weir decided to make changes to his coaching staff.The former Dundee, Aldershot, East Fe, Raith Rovers and Brechin City manager will bring a wealth of coaching and management experience to his new role and takes up the post with immediate effect.Following discussions, Gary Irvine has agreed to concentrate on his playing role at the League One club and long-serving Barry Sellars will be stepping aside from his coaching role and leaving Station Park.Sellars joined the club in a playing capacity under Ian McPhee nearly  years ago and, apart from a four-year spell back with home-town club Arbroath and one season up at Peterhead, he has served the Loons well in both a playing and coaching capacity since and has been a popular figure around the club.Weir has been hit by a further injury blow with midfielder Murray MacKintosh joining Dale Hilson and Andy Jackson on the sidelines after the ankle injury he picked up at Dumbarton in the Loons’ last outing failed to respond to treatment.MacKintosh has been ruled out for several weeks, while striker Hilson is to go for a scan on the leg injury he suffered against Falkirk a month ago and fellow-frontman Jackson is still recovering from a severe concussion.“Unfortunately, injuries appear to be a feature of this season so far,” Weir said.“Murray’s one is the latest and it will be a few weeks until I have a full squad available.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5da5853128f723.96970323-424x564.jpg ","title":"dundee winger josh mcpake keen to prove himself at dens during loan spell","story":"Winger Josh McPake is determined to make his name at Dundee during his season-long loan spell at Dens Park.The Rangers youngster joined up with namesake James McPake’s side this summer to gain some much-needed first-team experience.The -year-old has impressed in spells for the Dark Blues this season with his quick feet and direct running.He’s been in and out of the team lately but he’s eager to get more of a taste of first-team football.He said: “I’m really enjoying it at Dundee and playing in the Championship.

clarke hails dundee united man shankland as scots romp to victory","story":"Scotland boss Steve Clarke was impressed by Lawrence Shankland’s overall performance as the Dundee United striker scored on his first international start.Shankland claimed his th goal of the season in a - win over San Marino on Sunday, netting from the rebound after Scott McTominay’s effort had crashed off the bar .The -year-old forward made his debut as a half-time substitute in the - defeat in Russia but was more involved at Hampden as Scotland got back to winning ways following four consecutive defeats.Clarke said: “I thought he was good, a lot of good hold-up play, links the play well, gets the ball in.“Scored a striker’s goal, right on the margin of offside when the ball came back off the bar.“He was unlucky, the goalkeeper made an unbelievable save from him and he had another chance as well, so he could have had a few goals.“Lawrence is a goalscorer, he has impressed working with the group and I am pleased he has got a goal on his debut, and not the only one – Stuart Findlay got a goal on his debut, which is great for Stuart.”The newcomers were upstaged by John McGinn, who netted a first-half hat-trick.The Aston Villa midfielder now has seven goals for the season, four of them for his country.“He’s a goalscorer, he has shown that in the English Premier League,” Clarke said.“If you can score goals at that level, you can score goals at any level.“They have found a really good way of playing John at Aston Villa, where he is always up supporting the striker and getting on the end of second balls in and around the box.”Meanwhile, Stuart Findlay hailed the comprehensive - victory over San Marino as the “peak of my career so far” after he marked his first cap with a goal and an assist.After setting up McGinn’s third goal with a firm downward header at the end of the first half, the Kilmarnock centre-back got on the scoresheet himself when he nodded in Ryan Christie’s corner to put Scotland - up.Findlay – the first Kilmarnock player to score for Scotland since  – said netting on his international debut at Hampden Park was a childhood dream.“It’s an amazing feeling for myself,” the -year-old said.“It’s probably the peak of my career so far. To score on my debut at Hampden is something I’ve dreamt of as a little boy so it’s a really special moment for me.“I’ve looked up and seen my mum and dad in the stand for the national anthem and that’s a moment I’ve been able to savour forever.“But the most important thing was we knew we had a game to play and I know it’s a game we’re expected to win. But to go out, score six goals and keep a clean sheet – we’ve done what was expected and, hopefully, we can kick-start our form from here.”A first-half hat-trick from Villa midfielder McGinn had put Scotland - up at the break, while there were also goals for substitute Stuart Armstrong and home debutant Shankland in the second half of the Euro  qualying Group I fixture.Findlay said it was a special night for both him and Dundee United striker Shankland, who he has known since childhood.He added: “I’ve known Lawrence from when we were little boys, we used to play against each other aged eight and nine so I’ve known him all the way through.“I was over the moon to see him score and then to get one myself was a really special moment for the two of us.“We might not have been involved at this level not very long so it just shows you how quickly football can turn and I’m delighted for Lawrence.“Just to get your first cap anywhere is incredible but to do it at Hampden is just something you dream of when you’re growing up and it’s something I’ll always remember.”The victory saw Scotland move up one place in Group I, above Kazakhstan to within a point of third-placed Cyprus with two matches remaining.Clarke’s side face that pair next month."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.37631273-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.37631273-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.37631273-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.37631273-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"win 100 with the teles fantastic strictly come dancing competition every friday","story":"Every Friday whilst Strictly Come Dancing is gracing our TVs the Tele is giving you the chance to cash in!Every Friday, each copy of the Eveningwill have the name of one of the dancers taking part on the show printed on the front page along with a Unique Reference Number.If your dancer is voted off on Sunday then you are in with a chance to win £!TO ENTER:Simply enter your dancer#s name and Unique Reference Number in the boxes below along with your contact details…that’s it!Good luck!Terms  Conditions:Entrants must register by midnight on Saturday, .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

Newlands hit back just before the break.Star were up against it for large spells of the second half but the back three of Andy Weir, Ricky Reid and Ben Forbes defended well with Ally Lewis doing well in goals.The visitors took the lead again with  minutes remaining when Angus Lewis fired home a goal of the season contender from  yards.The Lochgilphead side were perhaps a bit naïve as they chased the killer third goal, instead of playing for time in the corners.They were punished with the last attack of the  minutes when Newlands scored from a corner which took a wicked bounce on the way through making he score -.An uneventful  minutes of extra time took place, with both goalkeepers untroubled, before the match went to penalty kicks and it was the home side who prevailed -. Star goalscorers were Ben Forbes, Coll McCallum and Andy Weir.Red Star have a free weekend tomorrow because of the holiday weekend and will start their league campaign the following week, hoping to have the majority of their first team players back fit."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column september 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe weather was kind to the youthful climate change protesters and they certainly made their presence felt in Lochgilphead and Tarbert.The fundamental mindsets of people across the globe has to change fastwe are going to make any impression on what seems to be a climate change juggernaut.Do we need that plastic packaging on our fruit and vegetables  Is there an alternative to taking a flight to our destination  Could we buy local rather than importing produce It all starts with inidual responsibility.

As a warm up for their main stage gig on Sunday, The Mad Ferret Band drew in the crowds at The Corner House, while Gubbed had the Islay Frigate dance floor well used as they rocked the night away.The jam session in the harbour marquee on Saturday afternoon brought together a host of musicians, while a fantastic £. for festival funds was raised at the coffee morning held at Templar Arts and Leisure Centre.The Mad Ferret Band eased the Sunday survivors into the day’s event at the quay but it was not long before the crowd were back on their feet dancing and singing along. The great musical entertainment continued throughout the afternoon with performance from Gary Innes and Rhuvaal.Speaking after the weekend-long event, organiser Margaret MacNeill said: #Thanks to everybody who helped out with the coffee morning. Special thanks also to all the bands and everyone who came to support Tarbert Music Festival.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

Her partner Rebecca Taylor read music as an organ scholar at Lincoln College, Oxford before attending the Royal Academy of Music where she was a Junior Fellow and completed the MA in Piano Accompaniment.The audience were introduced to the pair with an intense piece by Mozart about burning letters and it certainly woke us up. We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness. It was aAs a light and fun ending we were given #I can be a sexy lady#, a piece about poor mezzos and how they always play boys and not much  in operas.

John Kennedy played the ball between the penalty spot and the D where Allan MacDonald let the ball run across his body before turning and blasting home, giving Cameron Sutherland no chance in the Oban goal.There were harsh words in the Oban Camanachd dressing room at half-time and revamp saw Keith MacMillan replace Gary McKerracher whilst the forward line switched to a three-one formation with Andrew MacCuish on the D.The switches paid idends when the home side drew level just four minutes into the second half when Daniel MacCuish ran forward and Daniel MacVicar volleyed the ball into the net to make it -.Oban Camanachd took the lead on  minutes when Andrew MacCuish’s turn and shot flew past the keeper.Just a couple of minutes later, Andrew MacCuish turned provider as he found Scott MacMillan who finished with a low drive from the left although his effort may have taken a slight deflection.Two of the game’s best young goalkeepers were on show, and Inveraray’s Scott MacLachlan saved his side from a bigger defeat though Oban Camanachd did have to rely on Cameron Sutherland who made good saves near the end from Garry MacPherson and Allan MacDonald.The win for Oban Camanachd means that they and Kyles are the only sides, other than championship favourites Kingussie, in the title race as the season moves into the closing stages."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 11 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowACHA tenantIt has been a while since we carried a story where a tenant has a complaint about a housing association property.

These are big, old oaks.Appearing in support of the application, Gavin Yuill, of Galashiels-based Camerons Architects, said: ldquoIn relation to the design and placemaking, the one-and-a-half storey houses proposed are the most common house type in the rural Scottish Borders and in Minto village.ldquoThe two nearest neighbouring houses are both one-and-a-half storey, the set back of both proposed houses is consistent with the street and the stone, wet dash rendered walls, timber cladding, timber windows and doors, natural slate roofs and metal gutters are all consistent with the high-quality materials used in traditional Minto village.ldquoThe overwhelming number of retained trees, the replacement of all lost trees, and substantial new screen and hedge planting will reinforce the existing habitats and ensure that the bioersity is maximised.ldquoThese are demonstrated by the proposed landscaping drawings provided with the application.Also appearing in support of the applicant was Tim Ferguson, of Galashiels-based Ferguson Planning.He told the committee: ldquoA review of the housing analysis into the forthcoming local development plan again shows the signicant benefits windfall sites of this nature can have in meeting housing delivery targets.ldquoThe delivery of the annual housing targets are short of where they require to be and thusproposals of this nature will assist in meeting local needs.ldquoA signicant amount of housing within the Scottish Borders is met via small developments and self-build and indeed has occurred where within the confines of Mintorsquos settlement.ldquoThis subject site falls within the settlement boundary of Minto and is clearly in compliance with related planning policy principles and which has no defined restrictions upon it.Councillors also heard that planning officers are recommending the application be approved, subject to conditions.Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison said: ldquoMuch is made by the objectors that the buildings are not in keeping with Minto, yet the report from officers says that there are no two buildings the same in the village.ldquoTo be honest, they look okay to me but Irsquod need to see them in the context of what is already there.ldquoThe houses already there donrsquot look hugely architecturally important to me but perhaps Irsquom a Philistine.Members of the committee agreed to conduct a site visit, and to reconsider the application at the next meeting of the planning and building standards committee, which is due to meet on Monday, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"planned-early-years-centre-given-go-ahead","story":"COUNCIL planners have approved proposals to extend St Ronanrsquos Primary School in Innerleithen.Scottish Borders Council wants to construct a single-storey extension on the school, in order to meet demand generated by the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to increase entitlement to free early learning and childcare provision.The new space will cater for  children, with  spaces allocated to two to three year olds, and  space set aside for three to five year olds.The plans will also see the relocation of the existing play area, a pumping station and water tank, and fenced nursery garden.A design statement, submitted by the councilrsquos in-house architect, reads: ldquoAccessibility and inclusivity have been a key focus during the design development.ldquoThe provision will be universally accessible and will offer a high-quality learning environment for the children and teaching staff.ldquoThe proposal has been developed to meet current and future teaching with the primary focus being on teaching spaces that are flexible and adaptive to cater for a iety of needs and learning experiences.ldquoThe design ethos has been simplied to provide a hierarchy of spaces from the two to three year oldrsquos playroom up to the three to five year oldrsquos playrooms with intermittent shared activity spaces in-between.ldquoLarge bi-folding doors within the play areas creates easy passage between the indoors and outdoors, encouraging independence and providing additional learning opportunities.ldquoA large canopy running theof the building strengthens the pedagogy of a seamless transition between the spaces and enables children to stay outdoors in wet weather conditions.ldquoFurthermore, it minimises solar gain during sunny weather.

Perceptive, spirited and loving.\"Photographer Allan, who has been publishing his work since the s, spent decades in locations such as Vietnam, Morocco, Libya and Australia to produce unforgettable images.Since ing home earlier this year he has released photographic titles, Vintage Tractors and Scotlands Islands, before putting the final shots together for Edinburgh.Allan admits that Gerdas involvement has taken the publication to a new level. He said: \"My initial concept was to produce a comparatively modest format, aimed at the photographically conscious visitor.\"By good fortune however, in engaging with Gerda as co-author, the scope and spirit of the work has been widened and deepened.\"The poems featured in this book have interacted with my images penetrating the veneer that can often dominate the city.\"All those prestigious castings and fine masonry may, collectively, have created one of Europersquos most beautul cities, but there were struggles in its making, and so often a human price was paid.\"I hope, therefore, it proves thought provoking at the very least.Gerda, who is an award-winning actor, songwriter and director as well as a writer, added: \"This has been a fascinating and welcome collaboration ndash an opportunity to reacquaint myself with my beloved home city, and its many contradictions.\"Irsquove relished both the process of responding to Allanrsquos vibrant images, and the way in which the project unexpectedly developed: finding myself writing additional poems about aspects of the city which Allan then went out to photograph.\"The journey towards finding a visual and poetic narrative

The ladies# choirs are going well and the men’s group has recruited a few more, though still not enough.’So here is the challenge to the men of Kintyre, especiallythey enjoy singing in the car, in the shower or anywhere , don’t know how much fun it is to sing in a group and would like an activity which helps forget worries: go along to Campbeltown Town Hall at pm on Tuesday September  or telephone   and give the men’s group a try.The women are meeting separately. You don’t have to audition or read music you just have to enjoy singing. Being part of a group is more fun with more back-up and less daunting than singing on your own.Paula added: ‘The challenge for the women of Campbeltown and Kintyre is to persuade your men folk to give singing a chance.’"},{"url":null,"title":"campbeltown picture house joins in with into film festival","story":"The festival, which runs from November  to , is hosted by British film education charity Into Film, which runs film-based programmes for children aged five to .This year’s festival comprises eight strands which can help educators navigate the packed programme: Mental Wellbeing and Identity, Language and Creativity, The Natural World, Exploring History, Debate, Fantasy and Adventure, Rebellion, and Musicals.CPH is showing Beautul Boy for secondary pupils, Singin# in the Rain for primary pupils and The Grinch for families.The cinema#s manager, Ellen Mainwood, said: #Into Film has become a popular part of Campbeltown Picture House#s calendar and inviting the young people in to enjoy a free screening is such a privilege.#This year, Campbeltown children were given the task of deciding which films would be screened in the Musicals category so it#s fun to now see those films being watched by children across the country.#Dferent movies will also be on offer in Dunoon Burgh Hall and at Oban Phoenix Cinema.Kirsty Gallacher, Into Film programme delivery manager for Scotland, said: #Film is a powerful tool for learning and engagement.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

He rummaged in it for while.ldquoAh, here it is, he said, holding an old photo album.He gave it to his daughter.She looked at it and smiled.ldquoCan I see  asked her son.So they all sat together with the photo.ldquoWell, thatrsquos your granny and that wee girl whose hand she is holding is your mum, said the granddad.ldquoThatrsquos my mum ldquoYes, and her mum, your granny, was loads of fun.

to discuss the proposals at their next meeting, which takes place later this month.According to the plans, a total of  affordable homes ndash made up of the  one-bedroom flats, eight two-bedroom

proposals so as not to rule themselves out of any future debate.Mr McGinn said: ldquoWhat is really clear is there is a strength of opinion out there about the amount of houses getting developed at

Why would they  Ms Sturgeon has been consistent from the outset: her party will not vote for any deal that takes Scotland and the UK out of the single market and customs union, causing untold damage to the Scottish economy. And since the current prime minister favours a harder, more isolationist and ideologically right-wing Brexit than even that fashioned by Mrs May, it is surely incumbent upon all UK opposition parties to fight tooth and nail to save the country from such a disastrous and isive path.Thatrsquos why they have no option but to vote down Mr Johnsonrsquos deal and force a general election, the circumstances of which will be vital in determining how it can be framed. After all, itrsquos not just Mr Johnsonrsquos tenure that must be keep short, but his list of options.The Lib Dems under Jo Swinson wonrsquot vote for any deal, not least because ldquogetting Brexit done would render their new \"stop Brexit altogether\" mandate redundant. And though itrsquos perhaps inevitable that some of the rebel Tories sitting on opposition benches might end up voting for the PMrsquos dealothers might decide to stick it to their former party and put the interests of the country first, especially since they are likely to lose their jobs anyway.

Would they be that stupid  I fear they would. It would be a cruel but perhaps not unexpected ironyLabour enabled a devastating hard Brexit to be foisted upon our poorest people.There is, as yet, no deal to put to parliament.

The outspoken Guy Verhofstadt, who has not been slow to comment on the ldquointernal affairs of authoritarian countries from Hungary to Hong Kong, has been silent on the most egregious violation of basic civil rights seen in Europe since the creation of the EU.The EU is supposed to uphold the European Convention on Human Rights. Its own Charter of Fundamental Rights includes, under Article , on political freedom: ldquothe right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association at all levels, in particular in political, trade union and civic matters.The imprisonment of elected politicians, who have never incited violence, is an offence against every citizen of the EU. These sentences should be overturned in the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg, and hopefully, they will be.But today there needs to be more than head-shaking by leaders of other EU countries. Politicians who routinely condemn Vladimir Putin seem unable to see the hypocrisy in failing to condemn Madrid.

The reason: he canrsquot interfere with the law of the land. One hopes that the silence from Mr Corbyn does not indicate any solidarity with Mr Sanchezrsquos rigid adherence to undemocratic laws.Indeed, Spain is a lesson for radical politicians in the UK not to place too much faith in the efficacy of Supreme Courts. Those at the SNP conference whorsquove been talking about pursuing independence through the courts should take note. The law is politics by other means, and Supreme Courts are supremely political institutions.The fact that Lady Hale gave Boris Johnson short shrt over proroguing parliament doesnrsquot mean that the Supreme Court is going to be kind to Scottish nationalism. In , the UK Supreme Court dismissed out of hand the Sewel Convention ndash the right of Holyrood to withhold consent to any laws passed by Westminster that cut across the powers of the Scottish parliament.

Ms Sturgeon has condemned the behaviour of the Spanish government, but she should also be making clear her discontent with the EU. Brussels is deeply ambivalent about state repression, whether in France against the Gilet Jaunes, or against the Catalans in Spain. Even when the UK is out of the EU, it is naiumlve to expect that Brussels will necessarily support Scotlandit comes to a constitutional breakdown with Westminster.These are dark times. All the more so because of the double standards of liberal opinion in the UK. We continually hear warnings about impending fascism in Britain. Columnists warn about the threat to democracy from Tommy Robinson, from Boris Johnson, from Brexiters. But here is real fascist repression taking place right now in one of the largest countries in the European Union.Itrsquos time for European governments to condemn this wilful regression to authoritarianism. The Spanish state should be diplomatically shunned by the British Government until it releases these political prisoners, just as countries like Russia are shunned. Madrid must be made to realise that this kind of repression cannot succeed.By reviving the spirit of Franco in st century Europe, Spain has squandered any sympathy for its centralist cause. It is legitimate to argue against Catalan independence it is legitimate to fight elections opposing it. But by breaking heads, dismissing elected governments and then imprisoning peaceful politicians, Madrid has acted in defiance of international law.

The outspoken Guy Verhofstadt, who has not been slow to comment on the ldquointernal affairs of authoritarian countries from Hungary to Hong Kong, has been silent on the most egregious violation of basic civil rights seen in Europe since the creation of the EU.The EU is supposed to uphold the European Convention on Human Rights. Its own Charter of Fundamental Rights includes, under Article , on political freedom: ldquothe right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association at all levels, in particular in political, trade union and civic matters.The imprisonment of elected politicians, who have never incited violence, is an offence against every citizen of the EU. These sentences should be overturned in the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg, and hopefully, they will be.But today there needs to be more than head-shaking by leaders of other EU countries. Politicians who routinely condemn Vladimir Putin seem unable to see the hypocrisy in failing to condemn Madrid. Liberal newspapers like theshow their ambivalence by reporting the fate of Catalan political prisoners as ldquoa warning to Scottish nationalists.Seriously  A warning of what, precisely  They are surely not suggesting that an unlawful Scottish referendum could result in anything remotely similar.:Former Catalan leader Oriol Junqueras jailed over independence referendumWhat should be deeply worrying to the UK Left is that the imprisonment of the Catalan independistas has been condoned by the Socialist Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez. The reason: he canrsquot interfere with the law of the land. One hopes that the silence from Mr Corbyn does not indicate any solidarity with Mr Sanchezrsquos rigid adherence to undemocratic laws.Indeed, Spain is a lesson for radical politicians in the UK not to place too much faith in the efficacy of Supreme Courts. Those at the SNP conference whorsquove been talking about pursuing independence through the courts should take note. The law is politics by other means, and Supreme Courts are supremely political institutions.The fact that Lady Hale gave Boris Johnson short shrt over proroguing parliament doesnrsquot mean that the Supreme Court is going to be kind to Scottish nationalism. In , the UK Supreme Court dismissed out of hand the Sewel Convention ndash the right of Holyrood to withhold consent to any laws passed by Westminster that cut across the powers of the Scottish parliament. When the chips are down, the UK Supreme Court will always see the integrity of the United Kingdom as its first priority.:Letters: The EU needs to help Spain and Catalonia find peaceThe same goes for Brussels. Ms Sturgeon has condemned the behaviour of the Spanish government, but she should also be making clear her discontent with the EU. Brussels is deeply ambivalent about state repression, whether in France against the Gilet Jaunes, or against the Catalans in Spain. Even when the UK is out of the EU, it is naiumlve to expect that Brussels will necessarily support Scotlandit comes to a constitutional breakdown with Westminster.These are dark times. All the more so because of the double standards of liberal opinion in the UK. We continually hear warnings about impending fascism in Britain. Columnists warn about the threat to democracy from Tommy Robinson, from Boris Johnson, from Brexiters. But here is real fascist repression taking place right now in one of the largest countries in the European Union.Itrsquos time for European governments to condemn this wilful regression to authoritarianism. The Spanish state should be diplomatically shunned by the British Government until it releases these political prisoners, just as countries like Russia are shunned. Madrid must be made to realise that this kind of repression cannot succeed.By reviving the spirit of Franco in st century Europe, Spain has squandered any sympathy for its centralist cause. It is legitimate to argue against Catalan independence it is legitimate to fight elections opposing it. But by breaking heads, dismissing elected governments and then imprisoning peaceful politicians, Madrid has acted in defiance of international law. And it has made the case for Catalan independence unanswerable."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  A chance to make history but the Booker judges blew it","story":"I doubt the Booker organisers are so ecstatic. Since its inception in , the award has only twice before been shared. First was in , when Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton were twinned, and again in , with Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth. After that regrettable outcome, whereby both writersrsquo thunder was stolen, the rules were changed, vetoing this ever happening again.During rsquos final meeting, Florence and his team ndash Liz Calder, Xiaolu Guo, Afua Hirsch and Joanna McGregor ndash were reluctant or unable to make a clear-cut decision. Asking for advice, they were reminded of the rules. Gaby Wood, of the Booker Prize Foundation, reported that, ldquoThey were not so much ided as unwilling to jettison any more when they finally got down to two, and askedthey might split the prize between them. On being told that it was definitively against the rules, the judges held a further discussion and chose to flout them. They left the judging room happy and proud...Should they be proud  I donrsquot think so. That rule was in place to prevent exactly what is already happening. The impact on an author of winning this prestigious title can be dramatic, as last yearrsquos laureate, Anna Burns, made clear in her speech to the literati in Londonrsquos glitzy medieval Guildhall. Gaining the imprimatur of the Booker brings a blaze of international attention, and a Himalayan spike in sales that no sensible novelist would dare dream of, for fear of waking up to the grim reality of meagre royalties that make the living wage look like a Euro Lottery windfall.Margaret Atwood, a previous winner, hinted as much when accepting the accolade. More than anyone, she understands the stakes. This was attention she does not need, her career already illustrious, and she was gracious in acknowledging that. Perhaps she also knows The Testaments isnrsquot in the same class as some of her earlier work. It is not one of the best books Irsquove read this year, although one that is ndash Lucy Ellmannrsquos Ducks, Newburyport, which was shortlisted ndash was a strong contender for first place.Atwood, to my mind, was given her share of the trophy because of the hype around her long-awaited follow-up and its cult following, thanks in large part to the recent television series. But even had it been her finest novel yet, the judges have been cruel to Bernardine Eisto. She is the first black woman to win, a good news story by any standards. That triumph should have been shouted from the rooftops. What a great statement it would have been for her to have been selected, head and shoulders above the rest. Instead, a  that consisted of four women and one man did a disservice to a writer who deserved the full glory, and the full commercial boost, that this distinction brings.The make-up of the judging  is interesting, reflecting the need for greater ersity, and less male dominance, in literary decision-making. And yet this predominantly female group, drawn from a iety of backgrounds and disciplines, blew it. What might have been a historic moment, representing a signicant cultural turning point, has had its impact blunted, its signicance diminished.The reasoning behind this is hard to understand. With five members, it cannot be impossible to have a majority for one particular title. A resolute chair would usually insist on that, gradually eliminating books to reach a single choice. Previous judges have spoken of the angst and turmoil in that final meeting, as the clock ticks down to the ceremony that evening. Last-minute deals are struck, compromises conceded, arguments clinched. For the chair especially, blood pressure mounts at the thought of facing the cameras with a speech when as yet no name has been picked.The reasons for deciding the award on the day of the ceremony are obvious: fear of a leak ruining the live announcement. Yetit is possible to sign waivers in order to get hold of embargoed books ahead of publication, as happened with The Testaments, which was shrouded in Harry Potter-style secrecy, Bookerrsquos organisers can surely bind the judges to keep their choice under wraps overnight. If the final meeting could instead be held without a gun to the head, in itself a form of literary roulette, cooler heads and better counsel would prevail. Perhaps, like a jury in a murder trial, the five could be holed up incommunicado in a hotel until the award night arrives. Better still, they could simply promise to say nothing and then, for the space of  hours, keep their word. How novel would that be What this split decision suggests is that in the judgesrsquo minds, the entire shortlist was worthy of the prize, and they wanted to show as little favouritism as they could. Yet what is the point of a le-changing pound, rewardnot to anoint a standout victor  In effect, this attitude is an echo of the ideology that says we are all successes, and nobody should ever be declared a runner-up or loser in a race or an exam. By insisting on a double honour, ostensibly for big-hearted reasons, the judges have in fact ducked the tough responsibility with which they were charged.Whatever its impact on Atwood and Eisto, this two-hander feels horribly, tediously familiar. Just picture the scene, as the adjudication meeting dragged on for hours. Indecision, a mounting sense of impasse, endless, increasingly feverish discussions, and a leader who could not or would not break the deadlock. After this, a last-ditch soliciting of professional opinion, followed by a flagrant breaking of the rules. In this sense, at least, Booker rsquos unsatisfactory outcome is very much a story of our times."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-scotland---people-government-parliament-disregarded-disrespected-uk-government","story":"And while this article will focus on the risks of a no-deal Brexit, it is important to note that a deal in the terms Boris Johnson proposes would be little better - it would take Scotland out of the EU, single market and customs union against our will.Scotland did not vote for Brexit in  and we rejected it again at the polls in the European Elections this year.The Scottish Parliament voted against the triggering of EU exit negotiations and has consistently opposed a no-deal exit.The Scottish Government has sought to work in good faith with the UK Government, offering compromise solutions as early as December .:No-deal Brexit would risk taking UK to breaking pointAll of this has been ignored.

Boris Johnson is just yet another version.A greater dficulty in accepting Ms Ruddrsquos theory of sexism at work concerns Mrs May herself. Though one could feel sympathy on a purely human level for the pressure she was placed under, her uselessness had nothing to do with her sex. She was a classic case of the wrong person being in a wretchedly demanding job at the worst time.When the history of Brexit comes to be written, there are plenty of women who could be said to have played crucial roles, sexism be damned. Among them are German Chancellor Angela Merkel , Joanna Cherry of the SNP , and Lady Hale, president of the Supreme Court, whose ruling on parliamentary sovereignty will still be quoted generations from now.: Risks of no deal Brexit set outIn any case, Mr Johnsonrsquos chest-beating, deadline waving, and itchy trigger finger has worked against him. He lost his majority and the ticking clock, the very thing Brexiteers told him to deploy in negotiations, has instead been turned in his direction.It is not Emmanuel Macron who said he would rather be ldquodead in a ditch than countenance another extension to a deadline. Michel Barnier has not committed to achieving Brexit by October  ldquocome what may.EvenMr Johnson does scrape a deal in Brussels his problems could be just beginning. Any agreement must be turned into law, and bills can be amended. Now  MPs short of a majority, the Government will be vulnerable at every twist and turn to amendments being proposed and voted on.Maddy Thimont Jack, a senior researcher at the Institute for Government think tank, told the Today programme yesterday that similar pieces of long, complex, EU-related legislation, the Lisbon Treaty and the Maastricht Treaty, had  votes and  votes on them respectively. Plenty of opportunities for ambushes, then.A more immediate concern to those who wish to see a clean exit from the EU is that MPs will support the deal but onlythere is a confirmatory referendum tied to it. Again, this has the potential to lay traps for the future, not least for the SNP and supporters of an indyref in general. There has always been a fundamental flaw with the SNPrsquos support for a second vote on EU membership.If a vote on Brexit can be overturned in just three years, what is to stop the same happening with a vote for Scottish independence Certainly, you could argue that voters in  did not have all the information to hand to make an informed choice, or were straight out lied to, but the same arguments could be deployed in time against a vote for independence.We know work is being done on another blueprint for independence, but times and circumstances change, and I do not recall the claims in the last door-stopper of a White Paper having a long shelf le. All of these caveats would also apply to a vote against independence. Unless, of course, the winning side had to reach a certain percentage, but that, as in , would be controversial.: Nicola Sturgeon addresses conferenceIf it does nothing , the Johnson plan has confirmed that a border is a border, and that they matter. Hard or soft, still a border. In the sea, monitored by technology, checks carried out in remote centres, still a border. Nicola Sturgeon, in acknowledging recently that there could be a hard border between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK, is to be commended for her clarity and honesty. But the First Minister is mistakenshe thinks raising the matter this early on will allow voters to at least become accustomed to the possibility. The very notion of a border is problematic now, and will only become more soit looks like happening.As it might. Brexit has confirmed what was already known about the EU: that it is a formidable opponent when it believes its interests and architecture are being threatened. Much of the EUrsquos approach to Brexit has been about setting an example, pour encourager les autres. Having expended so much time, energy, and money on Brexit, the EU will be in no mood to compromise with any other nation wanting out, or, in the case of a post-Brexit independent Scotland, in. Special treatment would be highly unlikely.Which brings us back to where we came in, with Brexit fatigue. The last three years might have persuaded increasing numbers of Scots that they would be better off out of the UK and in the EU, as a poll at the weekend suggested. Yet how many,it comes to it, will see more years of upheaval as a price worth paying for that  There may not be any choice in the end, but let us not pretend it will be easy, or quick."},{"url":null,"title":"catalan-independence-campaigners-hold-demonstrations-marchers-head-barcelona-ahead-general-strike","story":"Organisers of the protests, the authorities and the jailed independence campaigners alike called for calm after two days of often violent clashes.Thousands joined marches setting off from five towns in Catalonia yesterday en route to the Catalan capital Barcelona, where they are due to arrive on Friday, triggering a planned general strike.Organisers claimed the marches from Girona, Vic, Berga, Tarrega and Tarragona were  kilometers long, and while the size is disputed, the marchers b succeeded in blocking traffic across the region.:Europe must condemn the repression of the CatalansThe marches marked the third day of reactions, both peaceful and violent, to the prison sentences handed down to independence leaders, after they were found guilty of sedition for promoting the failed  secession attempt by Cataloniarsquos regional government.After the announcement on Monday, flights were cancelled and thousands of travellers stranded after protesters attempted to shut down Barcelona Airport.

As someone who had previously attended protests at NATO summits, I was naturally disappointed in the result. Though I do remember the quality of contributions on the conference floor, and I donrsquot believe that the decision made is irreversible. Indeed, while the issue has been off the radar in recent years, it is now vital that it reopens.One contribution in that Perth debate did stick with me. Alyn Smith said that it would be odd for an independent Scotland not to join NATO. That sent a wider signal to the conference. It was an lsquoadults in the roomrsquo type comment. This SNP would be for assimilation into the world system, as a lsquosensiblersquo alternative to challenging the sane, and measured, status quo.Long gone were the days where the SNP would produce leaflets outlining why becoming a member of NATO would be counter-productive to achieving peace and disarmament. Odd, fringe, perhaps romantic in its approach to geopolitics and lacking in pragmatism. That, anyway, is what those who pushed the argument for the SNP to become a pro-NATO organisation, posited.Yet, increasingly, the lsquoadultsrsquo have to come to terms with the reality of a failing world system. The lsquorules-basedrsquo global order was already irrevocably broken when the US invaded Iraq. Since then it has sunk into a deeper morass. And recent events in Northern Syria, with the Turkish invasion and bombing of the Kurds, have shown the bankruptcy of NATO.:Route revealed for Glasgows biggest ever march in support of independenceIt is time to re-open the debate on Scotland and NATO, and SNP members could do worse than seeking to overturn the reversal of their long-held anti-NATO policy led by Angus Robertson seven years ago.Turkey is a member of NATO. As you read this, they are attempting to bomb the Kurds into submission. The Kurds played a critical role in defeating ISIS forces in the region. Approximately -, ISIS militants are held in Kurdish-run prisons.We know Turkey would have preferred the Kurds were defeated, as their long history of oppressing the Kurdish people shows. Trumprsquos betrayal of the Kurds also came alongside a totally  narrative on the defeat of ISIS, which he takes American credit for. In truth, it would not have been possible without Kurdish resistance on the ground.There have been calls for sanctions on Turkey. And there are widespread calls for Turkey to be expelled from NATO. But this is not as simple as it may sound. NATO is not a moral arbiter of global affairs, it is a military alliance, based on competition and war. And it is undemocratic and unaccountable to the populations from which the nations which compose it come from.It is said that the present Turkish aggression is counter to the aims of NATO. In many ways this is true. But since NATO is a block of countries who are interested in the extension of American and European military power in the Middle East and North Africa, Turkey plays a vital strategic role. Which makes the situation complex for NATO.Even after Turkey started bombing Kurds in northern Syria, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stopped short of outright condemnation.Stefano Stefanini, Italyrsquos former permanent representative to NATO, said that the alliance was ldquopowerless in trying to manage Turkeyrsquos action in Syria, without US backing.Yet you will hear some people naively arguing that, should Scotland be a member of NATO, we might somehow add our weight to pull NATO in a more progressive direction. That, however, is a total misunderstanding of what NATO is.Primarily, it is an instrument of US power. It grants the US signicant rights in our own country, including the right to base its military operations here, and that includes nuclear weapons.And letrsquos look specically at Turkey in this context. Turkey is the second largest military in NATO, with the US in first place. It plays a vital strategic role for NATO in opening access to the Middle East via the #ncirlik airbase. Not only that, the base holds approximately  US nuclear bombs. These bombs have been a long-term problem for US strategists and are a hangover from the Cold War. But they remain, and illustrate the problem NATO has with containing Turkey.Because while the relationship is strained, Turkey still provides many strategic options for the West. Little wonder that official spokespeople for NATO are guarded in their criticisms of Erdogan.Indeed, NATO is under stress from Trump too. He is touring around NATO countries demanding more money is poured into the alliance. To repeat, NATO is not a collective security shield as it is often projected, but a combative, military alliance based on building the power and influence of American interests.These then, are the reasons why supporters of Scottish independence must consider the present SNP position on NATO. If we are serious about self-determination, can we really join a nuclear club who seem impotent in the face of the oppression of the Kurds :Former Catalan leader Oriol Junqueras jailed over independence referendumIf we are serious about democracy, can we sign up to a military alliance who will demand increasing pots of money Are we prepared to send Scottish men and women to fight in future conflicts over which we have no oversight, as the global state system teeters on the brink of another financial crisis and as proxy wars turn into regional and international conflicts Surely, the answer is no.

The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has admitted there are “known errors” in the RPI system and last year called for the UK Government to stop issuing bonds linked to it.But that advice has come too late for many local authorities in Scotland which are now shelling out millions more in costs for schools that were built under private finance initiatives.Costs of other Scottish PFI schemes, from prisons to hospitals, have also been rocketing since the deals were agreed.A Scottish Government spokesman said PFI had left “taxpayers in Scotland liable for a £ billion legacy of payments”.He added: “The annual PFI repayment bill now exceeds £ billion – nearly five times more than the Non-Profit Distributingprogramme which we introduced and is proving far better value to the public purse.“The funding of public infrastructure has vastly improved since . “We are working to ensure PFI contracts which have been inherited provide the best value for money for the taxpayer – and to ensure savings are achieved from existing contracts, wherever possible.”The Scottish Government is understood to be eyeing a model of public-private partnerships pioneered by the Welsh Government.Like PFI, the so-called Mutual Investment Model sees private partners build and maintain public assets for a fee.But the deals do not include services like cleaning, which have proved costly through PFI. The model also involves the public sector as a minority co-investor, taking a share of the profits.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Figures published by Facebook show that #. million was spent on political ads on Facebook or sister site Instagram.\"  Thousands spent on targeted Facebook adverts by Scottish politicians viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has pledged to ban any further public-private finance dealshis party takes power.“Scotland’s historical PFI deals have put unnecessary pressure on our NHS, our local government services and right across the public sector,” he said.“That is why I have been clear that the Scottish Labour government that I lead will introduce a ban on new PFI PPP NPD deals.“We will also take private contracts back in-house at the earliest opportunity to save the taxpayer money in the long term.”The JPI Media investigations team has been looking into PFI contracts across the UK.According to figures obtained from hundreds of public bodies, rocketing inflation and extra costs are set to add at least £ billion to the overall price tag of PFI schemes.Among its findings, the team found that:• An NHS maternity unit built and run by a private company was closed after just  years but is still costing the taxpayer millions of pounds• A police force is trying to think up new uses for a mothballed custody suite it is still paying for• Expensive maintenance contracts have seen one police force billed £ for an extra chair.Trade union leaders have called for urgent action.Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said the escalating costs of PFI were a “national scandal”.She said: “The money that has poured into the pockets of profit-hungry financial institutions and private companies could have been much better spent directly on public service projects and infrastructure. “PFIs are a rip-roaring example of out-of-control ‘bandit capitalism’.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amTwo young, talented Orcadian weightlters will turn out for Scotland after receiving call-ups by their country.

As is tradition, an ensign, which has been tied to the wreck of the battleship was presented to a family member of one of the crewmen.

People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling.The scheme is expected to increase recycling of single-use bottles and cans and cut CO emissions, playing an important role in tackling the climate emergency. It will also give people an extra incentive not to litter.Zero Waste Scotland, who helped the Scottish Government design the scheme, is especially interested to hear from islands-based drinks producers, retailers, hospitality businesses, and other key stakeholders, such as tourism businesses.The draft regulations laid before the Scottish Parliament in September include a target of capturing  per cent of all scheme containers. Achieving that requires making the scheme accessible and practical for everyone in Scotland.In addition to this and six other island engagement events, the Scottish Government will complete an Islands Impact Assessment to ensure that any signicant unique impacts on island communities are captured and mitigated against. A webinar will be held after the final event to give people that could not attend a chance to learn more about the scheme.Jill Farrell, chief operating officer, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “We want to make sure that Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme works for the whole of Scotland. That’s why we are visiting Orkney to speak with residents, businesses and stakeholders. We want to benefit from their insight into how this will work for the islands.“Making the scheme a success in Orkney will require dferent approaches from in Scotland’s cities. From logistics and transport, to cash flow and tourism, we look forward to discussing how we can work together to deliver a world-class scheme.”Alastair Nicolson, programme manager at Highlands  Islands Enterprise, said: “This is a very ambitious scheme that aims to make a real dference to people and communities in every part of Scotland.“For the scheme to work effectively, dferent approaches will need to be worked out and applied. Models of recycling that work well in large towns and cities won’t necessarily bring about the desired results in rural areas, including islands and remote mainland communities.“It’s great that the needs of islanders are being recognised at this early stage of the Deposit Return Scheme through this programme of events on the ground and online.”The Orkney engagement event will take place at The Orkney Hotel, Kirkwall, on Thursday October , from am to pm.To sign up to take part, visit http:bit.ly DepositReturnOrkneyA webinar will be hosted by Zero Waste Scotland following its series of island engagement events.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It can reduce your risk of heart disease, stroke, type  diabetes and cancer by up to  per cent. And it can reduce your risk of dying early by as much as  per cent. This form of treatment is free and pretty much anyone can do it.“This is no snake oil,” says the NHS website. “Whatever your age, there’s strong scientic evidence that [it] can help you lead a healthier and happier le.” You may have already guessed what it is, but now there is even further support for the idea that exercise has a hugely beneficial effect on human health.: Edinburgh citizens part of project to implement ‘exercise prescription’ for cancer patients: Exercise is not just for the obese - Sir Harry BurnsA global  of experts, after reviewing evidence of its benefits for people with cancer, called for the systematic use of an “exercise prescription” to help patients cope with the side-effects of treatment and improve survival rates.Edinburgh cancer patient Gary MacDougall spoke how exercise had helped him “mentally to take a break from the worry” and that during his first six chemotherapy sessions he had actually become “stronger and fitter”.Age no barrierHuman beings are designed to be physically active. Modern lestyles, which mean many people can remain seated for much of the day, whether they are in the car or on the bus to work, typing at a computer in an office or watching television at home, are unnatural in the extreme.But as well as creating a largely sedentary world, we also seem to have convinced ourselves that exercise is something people only do when they are young. This is simply not true. One of the most transformative steps that could be taken would be to turn Scotland into a ‘sporting nation’, one in which everyone has a sport throughout their le.This could be something as simple as walking. Anyone can go for a walk, but perhaps walking clubs would help us do it on a more regular basis. It could be something a bit more exciting, like walking football, for example, or a bit more strenuous like badminton, hillwalking, rugby or long-distance running. In addition to its effects on health, exercise also appears to have a positive effect on our mood and mental well-being. Setting up a host of new sports clubs would take a considerable amount of organising but wouldn’t necessarily need to cost an inordinate amount of money.

The RNLI relies on donations to provide this training, to ensure that our leboat crew is as well prepared as they can be to help save lives at sea.”.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsay man gets new role at lerwick harbour ","story":"Capt Arthur was recruited to succeed Alexander Simpson who was recently promoted to harbourmaster.Deputy harbourmaster Captain Neil Arthur.Port authority chief executive Calum Grains said: #We are delighted to welcome Neil and the contribution he will make to our operations across the ious industry sectors.#Capt Arthur began his career as a cadet with Clyde Marine in , with sponsorship from the specialist geared cargo company Gearbulk.He later gained a BSc in Nautical Science from Strathclyde University and qualied as an officer from Glasgow College of Nautical Studies.Following employment by Gearbulk as a junior officer, he moved into the offshore industry with Subsea  for  years, rising through the ranks and gaining his chief officer#s licence from Glasgow College of Nautical Studies and master#s from Glasgow Maritime Academy..."},{"url":null,"title":"shetland among most vulnerable to brexit says msp todd ","story":"The SNP member has demanded that Brexit is halted and claims half of Shetlanders live in vulnerable communities.Maree ToddMs Todd is basing that on Scottish government analysis which led to the publication of #The Local Level Brexit Vulnerabilities in Scotland Report# this week. It states that rural and remote areas, especially those in The Highlands and Islands, have signicant populations at risk from the fallout of leaving the EU – with or without a trade deal.The report considers community access to services, working-age population, income deprivation, workers in #Brexit-sensitive# industries, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.Highlands and Islands representative Ms Todd said: “We always knew that Brexit would be damaging to Scotland but this new analysis really hits home the devastating impact that Brexit will have here in the Shetland Islands.“Families across Shetland will feel the impact of Brexit, with up to  per cent of the local population most vulnerable to the potential economic shock.“The SNP government will continue to do what it can to mitigate and minimise the impact on our most vulnerable communities, but this study lays bare the recklessness of the Tories in their blind determination to pursue Brexit at any cost.“Scotland never voted for Brexit and certainly not for the reckless extreme version now pursued by the UK government. It’s essential that we stop Brexit and go back to the people.”Ms Todd added that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , also published this week, #found the UK is already £ billion worse off as a result of Brexit before we have even left the EU – with the UK economy .- per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been.#Over a million voters in Scotland voted for BREXIT, % of Shetlanders voted to leave, are their votes to be ignored  As a UNITED Kingdom we operate as a single unit well we did during two world wars. I find that Maree Todd’s concern about the potential economic effect that BREXIT could have upon Shetlanda bit of a cheek, coming from a party that currently has chalked up a deficit of £ billion for Scotland, due to irresponsible spending policies.Brexit, is nothing more than for the Tories to distance themselves from the EU, and to have a trade deal with the USA, and the, most likely, mass privatisation of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to US companies, where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It is so typical of the Tories to put themselves first regardless to the devastating consequences of their policies and selfish agenda#s onto the people of the UK, especially those in society who struggle as it is. It will be a society of those who have and those who do not have. Where profit is the dominating principle which governs and controls those in power. Brexit, will make the UK, very much an unfair, unjust society for the majority of people. It will also have a great impact on smaller communities where the work-force is from the EU, and the economic circumstances putting many jobs and businesses at risk.Brexit, in all its forms, will cause more harm than good####not to mention poking the fires of xenophobia and racism in its wake.If Shetland is #among the most vulnerable to Brexit#, then presumably, it will also be #among the most vulnerable to Scexit# as we are guaranteed to be out of the EU with No Deal, should the SNP#s policy of Scottish independence ever become reality Tulloch undermines himself. As a UNITED Europe we acted as a single unit. Why should leaving one Union be better than leaving the other  He should reflect on the plain fact that it isn’t our European neighbours that are demanding we split from England against our stated will.“Take back control” my rear end.Peter Hamilton, we agree at last. You, at last, you admit to talking from your rear end!! Now it all makes sense.No Peter, it is the Tories. As I have previously mentioned, their agenda is nothing more than to privatise and hand control of the UK#s Health Care and and other Infrastructure to US companies, where the Tories will benefit mostly. The cost of living under Brexit, will most certainly increase, and the people most affected by it will struggle even more.The Tories, as they have always done, have only thought of themselvesand what they can gain regardless to the damaging consequences upon everybody  in society.Their policies and political motives are highly isive, and generally do more harm than good to society as a whole.Bad enough we have London Europe bleating how they will sufferwe leave EU, when frankly none of them venture beyond the M wall to see England. I would be an idiotI didn#t think we will not suffer first but most of the problems stem from weak MPs and woeful spending.Perhaps the turning point was Thatcher and the Poll Tax. The capture of the Conservative and Unionist Party, one nation and pragmatic until then, by monetarist, neo-liberal ideologues is now all but complete. They just don’t make Tories like they used to.

By Alistair Carmichael‘s lack of understanding on why this piece of legislation has been put forward. The United Kingdom is one of the few countries in Europe, and in fact the world,that doesn’t require some form of identication when an election is taking place. However, in light of massive electoral fraud in the West Midlands and the South East of England, particularly in local government elections, the current administration has decided to tighten up the rules it is long overdue. Germany, France, Sweden, the Netherlands and Greece all require either a national ID card or a utility bill or bank statement as proof of residency which, especially in the case of Greece, have been necessary. Australia and Israel, and certain states within America have also tightened up the rules due to similar issues with fraud. None of the above measures have prevented honest citizens from exercising their democratic rights.The UK remains a country with low levels of voter fraud and the majority of the recent alleged voter fraud in the Midlands related to postal and proxy votes which voter ID at the ballot box will do nothing to solve.Carmichael an obstacle to democracy , says Anderson.#The government have sat on their hands in the face of the actual threats to electoral integrity: anonymous ‘dark ads’, dodgy donations and disinformation.

Since , Friends of Glassmullin Open Greenhave campaigned against the facility, which is funded by Education NI for De La Salle College.In recent days, however, through consultation and engagement, the school and local community representatives have reached an agreement that will pave the way for the new G pitch. Amongst the terms of the agreement is a commitment that there will be no floodlights and a fence will not exceed . metres at the facility.The resolution will further ensure that there will be no infrastructure put in place for the installation of floodlights at a later date.A seven-person committee made up of school representatives, residents, and an independent chair will now be appointed to manage the facility.Local residents, Martin Derby and Anthony Marron, commented: “We have agreed, in good faith, a pathway to allow for the construction of the De La Salle Sports Facility to commence. Recently we have been part of positive and open discussions with the college and the outcome is a cohesive proposal that benefits all parties involved. This proposal has now been accepted and we will work closely together through a newly formed committee for the project delivery. We will continue to act with the community and our young people at heart throughout the forthcoming process.”Claire White, Principal De La Salle College, said: #The school is delighted to have worked in partnership with local residents to reach a mutual agreement thus allowing for the construction of the sports facility to begin. The facility will provide much needed sports amenities for the pupils of De La Salle College as well as for young people within the community. We are excited to see the project come to fruition and are looking forward to participating and working with the newly formed committee to ensure community cohesion.#Construction of the facility is due to start imminently partnered with ongoing engagement across residents and interest groups via the newly formed joint committee."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"decision due on casement in month","story":"WEST Belfast MP Paul Maskey has said that a decision on the planning application for the redevelopment of Casement Park could be reached in the next month.The £ million redevelopment plans had previously faced setbacks due to safety concerns linked to the size of the stadium.Planning permission was granted for a , capacity stadium in , but in  approval was quashed in a High Court legal challenge brought by Mooreland # Owenragh Residents’ Association .New plans to build a , capacity Casement Park were submitted by Ulster GAA in February .Mr Maskey, who recently met with planners at the Department for Infrastructure , said that, while some information regarding the decision was still outstanding, a decision on the application is imminent.“The department are still waiting on some information coming back to them from DFI roads,” he said.“Obviously when they get that back they’ll have to go through that with due diligence.“When they get that information, which should be within the next month, then hopefully they will be able to make a decision. I hope that they will make that decision as soon as possible.“There have been other large-scale applications that have been submitted after Casement Park, which have already been decided. So once they get that information from DfI Road they should make that decision without delay.”Meanwhile MORA has written to the DfI Planning to object to the new stadium proposals.The letter, which has been seen by the Andersonstown News, states that “Further Environemtal Information” provided by Ulster GAA in July “fails to allay” concerns about development of the stadium “to an oversized capacity”.The residents’ association insists that the redevelopment would have “unacceptable impacts” on people in the area including “excessive over-shadowing and loss of daylight”, air pollution, as well as “noise, disturbance and safety issues” should proposals for three major concerts a year at the stadium be given the green light.“In addition, the applicant has been unable to demonstrate that the road network can safely handle the extra vehicular traffic that would be generated by sporting and concert events,” the letter reads.“The applicant’s proposals for safe evacuation, which now extend to the Stockmans Lane roundabout, also give rise to serious concern and demand for more rigorous scrutiny.”A spokesperson for Ulster GAA said: “Within its planning application, including its Further Environmental Information submission, Ulster GAA has comprehensively addressed all factors relating to the stadium’s operations and impact, with the Safety Technical Group having unanimously supported the project plans.“As the stadium plans are currently under consideration by the Department for Infrastructure it would be inappropriate to comment further on the live planning application.”The Safety Technical Group comprises representatives from Sport NI Belfast City Council, the PSNI, the NI Ambulance Service the NI Fire and Rescue Service Sports Grounds Safety Authority and the GAA’s ground safety management."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shirleyvalentine-digitalad-anderstown.png","title":"playboy as relevant today as it ever was","story":"One of the most iconic plays of Irish theatre has been reimagined for our times and received a standing ovation at the Lyric Theatre during its opening night.Running until November , JM Synge’s The Playboy of the Western World tells the story of Pegeen Mikewho is tired of her le, working in her father’s pub in a small village in rural Ireland, where she isbetrothed to the dull Shawn Keogh, only for stranger Christy Mahonto walk into her le with a story that sets the whole village talking.While all the women in the village have their heads turned by Christy, whose dark secret makes him all the more attractive, the playboy’s past threatens to catch up with him and it surely does.First performed in , the play is as fresh today as it was when it caused riots in Dublin on its opening night.

But Aidan was intrigued by the natural world – just like so many youngsters today – and when he was  his le changed forever when a simple thing happened – his father bought him a pair of binoculars so he could better study the birds he spent so much time watching in the gardens of Riverdale.Those old second-hand binoculars were the catalyst that propelled him on a le journey that culminated this week in the opening of an Eco Wildle Garden at St Michael’s Nursery School in Andersonstown.The garden was a labour of love for Aidan and fellow wildle crusader Debbie ‘Doolittle’ Nelson. Their plan to build a nature haven for kids – rather than a common play park – got the full backing of the school. Principal Clare McAllister said the children now choose themselves to go outdoors every day.“They just love to be outside in the middle of nature – so many children don’t get the opportunity to getoutside. And I think this park will encourage children and parents to use our parks and public amenities more,” she said. Board of Governors chairperson Sean Óg McGuinness said that even bad weather doesn’t deter the kids. “They just put on their wet gear and can’t wait to get out to play. It’s a nature paradise.”Aidan and Debbie spent months designing and perfecting the garden – Debbie herself did all the joinery work, making the  bird boxes, as well as hedgehog havens in each corner and a wildle pond.“I planted giant water lilies for dragonflies to rest on, and just as I was putting them in during the summer a dragonfly flew by,” said Debbie. “So even though we’re in the heart of West Belfast there are still some rarities about here.”Debbie even managed to allow pathways for hedgehogs to the fenced-off pond by cutting mini-archways into the fence. “The pond itself has wee ramps so frogs and newts and hedgehogs can safely visit it,” she said.And the nestboxes aren’t just to attract garden birds – one at the front of the school has been designed for kestrels. Aidan said: “You can just imagine the faces of the kidsa pair of kestrels take up residence here. It would be fantastic.”In fact the boxes are designed to provide homes for seven other species – including swts, robins, house sparrows, treecreepers and bats. The children’s eco garden – behind the school beside St Michael’s church – is sheltered by giant trees including oaks that long predate the school – “it could be one of the oldest oak trees in West Belfast,” said Aidan.He added: “We need to be teaching young ones, today, at home, in school and crucially in the nursery – the formative years – how to appreciate and look after wildle, the pollinators, birds, bats, hedgehogs, vegetables, amphibians, orchards and ultimately ourselves so to be best placed in years to come to deal with all the many complex survival challenges ahead for people and bioersity.” Things were so dferent when Aidan was young. The binoculars which helped instil a love of nature unfortunately didn’t last long. British soldiers based in nearby Casement noticed them being used at an upstairs window and thought they were being spied on. They raided his house, running up the stairs to find Aidan birdwatching from his bedroom.The soldiers confiscated the binoculars. “The gave me a wee ticket, and said I could collect them when the Troubles were over,” Aidan said this week. “I never imagined that would be  years later!” Aidan never got his hands on those binoculars again, but he attributes that short time spent with that special gt from his father to his lelong love of nature. Five years later, his father was killed by a British army Saracen in a crash on the Falls Road.“Those binoculars launched me on the journey that I’m still enjoying. And I hope this eco garden will have the same effect by inspiring the next generation of youngsters,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"dup held series of meetings with loyalists to discuss eu exit specifics","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The warning led to calls for greater engagement with the loyalist community.In a series of tweets yesterday, journalist Brian Rowan alleged that Mrs Foster, along with other senior DUP colleagues, met with Jimmy Birch, Jackie McDonald and Matt Kincaid, who have previously been named as senior UDA figures.At a separate meeting, organised through the auspices of the Action for Community Transformation project, Mr Rowan stated that alleged senior UVF members Winston Irvine and Harry Stockman were present.Read MoreDUP defends its position as rivals claim it’s been ‘suckered’ in Brexit talksThe former BBC NI security editor said it was his view that it was important that loyalists are \"involved included in legacy and other dialogues, including Brexit\". A loyalist source told the journalist: \"Whatever is going to happen, they [the DUP] need to answer the questions before they are asked. Is it a good deal  Is it a bad deal  Is it the only deal \"The source continued: \"If Sinn Fein thinks its all right [any Brexit deal] loyalists will think its all wrong.\"Mr Rowan also tweeted that he was told that loyalists are exploring ways for their concerns to be heard outside Northern Ireland and that a \"mechanism means\" to achieve this is currently being explored. According to the Sunday Times, sources within the UVF have said it is planning to organise demonstrations and protests using proxy groupsthe government attempts a Brexit compromise by aligning Northern Ireland and the Republic in any customs arrangement.A DUP spokesperson said: \"The Party engages with a range of stakeholders about a range of matters on an ongoing basis in the interests of moving Northern Ireland forward.\"Meanwhile, the UDA in west Belfast were said to be adopting a \"wait and see\" approach until the specics of any Brexit deal are announced.In response, the Ulster Unionist MLA Doug Beattie had said he believes that the loyalist community has not been engaged with enough on Brexit issues.Commenting on the alleged meetings between the loyalist representatives and the DUP, loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson said there was \"nothing controversial\" about the largest unionist party engaging with a \"signicant section\" of the unionist and loyalist community.\"I dont think theres anything overly signicant about that however, I do think the DUP should be listening to the voices of the grassroots in the unionist and loyalist community,\" he added. \"I do think in the past number of days we have certainly seen a change from the DUPs position last week where they were ultimately almost signing up for an economic united Ireland. I wasnt present at any of these meetings.

Read MoreBrexit talks to resume on final day before crunch EU summitWatch: From Derry to Donegal, what Brexit could mean for a border community Dr Esmond Birnie, senior economist at Ulster University, has estimated the potential upfront duty costs on goods moving from Great Britain into Northern Ireland could be £m a year.Appearing before the Brexit Committee in Westminster yesterday, Dr Birnie said: \"Businesses would be up-front out of pocket, as it were, for a considerable sum of money.\"Then there would be a degree of administrative burden on their part to retrieve that money.\"We all know the dficulties which the business community have faced in terms of the apprenticeship levy, a system whereby most businesses pay into a pot and then,they can, are required to draw back.\"The business community, both in Northern Ireland and here in Great Britain, have been extremely unhappy about how that has worked.\"I would envisage similar problems in a tarf rebate-type system. It would be fiendishly dficult to administer.\"There would be a costin terms of setting it up and a cost to business in terms of their cashflow.\"Roger Pollen, from the Federation of Small Businesses Northern Ireland , told MPs that the system could potentially workthere was no movement of money required and the tarf and rebate cancelled themselves out in one transaction.\"If that was a process that could be done in a simple transaction that would show tarf paid and tarf due to be reclaimed, and you would complete the transaction so there was no actual movement of money, just reconciliation, then people manageable,\" he said.\"It comes down to level of detail. What will actually be behind that sort of transaction  If it is as seamless as that, then it is something people will deal with and take in their stride.\"Meanwhile, Ivor Ferguson, president of the Ulster Farmers Union, told the committee that livelihoods would be ruinedthere was not an \"orderly and managed\" EU exit.Mr Ferguson painted a bleak picture when asked what the consequences of a no-deal would be for his industry.\"Right from the word go, we realised that a no-deal would be catastrophic for our farming members,\" he told MPs.\"It would be catastrophic across all sectors of farming and, indeed, for the agri-food business in general. Of course, the agri-food business and farming is the biggest sector in Northern Ireland, so it would have a detrimental effect even on the Northern Ireland economy.\"He said the potential for signicant tarfs on goods moving into the Republic of Ireland was the most concerning threat, highlighting that % of milk and % of lambs produced in Northern Ireland go south.\"What would it mean for us  It would mean market failure and it would mean bankruptcy for a fair percentage of farmers,\" Mr Ferguson said of a no-deal.\"Obviously, you can understand it is a place that we just dont want to go.\"PSNI Assistant Chief Constable George Clarke warned that while the dissident threat had been severe for a decade, there could be a potential further upsurge after Brexit.He said the UKs exit from the EU could serve as a \"clarion call\" for the violent extremists. \"They have a potential to rally,\" he said. \"There is a potential for opportunities to exist for them to carry out their terrorist crimes and activities depending on whatinfrastructure, for example, would look like.\""},{"url":null,"title":"historic georgian home in co tyrone goes on the market","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The popular presenter has a close affinity to the Down side, having been brought up in Burren, and will bring plenty of fun and laughter to the proceedings.Louise Kearney, part of the organising committee, said excitement is building in the area on the countdown to the historic night in the club on Saturday, October .She added: ldquoWe are delighted the Down legends are coming to spend a special evening in our clubrooms. It will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with All-Ireland winners. We are very proud to have two Loughinisland men who gave so much to the county, and continue to give so much to our club and community.Itrsquos a night not to be missed as this is a landmark year for the Down side who created history when they brought Sam Maguire across the border for the fth time.Louise said: ldquoIt may be one of the last times the squad will be together in a club in this capacity for a number of years and we are grateful they are spending that time with us. We will have a relaxed but enthralling evening as we look back at the glory days.While the spotlight will be on the Down legends, families from the Loughinisland Justice Group will be special guests at the event and their loved ones will be remembered during the night.Louise added: ldquoWe will also take time to remember that  was such a dficult year for Loughinisland. A quarter of a century on from the massacre, we will think back on the impact of the Down win on the community, the uplt that the team brought and the footballing spirit which helped people through the darkest days. We have a lot of stories to hear.The organisers have secured the Sam Maguire and Anglo-Celt cups for the event so there will be opportunities on the night to get photographs taken alongside the Down greats and the legendary silverware.Former Down and Loughinisland player Alan Molloy, who is also one of the organisers, said it was a remarkable feat that a small rural club like Loughinisland had three medals from the great teams of the s and their achievements had brought much joy and prestige to the club.He added: ldquoThis will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with these All-Ireland winners, including Loughinisland men Gary Mason and Gerard Colgan, who gave so much to the county and continue to give so much to our club and community.ldquoGary Mason is the proud owner of two medals, from the victories in  and . Whilst Gerard Colgan was playing for An Riocht in , he spent the last of his playing days with Loughinisland. Both players are now passing on their valuable knowledge to the future generations through coaching our underage teams.ldquoThe club is very grateful that so many legends of the  team are ing to spend this evening with us. This will be a relaxed evening where we can sit back and listen to the enthralling stories from those glory days.The event will be sponsored by The Irish News and the organising committee would like to thank them for their support and backing.Tickets can be purchased in OrsquoToolersquos bar, Loughinisland GAC clubrooms, or by contacting the clubrsquos Facebook page, email loughinislandgac@gmail, or calling  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Armstrong.jpg","title":"Armstrong takes second at Lurgan  ","story":"THE first round of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross League, hosted by Apollo CC at Lurgan Park, took place on Sunday.It was certainly a testing time for the course setters. There was a clearly much debate from the competitors about how muddy it was going to be andthey would have enough wet weather gear.As it turned out, the sun would appear and the rain would disappear leaving Lurgan Park looking beautully tranquil.The first race up was the U- race with Fiadh Kellett, Hugh and Conor Hetherington flying the flag for Dromara CC and more importantly loving the mud. Great to see them enjoying it.The U-s boysrsquo race saw young Oscar McBride loving the mud as he battled through the crown to claim eighth place in a competitive race.Aoe Kellett was in a tough U- girlsrsquo race that saw her put in a tremendous effort to claim third place with second place not far away. A great start to her league campaign and pressure on dad to produce in his race.James Armstrong has had a great summer of cycling and has taken this rich vein of form into the cyclo-cross. Curtis McKee, from Maryland Wheelers, would keep James from the top spot of the podium, but only by a mere six seconds.With junior members having set the scene at the cyclocross it was time for the senior team to get on their bikes.In the MTB Support race Mick Foley, fresh back from injury and claiming to be unfit, tore through the mud to claim a top  finish leaving expectations that he can only get better and better.The club had a large representation in the B race which saw  riders competing.It didnrsquot last long for Gibson Chambers as he got caught up in a crash at the start.This left Paul Hamilton taking the honour of first Dromara man home in sixth place, not far behind was Richard Cowan in eighth, Brian Kellett managed to take th and hold off Darren McCann, just.Adi Booth took the bragging rights as he finished ahead of Bryce Hetherington and Mike Barton finishing st, rd and th respectively.

We believe he is still finding out the additional things he can do with his new hand and therersquos still improvements ahead.Mr Moore said Alfie learnt to write with his left hand and still does but there is hope that over time, that he might be able to write and use his prosthesis hand for everything he normally does with his left hand.He says that Alfiersquos classmates and other pupils have accepted the new addition to the P pupil very well.Mr Moore added: ldquoWersquore never have had any problems with other children understanding about Alfie.

It is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Council officials insist that the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and while they concede that preserving the building will be a challenge, it is also presents an opportunity to something exciting with it.The heritage value of the site, which extends as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue, is something council officials are not only keen to preserve, but build upon as they work with the Department for Communities to maximise the potential of the site.The government department, which has already acquired the former PSNI base, is working in partnership with the local authority to help bring new investment to Downpatrick town centre.Leading brands such as Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains, along with several other big names, are keen to invest in Downpatrick, but at present cannot identy suitable accommodation to meet their respective needs.Those behind the Irish Street plan hope that a redevelopment scheme can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses which have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for many years.Councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed confirmation that work on the development brief could be completed shortly.He believes that the transformation of the former police base and adjacent land can provide Downpatrick with a signicant economic boost, creating new retail space and much-needed jobs.Cllr Curran reiterated the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town.He said many will be looking forward to seeing the detail of the development brief and the potential options for a hugely important development site in the heart of Downpatrick.ldquoThere has been no signicant retail investment in the town for quite some time. The Irish Street proposal has the potential to transform the town centre, providing additional business for existing traders, Cllr Curran added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 By.jpg","title":"By George he’s got it as Bright come good  ","story":"THE long wait is over. Bright finally got their hands on the JFC trophy after a pulsating victory over Aughlisnafin at Pairc Esler on Sunday.Despite having lost the previous six finals they have appeared in, the Ballynoe-based club went into the clash full of confidence and it showed as they broke Aughlisnafinrsquos hearts with an expansive display.The game ebbed and flowed throughout with fortune favouring the brave.Aughlisnafin seized the early initiative before the departure of Mark Stratton to a straight red card threatened to derail their challenge.However, Bright were unable to take real advantage and just when they made their move, Seamas Tumelty joined Stratton for an early shower.The game opened up at this stage with Bright showing a greater composure to prevent Aughlisnafin from completing the double in a thrilling finale to the game.Oran Flanagan and Cailean Toner exchanged early scores in a positive opening to the game before a long range point from the impressive Adam Garland and a good effort from Shane McCann sent the lsquoFin into a - to - lead by the sixth minute.The action was hot and heavy all over the park, but Stratton saw red in the th minute and Bright took full advantage.Sam Dinu reduced the deficit to a single point before the accurate Flanagan converted a free to restore the lsquoFinrsquos two-point lead.Dinu and Breannain McComiskey swapped scores before two Flanagan frees stretched Aughlisnafinrsquos lead to four points, despite being down to  men.Kyran Smythrsquos side held on grimly to the lsquoFinrsquos coat tails and just before the break Gareth George helped breathe new le into Brightrsquos challenge when he pointed from a rsquo to leave his side trailing - to - at half-time.The second half was in its infancy when Bright lay down their marker.A blistering spell of attacking football yielded unanswered points from Declan Trainor, Kevin Groves and the ubiquitous George to draw level.There was only one team in it at this stage, but Bright went and shot themselves in the foot when Tumelty fell foul of the referee and was shown the red card.Brightrsquos heads were now down and Flanagan punished the indiscretion when he pointed the lsquoFin into a - to - lead after  minutes.Smyth sent for the cavalry at this stage and it duly arrived in the shape of Matt McKiernan.The rangy forward was on hand to steer the ball past Calum Croskery and when Toner quickly tagged on a point, Bright suddenly and from nowhere, were three points clear, - to -.Driven on remorselessly by Donagh Steele, Aughlisnafin battled back and points from Sean Fitzsimmons and two from Flanagan had it all square again with  minutes gone.The game was still being played at a hectic pace and with  minutes gone, Garland pointed the lsquoFin into a deserved, but precarious - to - lead.Dinu held his nerve to level matters, but Aughlisnafin went back in front thanks to a point from Shea Croskery. Corey Ranaghan quickly levelled matters, but that man Croskery gave his side a - to - lead with less than eight minutes remaining.Fingernails were being bitten to the quick as Bright went in search of the equaliser and it arrived less than a minute later via a Kevin Groves free.It was now a case of who dares wins as the game hurtled to a conclusion and points from George, Dinu and Matthew Burns had Bright literally home and hosed.Aughlisnafin refused to capitulate and they knew that only a goal would do, but all they could muster in added time was a point from Flanagan as Bright held on for an historic win.Bright: Michael Farrand, Barry Mageean, Marc Burke, Seamas Tumelty, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Nicholas OrsquoConnor, Jack McLaughlin, Corey Ranaghan , Cailean Toner , Sam Dinu , Kevin Groves , Declan Trainor , Owen McEvoy, Gareth George , Rian Tempany.

The exercise is expected to take around  months to complete.Council officials will examine each community centre in detail with the exercise looking at the population they serve, the number of young people in their area, crime statistics andthe facilities are located in so-called neighbourhood renewal areas.One area the review will examine will be Crossgar where local people are keen to see new community centre provided.A major feasibility study was carried out a number of years ago with a site adjacent to St Colmcillersquos High School in the village identied as the preferred location for a new community and sports centre. While a new facility was never constructed, the forthcoming review will examinethe need for it remains.The idea of the community centre probe is to determine potential under provision and where new facilities may be required moving forward.Council officials will also look to seethere is over provision in any areas but insist there are no plans to close any existing centres. They argue that the main driver is about increasing and improving community provision across the district.While itrsquos still early days, council officials say they will work through the process over the next year and will keep ratepayers fully informed about consultation meetings which will be held across all seven district electoral areas to ensure everyone has an opportunity to have their say.Described as a ldquosignicant piece of work, the review will also include discussions with community groups and associations.Insisting that the review is not about closing community centres, council officials say the examination of current provision will focus on where they are located and local need. And they have suggested that the exercise could potentially throw up issues which surfaced during the playground strategy which resulted in some play parks amalgamating.Council officials say while the intention is not to close any centres at this stage, the review will focus on potential gaps in current provision to help form strategic decisions about where to build new centresthis is required.The review will also examine which community centres may require refurbishment and potential extensions to allow them to meet increasing demand.Council officials have confirmed that a number of the districtrsquos community centres are part-funded by the Department for Communities with a number also run by local groups and associations.Ahead of the community centre review, council officials have been conducting an exercise looking at the user figures and the number of programmes that the respective centres deliver. Part of the forthcoming review will also take a critical look at funding streams to help increase centre usage.Council officials say the parks and open spaces strategy will identy those that need upgraded and those which are not necessarily adding any value. It will examine those that can be improved with the review rolled out over the next  months.When the community centre and parks and open spaces review has been completed, initial reports will be debated by the local authorityrsquos Active and Health Communities Committee which will then make recommendations to the full councilto agree a new strategy moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C October 9%2C 1979  ","story":"STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash Police have still not recovered the body of the second man drowned on a fishing trip to Strangford Lough at the weekend.At Downpatrick police station mdash from where the search operation was co-ordinated mdash police say there is no hope that  year-old Carrickfergus man, Mr John Craig, is still alive.They believe that Mr Craigrsquos body has been swept out into the Irish Sea and search has now been stretched to the Isle of Man.Mr Craig went in a -foot fibre glass cabin cruiser to fish for mackerel bait on Saturday afternoon, along with with Peter Johnson , from Woodcroft Rise, Braniel, Belfast.In the early hours of Sunday morning police were alerted by the relatives of the two men, anxious that neither had ed.

I am now glad to put the record straight after all these years.The sides have met twice in the league this season, drawing - to - at Pairc Eoghan Rua and Kilcoo won thegame in Warrenpoint - to -.The mood music in Kilcoo this season has been good.Their - to - win over Clonduff in the league last Wednesday night clinched the ACFL Division  crown, last lted by Mickey Morans side in  and they are even more intent on adding the Frank OHare Cup on Sunday.Losing out to Burren in last years decider was a big blow to Kilcoo, but they have put that reversal behind them with the exact same squad of players.What you see with Kilcoo is what you get.They have a unique work ethic and everything revolves around the team as a unit. No one player has a bigger or more important job than anyone .They are in this together and they have an unfaltering belief in their own ability and work on the motto thatyou fail to prepare, prepare to fail.Martin McCourt has dislodged the experienced Niall Kane in goal for the last few games and could well hold on to the number one spot for the final.One thing for certain, bar injury, is that the five Branagan brothers will start, four in defence, with Eugene lining out at corner forward, but given a licence to roam.They epitomise everything good about Kilcoo. Honest, resolute, determined and committed.Ryan McEvoy, Dylan Ward and Aaron Morgan should be tasked with winning the ball in the middle of the park and supplying Paul Devlin, Conor Laverty and the Johnston brothers Ryan and Jerome mdash not forgetting younger brother Shealan when he is called upon.Kilcoo also have serious strength on the bench and in addition to Johnston the younger, they can call on Anthony Morgan, Paddy Devlin, Sean OHanlon, James McClean and Felim McGreevy,.Warrenpoint have made their way through some tricky ties unbeaten and along the way have accounted for An Riocht , Ballyholland , Longstoneand Ballyholland in the semi-final, - to -.Manager Niall McAleenan has the nucleus of the squad that won the IFC title in  and has also introduced some talented teenagers.He will rely on Adam Lynch, Pat Murdock, Ryan McAleenan, John Boyle, Eoghan Byrne and Ciaran McCartan to keep the Kilcoo attack quiet, bit few defences ever manage it.The Point cant afford to play in a defensive manner come Sunday. They must attack Kilcoo and utilise their magical set of forwards.McAleenans men have shipped a lot of scores in the league and to invite Kilcoo on to them would not be advisable.Thats why going at Kilcoo from the off and getting top scorer Ross McGarry involved early on is essential.McGarry is the one player who has the ability and temperament to unsettle Kilcoo.He is not the biggest full forward in the game, but he has pace, bravery and rarely misses in front of goal.He is undoubtedly Warrenpoints ace in the pack and along with the Boyle brothers adds a touch of class to the Points challenge.McGarry relies heavily on Donagh McAleenan, Ruairi McCormick, Aaron Magee, Ryan Mallon and Ryan Boyle and this unit must be firing on all cylindersWarrenpoint are to cause a shock win.Kilcoo are red hot favourites at   with a generous   being offered on Warrenpoint.

insipid displays in the SONI Premiership to push much-fancied Terenure right to the wire in their first appearance back in AIL Division A since .The Dublin outfit were the form team over the second half of last season and having recently clinched the Leinster Senior League title, were heavy favourites with pundits and bookmakers prior to kick off.They were also almost at full strength, while the home side were patched up in midfield after losing Rory Butler to injury. Veteran centre Stuart Morrow was again pressed into service with Aaron Cairns ing on the wing following concussion.Up front Ben Cullen earned the starting loose head spot and hugely influential number  Conall Boomer ed from injury. However, with eight players involved in the Ulster A Celtic Cup game on Friday night and four more in South Africa with the Pro squad, Brian McLaughlinrsquos options were limited.Tom Stewart and Connor Rankin were released to take their places on the bench, but the team that took the field was largely drawn from the squad which had been under-performing over the pre-AIL period.A few honest words on Tuesday night and an exceptional week on the training paddock clearly made a big dference as the home side tore into their opponents from the whistle.Playing away from the clubhouse and into the wet and gusty conditions, they drove into the Terenure half and were rewarded for an excellent scrum with a penalty to allow Sean OrsquoHagan to give his side the lead.Some indiscipline from a visibly fired up home forward pack allowed Terenure the chance to gain a foothold in the home half, but a superb turnover from Boomer on former lsquoHinch prop Campbell Classon allowed Ryan Wilson to clear.Cairns was doing his best to keep the home support involved and after skinning his opposite number twice in quick succession, he proceeded to drive him almost into the home dugout with a massive hit which got the home crowd even more fired up.However, a three point lead was scant reward for Ballynahinch after  minutes and Terenure began to turn the screw.They had a clear scrum advantage with referee Kieran Barry taking umbrage with Cullenrsquos angles and following a scrum deep in lsquoHinch territory, they went through the phases and eventually drove prop Liam Hyland over for a try at the posts to take a - lead.Moments later a superb long grubber kick forced Cairns back over his own line and Terenure won another penalty from the resulting m scrum.Declining the shot at goal they opted for another scrum and another infringement led to a penalty try, taking the lead out to - after  minutes.Undaunted, Ballynahinch finished the half strongly when a trademark Rhys OrsquoDonnell show and go sent him flying up the left touchline and almost over in the corner. Stout defending from Terenure averted the immediate danger, but a penalty for offside allowed OrsquoHagan to kick another penalty and cut the gap to - at half-time.As conditions worsened there was belief around the ground that this was not an insurmountable deficit, but disaster struck early in the first half when replacement Rankin elected to move the ball from deep.His long pass to a flying Ross Adair was only inches off target, but allowed the prolic Jake Swaine to hack through and win the race for the line to take his side  points clear at -. Ballynahinch refused to lie down and used the conditions to dominate field position.Blindside Aaron Hall put his injury nightmare behind by driving Terenure back at every opportunity and OrsquoHaganrsquos deadly boot dragged them back into the game with two penalties. When the under pressure Terenure outfit conceded another penalty in their own , almost everyone in the ground expected another three points.The ever-alert OrsquoDonnell had other ideas as he took a quick tap penalty and weaved his way over to score at the posts.OrsquoHaganrsquos conversion made it  all and as the weather really closed in, the home side were the clear favourites as they piled on the pressure in search of a win.Terenure defended well and were handed a leline when Cairns elected to run a speculative clearance instead of launching it back downfield.The ball was knocked on in the centre of the pitch and with heavyweight lock James Simpson off, the field Terenure once again exploited their scrum superiority to milk a penalty.Swaine held his nerve to nail the kick which, although central, was made tricky by the grim conditions.Ballynahinch threw everything at a tiring Terenure defence as the game entered injury time and after more than  phases of hammering away around the m line OrsquoHagan called for thegoal.The slippery conditions and heavy pressure meant his kick was a little rushed and it dropped short and wide to allow the away side to mark the ball and kick it out for a hard-earned win.The locals will reflect on a game they probably should have won, but will take an enormous amount of positives from the performance after visibly stepping up their physicality.Small margins will make a huge dference in this league and the fixtures come fast over the next few weeks. lsquoHinch travel to UCC this weekend to take on a student side buoyed by their demolition of much-fancied Trinity at the weekend and with the squad still thin due to Ulster Arsquos involvement in the Celtic Cup final, skipper John Donnan will have to lt his men for another big effort. However, he will be a happier man after his team showed that they belong in this company.Ballynahinch: Ben Cullen, Conor Piper, Johnny Blair, James Simpson, John Donnan , Aaron Hall, Olly Loughead, Conall Boomer, Rhys OrsquoDonnell, Sean OrsquoHagan, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Stuart Morrow, George Pringle, Ross Adair.

The atmosphere was relaxed and this was the end to a lovely day.On the final day of the visit, the group was invited to view the facilities at the Golf du Lys, an exclusive golf course, which has facilities to host conferences, weddings and events, along with outdoor and indoor tennis courts, an outdoor pool and golf courses.Ms Patterson said: ldquoThe golf club has already hosted some players from Ballynahinch and they have asked uswe are interested in organising a reciprocal golf tournament with the local golf courses in Co Down.ldquoWe hope we will be able to take them up on this proposal when the French visit us in .ldquoOur final lunch was in a redundant factory complex which has been converted in to a stunning hotel and restaurant ndash testament to how an old property can be re-generated for the good of the community.ldquoThe programme for the weekend provided us with ample opportunity to meet up with those who had travelled over to Ballynahinch in July and to meet with some old faces from previous exchanges between Lamorlaye and Ballynahinch. It is our hope we will be able to sign a twinning charter with both the local council for the next five to ten years.Ms Patterson said that the two pilot exchange trips have shown the relationship is still as vibrant as ever, with new people getting involved on both sides.She added: ldquoWe are hoping to be in a position to host a small group over the St Patrickrsquos weekend and to take a small group out to Lamorlaye for the Bastille Day celebrations. We always welcome new families who would be interested in hosting French people and who would be interested in travelling out to France as part of the exchange.ldquoThose travelling pay for their own flights and the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group has facilitated the visits through the generous support of Newry Mourne and Down Council. We would also like to thank Cllr Robert Burgess for helping us to revive the Lamorlaye Twinning Project and Cllr Andrews for representing the local council and accompanying the group to Lamorlaye and for his rendition of the Marseillaise in French..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Woman.jpg","title":"Woman jumped on PSNI car shouting ‘Up the ‘Ra’  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK woman jumped on the roof of a police car and shouted ldquoUp the lsquoRa in front of concert goers in Belfast, a court has heard.Kerry Anne Crane was given  months probation for her outburst at the Belsonic music festival over the summer.The -year-old, of Colmcille Road, was convicted of criminal damage and two separate counts of disorderly behaviour.Belfast Magistratesrsquo Court was told on Monday she climbed on to the bonnet of the police car on June  at the Ormeau Embankment.A prosecutor said Crane then walked up on to the roof, jumped up and down and shouted ldquoUp the lsquoRa.Large crowds were in the area at the time for the Belsonic festival in nearby Ormeau Park.The actions resulted in a number of dents to the carrsquos bodywork.When the defendant was arrested and cautioned she replied: ldquoNo, I just want to go home.In a second incident at a police checkpoint on Bryson Street in the city on July  she shouted similar slogans and made hand gestures at officers, according to the prosecution.A glass bottle was also smashed at the scene.A defence barrister stressed his clientrsquos remorse at her behaviour.ldquoShe accepts full responsibility, she is ashamed of her actions, he told the court.Mr Curran submitted that Crane has suffered a combination of mental health dficulties and alcohol addiction, but had remained sober since July..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10538638.jpg","title":"capturing fleeting moment dramatic artwork","story":"JC: What is your artistic background  Are you self-taught or did you go to art school do courses JC: What inspires your art JC: Who what are your biggest in#uences JC: Is there a speci#c place that you do your work JC: What has been your most ambitious piece to date JC: What has been your favourite project to date JC: What dferent artistic mediums do you use and which is your favourite JC: Do you exhibit your work anywhere JC: What are you up to when you arenrsquot painting JC: How would you describe your artistic style JC: What does your art mean to you This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Language is what makes the heart audible. We had a teacher who came to our primary school and taught me the meaning of my name. Gorm is the Irish word for blue. Gorman were the people whose hair was so black it had a blue sheen off it. I thought, ‘wow’. I was about nine, I wanted to find out more. “I started to learn Irish, I went away on summer courses. It’s important to me.“I understand that there are people from the same bit of ground as I am who speak Ulster-Scots to whom that is equally important. I wanted to find out more.“My dad would have used Ulster-Scots expressions at home before I realised what they were. He’d say things like ‘red up’ and called us gaunches, or better, carnaptious gaunches. One of my favourite words in any language is the word ‘thran’.”For the programme Damian s to the Ards peninsula as he tries to understand why, for so many people, Ulster-Scots and its literary heritage is still important and relevant today. He reconnects with Hugh Robinson, who helped him start a writers’ group there, and spends time with native speakers and scholars including Carole Gilmore and Elaine McFeeters.Of the Irish language act which has seen red lines drawn at Stormont, and the limited use of Ulster-Scots in the Province, Damian said: “In our part of the world there are dficult conversations still to be had and that being the case I just think we need all the language we can get.”In his spare time Damian teaches conversational English to a group of Syrian refuges in Wales: “As has been pointed out to me I’ve passed on quite a bit of Ulster–Scots. There are people from Aleppo and Homs who are running round Aberystwyth using words like ‘red up’ and ‘carnaptious’.”Huge interest in new book on RHI scandal by Sam McBrideLatest update from criminal cases heard at Portsmouth Magistrates Court Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingF**k the Pope and the I.R.A. -

We talked about a lot of the issues regarding who has complained and itrsquos a very small group of people.ldquoAs compared to the picture painted for them by neighbours, [the council] were surprised at what we were doing and how compliant wersquore already being.ldquoWersquore hopeful of a positive outcome but we donrsquot know whatrsquos going to happen.ldquoWe have had thousands of messages of support from emails and twitter messages. Mostly itrsquos people seeing itrsquos such a positive thing wersquore doing.Marcus Goldsworthy, head of planning and regeneration at Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoA planning application has been submitted for the temporary use of a former residential annex as a school.ldquoThe application remains under consideration and planning officers have met with the applicant and her agents to discuss the further information that is required to support the application, and allow it to be fully considered. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees. I liked the chanting, lsquoclimate justice nowrsquo but this is not just fun to shout, itrsquos actually really important.Sister Lily-Rose Kitchiner, , said: ldquoPeople in places like Africa suffer because of how we live here and it needs to stop. The government needs to do more to stop climate change.ldquoI donrsquot know why we have to tell them this, why donrsquot they think itrsquos important Penarth resident and leader of Wales Green Party, Anthony Slaughter, also attended the march. He said: \"The massive turnout for the climate strike march in Cardf showed the strength of feeling from all sections of our community on the ongoing crisis and the impacts already being felt across the world.\"While people of all ages were present, this was a day when young voices were prominent with speaker after speaker articulating their generations anger at government inertia. This was a day for politicians to listen and take real, meaningful action to tackle the climate emergency.\"Business as usual is no longer an option.\"The Welsh Government has declared a ldquoclimate emergency and set a target to cut carbon emission by  per cent by .Millions of people across the globe have joined the strikes, with major cities brought to a stand-still.Greta Thunberg, the -year-old who sparked the movement with a solitary protest outside Swedish parliament in August  tweeted: ldquoChange is coming. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their mother Emma, who was found straying by local authorities, gave birth to the  puppies shortly after arriving at the Rehoming Centre.One of the litter of rescue puppies hoping they wont be left in the lurchThe puppies, named after popular award-winning actors and actresses, are now more than eight weeks old and canine carers at the busy Rehoming Centre have been working hard to get them prepared for their potential new owners. The puppies currently available for adoption are named: Emmy, Brando, Legend, Jolie, Heath, Goldberg and Leonardo.Oonagh Phillips, Rehoming Centre Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, said: “The Rehoming Centre is no stranger to puppy residents however, we do find that Lurcher puppies tend to stay with us a bit longer. We hope to find this litter new owners soon, so they can quickly adjust to being part of a loving family.“Canine carers at Dogs Trust Ballymena have found there is often misconceptions about the Lurcher breed, with people often thinking they require lots of exercise. Lurchers actually don’t require any more exercise than a typical dog and many enjoy staying cozy and snuggling up for a snooze.“At such a young age they will all need homes where they will be given lots of care and attention, as well as ongoing support with their training. Families who adopt any of the puppies will be invited to join Dogs Trust’s Dog School at ious locations across Northern Ireland.”Dog Trust’s Dog School was launched in  to support dog owners and their pets through our reward based training methods, teaching valuable skills needed for everyday le. Dog School is just as much about supporting and guiding owners as it is about training the dog. Classes run over five weeks and each dog owner will receive training homework after the class to practise at home. It is important for owners to continue the training at home on a regular basis to practice what their pet has learned in class.If you believe a dog is for le and would like to find out more about the adorable Lurcher puppies, get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymena.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis.

One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar.
