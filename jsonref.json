Boris Johnson promised us the rights to all the fish that swim in our exclusive economic zone and we have got a fraction of that.\u0027We are absolutely worse off. When we were within the EU we used to trade fish with the EU. We used to swap things we didn\u0027t use with fish that they didn\u0027t use and that enabled us to put together an annual fishing plan.\u0027What we have got now is a fraction of what we were promised through Brexit. We are going to really, really struggle this year.\u0027When Boris Johnson and his Government promised Brexit to the fishermen he promised none of us would be worse off. There is a considerable amount of fishermen – small families, small communities – absolutely worse off by this deal.\u0027Mr Gove also defended the deal over accusations it could prompt a wave of deregulation once the transition period ends on December 31. He dismissed those concerns, telling the BBC: \u0027No, I think it means smarter and better regulation so if we look at the way in which the EU has regulated in the past when it has come to financial services it hasn\u0027t always regulated in a way which works to the advantage of the UK.\u0027London is the biggest financial centre in Europe. One of the two greatest financial centres in the world and EU regulation hasn\u0027t always been as enlightened as it might have been in making sure that we can regulate smartly and effectively.\u0027 The Government has also faced criticism over its decision to withdraw from the Erasmus education scheme. Ministers will replace it with a so-called Turing scheme which will see more than £100million spent on sending 35,000 students on international university placements. Mr Gove said the Government had wanted to stay in the Erasmus scheme but \u0027only on terms that were fair to the UK taxpayer\u0027.He said the cost of staying in the scheme would have been \u0027too great\u0027 under the terms set out by the EU. The trade deal is expected to sail through Parliament on Wednesday thanks to the PM\u0027s 80-seat majority and the backing of Labour. But Sir Keir is facing a revolt over his decision to impose a three-line-whip on his MPs to support the accord.Labour whips are in the process of calling MPs to urge them to vote for the Future Relationship Bill amid fears dozens in Remain-backing seats could rebel.        No shadow cabinet resignations are expected but sources told The Times that half a dozen frontbenchers in junior roles could quit.   Wednesday\u0027s debate and vote will see hundreds of MPs take part and vote virtually after Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle encouraged them to stay away because of coronavirus concerns. But Tory Brexiteers are demanding the chance to take part in person, arguing that such an \u0027historic occasion\u0027 should not be conducted from offices and living rooms.Coronavirus rules mean that only a maximum of 50 people are allowed in the Commons chamber at any one time.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Huge 40ft sinkhole swallows entire TREE","story":"Share this article \u0027I suppose fortunately as far we can see, nothing was damaged and no people were hurt. It\u0027s just sad that the tree, a lovely tree, is obviously gone.\u0027 In a statement on Boxing Day, Bristol City Council said: \u0027Structural engineers have assessed the collapsed vault at Canynge Square, Clifton.\u0027We are confident there is no risk to property or residents.

I’m a living testament to the failure of that horrific ideology.”Indigenous communities in the US, and globally, are disproportionately vulnerable to the impact of the climate crisis such as rising sea levels and droughts, and environmental hazards resulting from polluting industries. As secretary of the interior, Haaland will play a key role in undoing Trump’s rollbacks and will also be a key lieutenant in Biden’s new climate team.This is not the first time Haaland has made history. In 2018, she became one of the first two Native women in Congress, alongside Sharice Davids of Kansas. In January, a record-breaking six Native Americans – four Democrats and two Republicans – will be sworn in.Representation and ersity matter, according to Haaland, because life experiences shape political decisions. “We don’t need people who all have the same perspective, we need people from various parts of the country, who’ve been raised in different ways, who bring that history and culture with them, and employ what we’ve learnt from their parents and grandparents, and bring all of that to bear in the decisions that we make,” she told the .It’s been a rocky road for Haaland who like a disproportionate number of Native Americans has experienced homelessness and relied on food stamps. She is also the product of racist policies such as the forced removal of thousands of Native children from their families between 1860 and 1978. At the age of eight, Haaland’s grandmother was sent to a Catholic boarding school for five years a hundred miles from home.“There are a lot of people in this country who suffered historical trauma from that era. I carry that history with me, I’m a product of the assimilation policy of the United States. I feel very strongly that having this perspective is super important for the issues we bring to Congress.”Haaland was elected to the House of Representatives in 2018 after campaigning under the slogan: “Congress has never heard a voice like mine.” Since then, she has introduced legislation that would establish a truth commission on Native American boarding schools and spearheaded two laws to combat the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women – crimes increasingly linked to transient extractive industry workers living in so-called man camps near or on tribal lands.“Indigenous women have been missing and murdered since Europeans came to this continent in the late 1400s. Violence against women is a priority of mine. It’s not going to be fixed with just two pieces of legislation, but now it’s time to dig deeper and keep working,” she said.Haaland will be the most senior Native American in the US government since the Republican Charles Curtis, a member of the Kaw nation situated in what is now Kansas, who served as vice-president to Herbert Hoover between 1929 and 1933.She will be part of a government facing unprecedented complex and interconnected challenges including an out-of-control pandemic, global economic recession, spiralling hunger and the climate emergency.Haaland’s track record working across partisan lines may also prove vital for Biden’s success, at a time when the country – and lawmakers – are deeply ided.She said: “I’ve gotten more Republicans to sign on to my bills than any other Democrat. It’s important for all of us – county commissioners, governors and mayors, not just Congress – to make sure we’re working together for the greater good. We want to pass laws that will help people across the country, and we need to make sure these messages are getting out … I’m going to continue to reach across the aisle, to protect our environment and make sure that vulnerable communities have a say in what our country is doing moving forward.”The Department of the Interior’s 70,000 or so staff oversee one-fifth of all the land in the US and 1.7bn acres of coastlines, as well as managing national parks, wildlife refuges and natural resources such as gas, oil and water.A shift in priorities at the interior department could have major implications for global heating as about one-quarter of all US carbon emissions come from fossil fuels extracted on public lands, according to the US Geological Survey.“Environmental injustice and economic injustice have taken a hold of so many communities, and they’ve had enough. They want us to pay attention and help them to succeed … As far as Indian Country is concerned, I want to make sure tribal leaders – and all marginalized communities – have a seat at the table.”Restoring protections eroded by Trump for Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante – national monuments in southern Utah which are sacred to Native Americans, is a priority for Haaland.November’s elections took place after a summer of unprecedented protests demanding racial justice sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who was killed by a white police officer kneeling on his neck for almost nine minutes.Progressive Democrats, including Haaland and the so-called Squad – made up of congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib - elevated demands by protesters for radical structural changes to eradicate racial inequalities in health, housing, immigration, education, jobs and the environment.“So many Native Americans joined the Black Lives Matter protests because Indian Country recognised that we are allies in the fight for environmental justice, economic justice and racial justice … These communities on the frontline deserve to have the resources to be able to lift themselves up,” Haaland said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eca57f9d11861391129488e6a1438b3c692c17f0/0_205_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=544f01b5be3d1e141e8df359e2765fd5","title":"crystal palace leicester city premier league match report","story":"It was a moment that called for clear thinking. As Leicester poured forward in the closing stages, desperately chasing the goal that would have lifted them a point behind Liverpool at the top of the table, control slipped away.With the minutes ticking by, they needed calm and ruthlessness: someone to pause, take a deep breath and cut through all that demented running taking place near the Crystal Palace area.Level through a stinging low drive from Harvey Barnes, Leicester had seven minutes to establish their title credentials. After failing to make their dominance count during a frustrating first half, they had responded after falling behind to Wilfried Zaha’s crisp opener for Palace. Roared on by their bench, they pinned Palace back, sprinted hard and hunted that one crucial opening.Yet the cries grew more anguished as full-time approached. Thoughts drifted back to the first half and Vicente Guaita denying Leicester an early lead when he saved Kelechi Iheanacho’s tame penalty. Careless in the attacking third, Leicester ended up playing against the clock, rushing the final pass and finishing rashly, never more so than when Ayoze Pérez slashed a wonderful chance over the bar in the fourth minute of added time.Time ran out as Pérez’s hurried effort sailed over. Not composed enough to capitalise on Liverpool’s dropped points against West Brom, Leicester ended up falling short despite rising above Everton into second place. “We’re disappointed with the result,” Brendan Rodgers said. “You’ve got to take your chances.”The demands of the festive schedule also worked against Leicester, robbing them of a cutting edge. A situation that required Rodgers to make seven changes to the side who drew with Manchester United on Saturday felt deeply unsatisfactory, hammering home the absurdity of asking teams to play twice in the space of 48 hours.If anyone benefited, though, perhaps it was the Palace defenders who were spared the task of keeping up with Jamie Vardy during the opening period. With Rodgers determined to keep his side fresh, Leicester rotated. Timothy Castagne, Wesley Fofana and James Maddison were missing, Youri Tielemans and Wilfred Ndidi stepped out of midfield and there was a lack of ruthlessness in an attack led by Iheanacho.In normal circumstances it would have been Vardy stepping up to give Leicester a 17th-minute lead after James Tomkins’ foul on Luke Thomas, who had caught Palace napping with a surge from left-back. With Leicester’s leading scorer on the bench, however, spot-kick duties fell to a forward without a goal in the league this season.Iheanacho stepped up, angling his run towards the ball in a way that betrayed his intentions. It was unsurprising to see him place his effort at a decent height for Guaita, who got a strong hand to the ball.There would be more profligacy from Iheanacho when he headed over from four yards. Wastefulness was ruining Leicester’s composed approach play and when Pérez saw a deflected cross bounce off the bar, Dennis Praet fired over.“If you’re looking at the game over 90 minutes, I have to say I am pleased with the point,” Roy Hodgson, the Palace manager, said.He had also made changes, although perhaps that owed more to Hodgson needing to shake up his team after a worrying dip. Thumped 7-0 by Liverpool in their previous home game, they were awful when they lost 3-0 to 10-man Aston Villa on Saturday.Palace were content to sit back, although they did have a couple of openings before the interval. Andros Townsend wasted the best, steering Jeffrey Schlupp’s cutback wide, while replays showed they should have been awarded a penalty in the first half after Daniel Amartey’s handball was strangely not reviewed by VAR.There was more intensity from Palace at the start of the second half. Zaha had struggled, giving the ball away too cheaply, but he remained the likeliest player to hurt Leicester. It was a different game once he started to find space to turn and dribble.After 58 minutes Zaha dropped deep, turned cleverly and found Townsend on the right. Rather than stand back and admire his pass, he kept moving. Townsend whipped in a left-foot inswinger and Zaha was rewarded for gambling, ghosting to the far post unnoticed, perfectly placed to meet the cross with a fine volley.Yet Palace, who are winless in five games, could not hold on. Leicester introduced Vardy and Barnes provided the spark, jinking to find space before drilling home from 18 yards.Emboldened, Leicester began the hunt for a winner only for Pérez to fluff his lines. The prospect of a proper title race remains in the balance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e0013276a658c70afd2505e2eeef507ca862eeb/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2c0c4ec8a5ed4805e8db23d450cc26a","title":"how a tree mortgage scheme could turn an indian town carbon neutral","story":"Kerala villagers are reaping the benefits of a scheme that pays them to leave their trees rooted, reducing risk of deforestationIn the misty, hilly terrain of Wayanad, in the southern Indian state of Kerala, the people with any access to land in the quiet town of Meenangadi have been out counting their trees.Sheeja CG, a 46-year-old farmer, has lived among coffee, coconut and pepper plantations all her life but last month she increased her income dramatically by mortgaging 53 of her trees at the local bank, in return for a sum of 2,650 rupees (£26.96), or 50 rupees each. She was one of the first beneficiaries of the state-sponsored scheme.It’s a simple incentive with big gains: plant a tree, and after three years residents can mortgage each sapling for an interest-free loan that can be renewed annually for 10 years. The money need be repaid only if the tree is chopped down.Kerala, with its sweeping, spice-filled forested landscape has been troubled in recent years by an ailing farming sector, deforestation which has led to loss of bioersity, and the climate crisis making summers much warmer, especially in the Wayanad, which used to be comfortably cool.Suicides of farmers, landslides and floods have made the headlines. Farmers have been compelled to fell trees to supplement their income. Against such a background, the tree banking project, facilitated by a 10 crores rupee (£1.01m) grant from the state government, comes as a big incentive to keep them rooted to the ground.Prolonged dry spells and erratic rainfall have made the region increasingly vulnerable, with shrinking paddy farms and a threat to cash crops such as pepper and coffee. According to the Kerala State Action Plan on Climate Change, Wayanad is one of the four major climate change hotspots in the state.But the tree banking scheme has an ambition to reverse the damage and turn Meenangadi, a town of about 35,000 people into a carbon neutral region. The Carbon Neutral Meenangadi Project is the first of its kind in India, and has changed the way the community lives and works.“An energy audit in 2018 found Meenangadi had 15,000 tonnes of excess carbon. We are working on ways to bring it down to zero,” says Meenangadi’s panchayat (local government) president, Beena Vijayan. To balance the carbon emissions, a meticulous action plan has been set in motion.“We have held more than 500 meetings with farmers in every nook and corner on waste management, recycling plastic, solar lighting and panels, manufacturing environment friendly coffee and using high-efficiency stoves,” says Vijayan.Encouraging tree planting is a first step. “It is a model project for the whole district of Wayanad. It took root three years ago, when we prepared a nursery with 33 types of saplings under the national rural employment guarantee scheme. We planted 300,000 saplings in 250 homes in Meenangadi and common areas,” says Vijayan.“With the trees now mature, we rolled out the tree banking scheme and received about 200 applications that are being processed.”It was Kerala’s finance minster, TM Thomas Isaac, who first mooted the idea, saying it wouldguarantee a sustainable income for farmers in the district and vastly improve the socio-economic environment.“Wayanad has the lowest per capita income in Kerala state, so the aim is to double the income of the farmers without overly industrialising the region,” says Jayakumar C, founderof Thanal, the environment agency that is implementing the project. The trees also bring supplementary income to the residents, through the sale of fruit and other products, he adds.Among the thickets around her red-roofed cottage is a cluster of jackfruit trees that Sheeja has mortgaged, white tags hanging from their branches. The trees are monitored through an app.“We go from farm to farm with a team of volunteers to survey the trees that have matured, take photographs and map them on our monitoring system,” says Ajith Tomy, the project coordinator. “We will implement the project in 23 other panchayats in Wayanad by 2021. We plan to plant about 10m trees in the next few years.”For Sumathy Valiyakolli, the loan has come through at just the right time, as expenses for her brother’s medical treatment are mounting. She says: “It’s been very helpful. I will plant more trees and mortgage a higher number next year.”Sign up for the Global Dispatch newsletter – a fortnightly roundup of our top stories, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d690b326185f61419e8322baaea0fe225d7aad7/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8a4f4034cd9adcaab6d62a2d4bab403","title":"from the voice to geocaching four of the best apps to download this christmas","story":"Entertain the kids with these fun games that the whole family can enjoy together over the holidaysEvery toy has been played with, the sofa has been turned into a fort a hundred times over, and if you suggest “a nice walk in the woods” one more time, there’s a significant chance the kids might actually explode.Christmas is traditionally a time for togetherness but after repeating the same holiday rituals year after year it’s no surprise that the assembled crowd is gagging for something new.

A good set of noise-cancelling earbuds can really help, not only to block out what’s going on around you, but also so you don’t get echoey feedback from playing the call out loud. The Galaxy Buds Live come in black, white or – most festive – bronze, and have three built-in mics: two for blocking background noise and one for clearly picking up your voice. They fast-charge wirelessly in their case and last up to 21 hours at a time – plus when you’re not on a call, they’re great for listening to music.Best wifi booster: Netgear WiFi 6 Orbi, £449.99, netgearGood wifi is essential to a flawless video call.

A mesh system that sends out a “net” of wifi signal that blankets every corner of your home. You plug it in to your existing router, then add one or more “satellite” stations farther away, and it connects up every inch in between. A mesh system is much more powerful than a signal booster, and the Orbi range is one of the best.

With close but clear results, he refused to concede, concocting a series of unhinged conspiracy theories about stolen votes and fraud – lies he still maintains. But laughs soon arrived, in the form of the Trump “voter fraud hotline”, which loyal patriots were meant to call into with evidence of fraud. It soon devolved into a debacle, as an army of pranksters flooded the phone lines with ridiculous tales meant to highlight the absurdity of the proceedings.“It’s misery. It’s one of the worst ways to end a campaign you could think of,” one campaign staffer fielding the calls said, calling the prank calls traumatizing. The hotline was soon shut down. What a small joyous gift to watch it all happen in a year otherwise full of bad news.They say blood is thicker than water, but in some cases, not even that can guarantee a complimentary reference. That was the case for one of our heroes – a college graduate who begged her followers to “please, for the love of God” not to vote for her Republican father who was running in the Michigan primaries.The two disagreed about structural racism, white privilege and Black Lives Matter, but Regan wanted people to make up their own minds: “look him up and just read for yourself,” she said.Regan, by the way, ultimately lost the primary, so perhaps his daughter’s statement was a damning blow. A father should be proud.In 2010 the artist Craig Damrauer made prints with the slogan “Modern art  I could do that + Yeah, but you didn’t”. You could say that about a lot of viral stardom, whether it’s Chewbacca Mom (who laughed in a car while wearing a mask), Mason Ramsey (who yodeled in a Walmart), or Doggface – my 2020 hero.Doggface (AKA Nathan Apodaca) went viral in September after filming himself skating down a highway to Fleetwood Mac’s Dreams while sipping a bottle of Ocean Spray. The video has 73m views on TikTok alone.Jumping on a skateboard is not particularly noteworthy, nor is drinking a fruity drink while doing so. But there’s something in the frictionlessway Doggface does it that makes it so special. Before his viral fame Doggface was living in a trailer in Idaho, way below the poverty line, without water or electricity. In the video he’s actually skateboarding to work because his car broke down.Then his life changed in the blink of an eye. Ocean Spray gave him a new truck. Stevie Nicks paid tribute to him. He bought a home. He even just starred in the new music video for David Guetta’s remix of Dreams.Some people probably see him as a champion of the American Dream, but Doggface isn’t my hero because he went viral and got rich. He’s my hero because he was just trying to make the most of another shitty day, and he put a smile on all of our faces while doing so.Every time the meme crossed my path online this year, I saw something of myself in the dog’s vacant smile, bug-eyed paralysis, and impotent optimism. I, too, was sitting with a mug of coffee amid a global pandemic, telling myself it was fine because I needed to hear it, even though it was palpably untrue.In fact, the cartoon had been inspired by Green’s misgivings about starting antidepressants for the first time before 2016, it was embraced by teenagers worried about their upcoming exams. “It’s become a catch-all for anything,” Green says wearily from his home in western Massachusetts.Though he has been able to monetise his creation through “This is Fine” merchandise (including, this year, a face mask), Green admits to having become somewhat numb to its outsize online presence.Indeed, he noticed applications of the meme became more elaborate and high-concept this year as people sought to pass time in quarantine, superimposing themselves in the place of the dog, or showing him surrounded by toilet paper piled high. (The room in flames also became a popular Zoom background.)One spin-off stood out, however. After Joe Biden was confirmed as president-elect in November, an animated gif went viral that showed the dog being carried out of a burning building by a firefighter – mug of coffee in hand.Green, too, was moved by the hopefulness of the clip, imagining a happy ending for his tired, put-upon creation.“I felt something,” he agrees. “The first time I saw it.”Doug Emhoff, more widely known as “Kamala Harris’s husband”, is set to be the first US second gentleman. And in the spirit of equality, we will be referring to a man in reference to his wife for once, rather than the other way around.Credit where credit’s due, Emhoff really did take a back seat in 2020, letting his wife shine. The entertainment lawyer will clearly do anything for his other half: last year, he physically removed a protester from the stage at a Harris event. I guess behind every great woman is a man ready to tackle anyone that interrupts her when she’s speaking.Emhoff also took time out of his day job to campaign for Harris and has since quit his private law firm to be a full-time house-husband (White House husband, that is). Suppressing his male ego and taking one for the team may have helped Harris secure her win as the first woman of color VP. Emhoff’s new title is an exciting opportunity to see traditional gender dynamics flipped on its head. I can’t wait to see a man help decorate the White House for Christmas. Honestly, anything will be better than the Shining theme Melania went for in 2017. If Kamala’s presidential campaign is any indication, he will handle his new role with grace and humility and live up to the name gentleman. No doubt he’ll have a delicious homemade meal ready for the vice-president when she gets home from a long day at the office. So to all you heterosexual men out there: take several notes.Not all heroes wear masks. But one hero foresaw something even more important than mask-wearing in this pandemic – free, accessible and routine Covid-19 testing. That person is Representative Katie Porter.Before Porter came along with her whiteboard, high-up officials did not seem to know the cost of the battery of tests required to discern who has the virus in the US ($1,331), nor of a federal code that would allow them to make that testing free and available instantaneously.But Porter had done her research and was there to help out. She reminded the director of the CDC that without free testing for all, there would be no way of knowing who does and does not have the virus. “Do you wanna know who has the coronavirus and who doesn’t – not just rich people – but everybody who might have the virus?” she asked.And just like that, the commitment was made. Sadly, 300,000 lives have been lost to the virus in the US, but without Porter, things could have been a lot worse.There is nowhere to hide on a bookcase – which is why nosy people make a beeline for them. Your neuroses and nostalgia are laid bare in the self-help titles not quite concealed on the lower shelves, the dissonant notes struck by gifts from friends, the repeat reads revealed by cracked spines.This year, we exposed our shelves to the world thanks to endless Zoom meetings. Their strength lay in their combining universality and iniduality: more interesting than a bare wall, less intimate than a bed, easier to tidy than a kitchen.Even an Ikea Billy gave depth (11in, to be precise) to a webcam window. But after weeks inside our own homes, starved of human interest, it is no surprise that we soon started taking a closer look.In April, Bookcase Credibility joined Twitter to pass judgment on the book-lined backdrops of TV talking heads. Elon Musk’s bare shelves, holding only four editions of seemingly the same book, embodied the performative minimalism of Silicon Valley. The titles piling into each other like dominos behind Natalie Portman implied frequent use.Even inidual titles spoke volumes. In May, the UK cabinet office minister, Michael Gove, was called on to explain his copies of The Bell Curve (arguing a link between race and IQ) and work by the Holocaust denier David Irving after his wife posted a photo of their home.In 2020, our shelves stood in for ourselves – so it’s no wonder we read so much into them. As Bookcase Credibility says: “What you say is not as important as the bookcase behind you.” Oh, Nevada. We are in a love-hate relationship. You took five times longer than most states to deliver the election result. (I had to remind myself whether the result had been called for Nevada yet just writing this.) A provision in Nevada’s election law meant poll workers took the night off in the middle of its ballot counting. Because of this, the whole world was waiting on the edge of its seat for a result while Nevada got some beauty sleep.Between the technical difficulties and awkward silences to the sinking feeling of missing out, remote class can be a nightmare. It’s hard to feel connected when the only interaction students have with their teachers is through the dreaded Zoom Room. But one history professor at Chapman University, Dr James Brown, managed to make it work – to the point where his students organized a surprise to let him know how much they appreciated him.In a viral TikTok, all the students started out their last class of the semester with their cameras off, prompting Brown to ask whether or not it’s a “cool new thing to do to not turn your cameras on”. Later, he grew more upset. “Seriously?” he asks. “Is it my fault that you have your cameras off?” His students then turned on their cameras, revealing handwritten thank you posters. He starts crying. I start crying. You’ll probably start crying, too.This year has been particularly challenging for students, but teachers and professors are adapting to the best of their ability against all odds. That makes them heroes in our eyes.For nearly all of 2020, election officials faced the nearly impossible task of figuring out how to hold an election in the midst of a pandemic.That election day passed without any systemic failures is testament to the volunteers who stepped up to help out, and officials working quietly behind the scenes to adapt. But Trump’s battle against the outcome resulted in vicious attacks and threats against election officials across the country.One official, Tina Barton, who has been the city clerk in Rochester Hills, just outside of Detroit, since 2013, received threatening phone calls that included foul and sexually explicit language. “You start to just question your career choice. Is this something I want to continue to do and is there value in continuing to do this? You go through all those range of emotions,” she told the .Despite the fear tactics, Barton, a Republican, publicly pushed back on claims of election irregularities in Rochester Hills. Ultimately, it was her duty to voters that kept her going.Here’s a not-so-hot hot take: the US needs more paid, federal holidays. We’re notoriously stingy with them, especially compared with more bon vivant countries such as France and Spain. And so who is more fitting of an unsung heroes’ crown, than the woman who campaigned for, and won, an additional federal holiday for us all this year?Enter 96-year-old Opal Lee. The Texan has fought tirelessly to see Juneteenth become a federally recognized holiday. This day is loaded with jubilation and pain for Black Americans. It celebrates 19 June 1865, when Galveston slaves first learned of the freedoms granted to them by the Emancipation Proclamation. The holiday has long been observed in southern states, where Black residents eat red foods that signify freedom, including watermelon, red velvet cake and hot sauce. In 2016, Lee, then 89, walked from her Fort Worth, Texas, home to Washington DC in the hopes of pushing Congress to make Juneteenth a national holiday.When pressed on the difference between Independence Day and Juneteenth, Opal deftly responded, “… the Fourth of July? Slaves weren’t free. You know that, don’t you?”This year, Opal finally saw the fruits of her labor. Amid a reckoning around race in America, New York and Virginia joined 45 other states and the District of Columbia in recognizing Juneteenth as a public holiday. Now we’re looking at you, North Dakota, South Dakota and Hawaii …When I was growing up, obsessing over a boy band was pretty low-stakes. It usually involved voting for music videos on TRL or trying to cop seats to a gig on Ticketmaster before the site crashed. This year, however, K-Pop fans used their skills to become grassroots activists quelling racist police tactics dampening attendance numbers for a Trump rally and crowdsourcing a million-dollar donation for the Black Lives Matter movement. Their ultimate show of force came this summer, during the height of Black Lives Matter protests across the globe. The Dallas police department asked residents to submit videos of “illegal protest activity” to its iWatch Dallas app. K-Pop fans took note of the serious privacy and safety risks that posed to protesters and flooded the app with fancams (which are hard to explain to anyone who can remember using a fax machine, but they’re basically montages of a celebrity set to fun music – like the Gen-Z version of fan mail). They swamped the system, with the Dallas PD announcing its app was down due to “technical difficulties” hours later. And who says all Gen-Zers do is post dance videos to TikTok?“When we saw a minority of people being treated unfairly, we wanted to do something to help,” Mel, a K-Pop fan who lives in Texas, told the . “I thought the fancams would only slow down the app for an hour or two, so I was super-surprised when we shut the whole app down!”David Chang, the founder of the Momofuku restaurant group, turned to ABC’s hit game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? in October to raise money for hurting restaurants who had spent months pleading with congressional members for guidance and relief.There were some bumpy patches throughout the episode: Chang wasn’t sure about which Superman comic cover was auctioned for more than $3m, nor did he know which Peter, Paul \u0026amp Mary song a SpaceX craft was named after. Luckily, he was able to ask director Alan Yang and host Jimmy Kimmel for help.Then came the million-dollar question: which US president was the first to have electricity? Chang still had one lifeline option left, so he phoned friend and journalist Mina Kimes, who helped Chang settle on Benjamin Harrison for an answer.Chang guessed correctly and became the first celebrity ever to win the million-dollar prize. He donated his winnings to the Southern Smoke Foundation, an organization that provides grants for emergency expenses in the food industry. On his podcast, he said he had watched the show and played the app to prepare, but those exercises couldn’t ready him for the stress and anxiety of being in the hotseat.Ultimately, it was his predilection for gambling that got him through. “I’m a gambling man and shame on me if this is wrong,” Chang said on the show, “but I’m doing this because having a million dollars right now, in this moment, is a game-changer for many, many families.”Chang isn’t the only celeb chef pitching in to save restaurants. Guy Fieri raised more than $21.5m for the Restaurant Employee Relief Fund. It shouldn’t be up to celebrity chefs to come to the rescue of the food industry – that’s the federal government’s responsibility – but it at least earns them a crown in our books.In virus-hit New York City, it’s no longer allowed to dine indoors, it’s far too cold to eat outdoors and going grocery shopping could mean hiking through more than a foot of snow.So how do 7 million hungry residents stay fed? The answer here, as in cities around the world, is delivery workers: disproportionately older and migrant men of color, working around the clock through conditions that were brutal and dangerous even before a life-threatening pandemic, kept precarious by unconscionably low pay, with nearly no labor protections to speak of.Since March, local leaders and Silicon Valley CEOs have heaped praise on delivery workers, labeling them “essential”, calling them “heroes” – as close as we’ll get to an acknowledgment of the workers’ pivotal role in our collective survival. Yet under late capitalism these words really seem to mean “please keep working until you collapse”.Delivery workers have been among the hardest-hit by Covid-19 – but because they are commonly misclassified as “independent contractors”, they have been left out of the sick pay and unemployment insurance thatkeeps millions of Americans afloat. Is this how we should treat our heroes? When will society deliver for them, for a change?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4e5d3d50815671428297d9436d3abac5b03128c/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a972817b1ab4eb21059d19b346f36f00","title":"how lewis hamilton became one of the uks top sports stars and activists","story":"Writers Michael Eboda and Oliver Owen look at how a 12-year-old go karting champion went on to become Formula One’s most successful driver. This year, more than ever, Hamilton has also been leading the fight against racismThis year, the driver Lewis Hamilton equalled a record seven Formula One world championships when he won the Turkish grand prix in November. Many believe Hamilton is the greatest Formula One driver of all time. He also won BBC Sports Personality of the Year this month and topped The Powerlist 2021, the annual list of the most influential people of African, African Caribbean and African American heritage in the UK. Hamilton is the first sports star to take top billing in the list’s 14-year history. Michael Eboda, the chief executive of Powerful Media, the publisher of the list, tells Rachel Humphreys about meeting a 12-year-old Lewis Hamilton on a go-karting course. It was clear even then, Eboda says, that Hamilton was special. This year he interviewed the driver again, and talked to him about his anti-racism activism. Hamilton has encouraged his fellow drivers to back him by taking a knee before each race convinced his team, Mercedes, to change its cars’ livery from silver to black and set up a commission to make the sport more erse at all levels of employment – all the while showcasing the Black Lives Matter cause with a T-shirt and matching BLM face mask. Humphreys also talks to Oliver Owen, associate editor at the Official Formula 1 magazine. He explains how the combination of Hamilton’s extraordinary talent and “brilliant racing brain” has shaped him into one of the greatest Formula One drivers of all time.

People move there or stay there because they fall in love with the gothic revival Victorian houses, which exist in various states of renovation or decay. One of those people was photographer Carolyn Drake, who settled in Water Valley a few years ago, having returned from a decade of travelling in Russia and Asia, including a spell living and photographing in Uighur villages on the edge of the Taklamakan desert.Drake spent two years in Water Valley hardly picking up her camera. She wasn’t sure how to photograph the place without it looking like a New Yorker’s view of “the south”. It was only after she became part of a knitting circle, an insider, sitting on her friend Katharine’s porch drinking IPA, stitching rugs, listening to true crime podcasts, that she found a way to do that. Knit Club, her strange and powerful book of photographs of the women of Water Valley, is the result.This picture, in which her fellow knitters and quilters are obscured by flowers, captures one of the themes of her book, an extreme playfulness with ideas of motherhood and femininity – ideas she had tended “to run away from with her camera”. In the collaborative community of the knit club she began to question why she resisted those ideas. Some of her photographs are taken in abandoned houses, some in dusky woodland several suggest mysterious sisterly ritual. In most, Drake has suggested, the women’s faces are obscured to avoid replicating the male gaze. There are no captions, but brief fragments of quotation in the book, from the knitters. Katharine, for example, says: “I live right in the middle of town, so everybody sees us sitting out here. A couple of my friends’ ex-husbands, they just hate it. They’re like: ‘These chicks are up to no good.’ Maybe they’re right.”Knit Club is published by TBW Books"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13f7506395c3153e1b884456cd38e3364306e95a/0_0_3872_2323/master/3872.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0498869b2423a0bbb068c1183fc9fa8 465w","title":"netflix amazon and disney push uk to more than 32m tv streaming customers","story":"Netflix, Amazon, Disney + and others enjoy record year and now have twice as many subscribers as pay-TVThe number of subscribers to the three most popular services in the UK – Netflix, Amazon and Disney+, which demonstrated perfect timing by launching in the UK on the first day of the spring lockdown – will hit 32.4 million by the end of this year. The number of subscribers to streaming services is now double the number signed up to traditional pay-TV providers such as Sky, BT and Virgin Media.The number of streaming subscribers has increased by more than 8 million this year. That is nearly double the number of the next best year, with more than three million people signing up to a service for the first time.“TV has been a pandemic winner and the growth in subscribers shows how important streaming services have now become in the household entertainment mix,” said Richard Broughton, media analyst at Ampere. “Their low monthly cost means that even as many households impacted economically looked to tighten budgets, streaming services flourished.”In just the nine months since its launch, 3.5 million people have signed up to Disney+. The service, whose popularity has been driven by the Star Wars spin-off The Mandalorian, has now passed Sky’s Now TV to become the third most popular streaming service in the UK.Netflix, with 12.8 million subscribers, remains the market leader. Its lockdown crowd-pullers have ranged from Tiger King to The Crown, The Queen’s Gambit and The Last Dance.However, Amazon, which has added Premier League football to its array of content, has closed the gap on Netflix this year and Prime Video now has an estimated 11.4 million users.“Arriving as lockdown hit made for the perfect launch conditions for Disney,” says Broughton. “It was perfectly timed to occupy kids off school while parents were working from home, and of course The Mandalorian has proved a global success story.”Ampere’s figures estimated that the UK’s main pay-TV services – Sky, BT, Virgin Media and TalkTalk – have together lost about 400,000 customers this year.The researchers estimate that there are now 15.8 million UK pay-TV households, or less than half the number now signed up to subscription streaming services.However, pay-TV viewers seem to regard streaming services as an additional service rather than an alternative. Sky, BT, Virgin Media and TalkTalk now all offer the rival streaming services to customers via their set-top boxes.Viewers are simply buying access to more TV at a time when most people have had more time at home, and there are few signs that hard-pressed households have cut back on pay-TV to save money.“The rate of decline in pay-TV subscribers has not accelerated any faster this year than previously,” said Broughton. “We have not really seen customers cutting pay-TV packages to cut costs during the pandemic, or ditching them to only use streaming services.

But our rolling live coverage of the global coronavirus pandemic has continued for almost a year uninterrupted – by Christmas Eve, it will have run 24 hours a day, for 340 days.The coronavirus blog is a perpetual relay. Every morning, as my colleagues in London wrap up their shifts, I launch the new blog and we make the switch (think: swapping the Fabergé egg for the hologram in Ocean’s Twelve, but set at a desk laden with mugs containing various amounts of tea forgotten as the latest news breaks). At the end of the day my computer pings with a friendly message from that day’s designated blogger in London, where it is early morning.While I was packing my suitcases in Lebanon, my colleague Alison Rourke was keeping readers up to date on the very early developments of the virus. At the time, she says, “The world was focused almost entirely on China.”There were hundreds of cases, not tens of millions, and fewer than 50 deaths.“We relied heavily on the Twitter feeds of state-run Chinese media to get a sense of what was going on, as correspondents and journalists were unable to travel to hardest-hit Wuhan,” she says.“Streets in the city of 11 million, where the virus emerged, were empty. People had vanished. At the end of January, the blog published the first videos of residents on high-rise balconies chanting “Wuhan ‘jiāyóu”. Translated literally it means, “add oil” – in other words, “keep up the fight”.By the time I took the reins in early March, the virus had reached 79 countries. Deaths stood at 3,100, cases at 90,000. The World Health Organization was warning of global shortages of personal protective equipment. In Tehran, nurses and doctors danced in full PPE in an effort to keep up morale, as medical workers had done in Wuhan a month earlier.There is a scene in the film LA Confidential that plays in the room in my mind where the pandemic is stored. The corrupt district attorney, Ellis Loew, says of the death of a corrupt policeman, “Maybe he died a hero.” LAPD cop Ed Exley, the film’s protagonist, smiles.“You want to tell me what you’re smiling about?” asks the police chief.“A hero,” Exley responds. “In a situation like this, you’re going to need more than one.”The many heroes of our liveblog are the readers, who write in to let us know how the virus is affecting their countries, send encouragement or – as a purely hypothetical example – let a blogger know that she has written the word “pubic” when she probably meant “public”.Readers also shared their experiences with us – of volunteering for vaccine trials, of being separated from loved ones, and of mourning. The connection with  readers is one of the chief privileges of this job.Then, there is the experience of being on the blog when the president of the most powerful country in the world – and the one with the highest cases and deaths – announces that he has tested positive.When Trump made the announcement on Twitter on 2 October, I began blogging while updating our story with what we knew so far. Because we are working from home, I was fielding phone calls and G-chats – rather than listening to the news and shouts from across the room – while looking for any information possible. As always, it is helpful to not think of the millions of people – my eagle-eyed copy editor of a mother in Cape Town included – waiting to read every post.At the time, the Australian state of Victoria was under one of the longest, strictest lockdowns in the world. In neighbouring New South Wales, life felt almost normal again.A few months later, the US would record 3,000 deaths in one day – more than three times the number of people who have died in Australia over the course of the pandemic so far.I look forward to – hopefully – reporting the good news in next year’s blog of people in developing countries gaining access to vaccines, of family members living in different countries reunited, of healthcare workers finally given the chance to rest. It may be many months until we are publishing those posts, or signing off for the last time. Until then, we’ll be here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a619ceda82de4ca3a4b8ab4a19d82a680c8cb2c/0_0_3488_2092/master/3488.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=90b0ea296194a195f2b2dc6b7bcdb75d","title":"us coronavirus surge holiday christmas travel","story":"Public health experts are cautioning the US to brace for another Covid-19 surge following holiday travel, as the virus continues to spread unchecked throughout the country. “And the reason I’m concerned and my colleagues in public health are concerned also is that we very well might see a post-seasonal, in the sense of Christmas, New Year’s, surge, and, as I have described it, as a surge upon a surge, because, if you look at the slope, the incline of cases that we have experienced as we have gone into the late fall and soon-to-be-early winter, it is really quite troubling,” top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said Sunday on CNN.“We are really at a very critical point.”There have been 19,145,982 cases in the US and 333,140 deaths, Johns Hopkins University’s most recent data indicate Tennessee and California have become the new US centers, with 119.7 and 95.7 people infected per 100,000, respectively.Some estimates predict that US deaths could total 500,000 by spring.US officials are also closely monitoring a coronavirus mutation detected in parts of the UK. While they say that the strain is no more likely to result in serious illness – nor more likely to resist vaccines – it appears to be more contagious.Starting Monday, travelers entering America from the UK must show a negative Covid-19 test within three days of their flight following a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention mandate last week, AP noted.Health officials in Los Angeles said they are testing for the new mutation as COVID-19 cases continue to rise in California. “I wouldn’t be surprised that it’s already here,” Dr.Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, told ABC-7 News.Meanwhile, the vaccine rollout – which has already seen setbacks and controversies – is not expected to happen widely for several months, making near-term relief seem all the more uncertain. While the US goal under Operation Warp Speed was expected to provide vaccine doses to 20 million by year’s end, only around 1.9 million people have received a jab, per CNBC and KVIA.Allegations of fraudulent vaccine distribution have already emerged. New York state authorities have announced a criminal probe into one healthcare provider, alleging that it “may have fraudulently obtained Covid-19 vaccine, transferred it to facilities in other parts of the state in violation of state guidelines and erted it to members of the public,” according to the New York Post.President-elect Joe Biden has also warned that the US pandemic is poised to get far worse before it gets better.“One thing I promise you about my leadership during this crisis: I’m going to tell it to you straight. I’m going to tell you the truth. And here’s the simple truth: our darkest days in the battle against Covid are ahead of us, not behind us,” Biden recently said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4446547.1609171871!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit duty free makes a come back for travellers returning from britain","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDuty-free between Ireland and Britain was abolished 21 years ago as it was not considered compatible with the emerging single market.

However with the UK now leaving the EU and its single market from the start next year the old rules are set to revert. Airports and ports in Ireland as well as ferry companies and airlines will be optimistic their ability to sell duty free products to passengers travelling to and from Britain will offer them a much-needed additional revenue stream as they continue to struggle with the pandemic which has been, by any measure, the single greatest crisis to hit the modern travel industry, The new duty-free rules will not, however, apply to people travelling between Northern Ireland and the Republic. While duty free sales for passengers travelling within the EU were abolished in the late 1990s, they remained for all non-EU destinations. Speaking this week, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Leo Varadkar said duty free would be on offer to travellers once flights resume. A ban on flights and ferries from Britain into the Republic is in place until December 31st due to a new more-contagious strain of the Covid-19 .“There will be duty free when we can start flying again between Britain and Ireland,” Mr Varadkar said. That does not, however, mean Irish people will have unfettered access to cheaper cigarettes and alcohol. According to Revenue, people travelling from non-EU countries can bring in goods free of duty and tax if their combined value is no more than €430 if the passenger is 15 or over or €215 if they are under 15. Technically, then, a family of two adults and two children returning from a weekend in the British capital could bring in a total of €1,290 as long as they could ide it up as necessary. In addition to a duty-free allowance for general goods, travellers will have allowances for alcohol and tobacco products. Those allowance permit 200 cigarettes, 100 cigarillos, 50 cigars or 250g of smoking tobacco.Under Revenue’s rules people will be allowed one litre of spirits or two litres of other alcoholic drinks with no more than 22 per cent alcohol . These might include port, sherry, sparkling wine and some liqueursUp to four litres of wine and 16 litres of beer will also be exempt from duty under the new post-Brexit rules.

Photograph: David JonesPA WireThe taxpayer subsidised private schools by more than €100 million this year, according to official figures.The vast bulk went on salaries for teachers and special needs assistants in the State’s 51 fee-paying schools, along with capital expenditure and grants for Covid-related costs such as cleaning and additional supervision.There was controversy when it emerged that private schools would not have automatic access to a special Covid-related fund for reopening schools.However, a change in policy resulted in fee-charging schools receiving a total of €2 million in grants to reconfigure classrooms and purchase personal protective equipment. The figures come at a time when student numbers in fee-charging schools continue to rise steadily.Latest enrolment statistics show numbers attending private schools have climbed to more than 25,800 pupils, the highest total on record.While numbers slipped during the recession, with some private schools opting to enter the free education scheme, enrolments in the fee-paying sector are back at levels last seen during the economic boom.The boarding sector is also enjoying continuing growth in enrolments, with 3,584 students boarding in 2020.Fees frozenAn  survey shows most fee-charging schools have frozen their admission fees this year in response to financial uncertainty facing families due to the pandemic.St Columba’s in Dublin remains the most expensive day school in the country, at €8,654 this year.It is followed by Sutton Park, Dublin 13 (€7,995) Cistercian College in Roscrea (€7,550) Alexandra College, Dublin 6 (€7,534), The King’s Hospital, Co Dublin (€7,475) and St Gerard’s, Bray, Co Wicklow (€7,420).Among boarding schools, St Columba’s is also the most expensive (up to €23,952) followed by Clongowes Wood College, Co Kildare (€20,2980) Rathdown School, Glenageary (€19,625) and Glenstal Abbey, Co Limerick (€19,300).New figures also show most private schools – especially those in the Dublin area – are heavily oversubscribed and have long waiting lists for places.Under new admissions legislation, schools are required to publish annual notices disclosing the number of places available for applicants. Admissions figures show private schools and high-performing non-fee-paying schools turned away hundreds of applicants in 2020.Oversubscribed schoolsLoreto College, a fee-paying secondary school on St Stephen’s Green in Dublin, was five times oversubscribed. It received 502 applications for its 100 available first-year places.Belvedere College, a fee-paying school on Great Denmark Street in Dublin, was more than three times oversubscribed. It received 550 applications for its 168 first-year places.Gonzaga College, a fee-paying school in Ranelagh, was twice oversubscribed with 182 applications for 86 places.Blackrock College was twice oversubscribed, although applications to first year are made to Willow Park Senior School. This school reported 407 applications for 208 available places.Similarly, Castleknock College was almost twice oversubscribed, with a total of 238 applications for 120 places in first year.Many schools in the non-fee-charging sector are also heavily oversubscribed, especially those in more affluent areas.For example, Muckross Park College, a second-level non-fee-paying school for girls in Donnybrook, Dublin 4, was one of the oversubscribed secondary schools, according to available figures.It had a total of 720 applications this year for just 120 first-year places, or six times the number of available place.Mount Temple Comprehensive School, a non-fee-paying school in Dublin 3, was almost three times oversubscribed.

Photograph: Toms KalninsEPAThe first doses of the PfizerBioNTech Covid-19 vaccine are to be administered in Ireland in four acute hospitals on Tuesday.Initially, the plan had been to go directly to nursing homes, but the National Immunisation Advisory Committee said it would prefer the first tranche be given in healthcare settings after some reports of anaphylaxis, an allergic reaction, in the UK and the United States. The plan is to vaccinate 20,000 people a week from early January, with this increasing to 40,000 over the course of the month as supply comes on stream. Where am I in the queue? Older residents in long-term residential care facilities, such as nursing homes, and frontline healthcare workers will be prioritised. After that will be: people aged 70 and above other healthcare workers people aged 65-69 key workers people at risk due to medical conditions and those living or working in crowded conditions. This will be followed by people working in education those aged 55-64 workers in other occupations important to the functioning of society people aged between 18 and 54 and, finally, pregnant women and those under 18. How will it work? When each cohort is being vaccinated people will be required to register online or by phone, and will be given a scheduled appointment at a vaccination centre or other location. Upon arrival the details of the patient will be confirmed, and they will fill in a consent form before receiving the injection into their upper arm. They will be required to wait for 15 minutes to allow staff monitor for any immediate adverse reactions to the drug. The required second dose of the vaccine will be administered 21 days later, with a reminder sent for the second appointment. Should I expect any side effects? The Health Service Executive has said common side effects may include muscle pains, headaches, tiredness or swelling in the upper arm. Often people can develop a fever after a vaccination, particularly after the second dose. The fever can develop after 48 hours and normally lasts for about two days. How will it work in nursing homes? The HSE’s plan to inoculate the 70,000 residents and staff in the vulnerable nursing-home sector will begin on January 11th, with small numbers of vaccinations taking place in care homes before this date. It is expected to take until the end of February to administer two doses of the vaccine across more than 580 facilities. A team of vaccinators will arrive on site to deliver the vaccine in a dedicated area of the nursing home. Smaller nursing homes with 30 residents or fewer will require one team of four vaccinators, with all doses delivered in a day, and the second dose 21 days later. Larger facilities with more than 120 residents will likely need three days to deliver the vaccine per dose. Who will be administering the vaccines? All vaccinators will be qualified healthcare professionals. While the process is relatively straightforward, the vaccinators are to receive specific training in the delivery of the Covid-19 vaccines. In the initial phase when vaccine supplies are limited the programme will be led by 180 community healthcare vaccinators, who run the HSE schools vaccination programme. The HSE has said a further 1,500 vaccinators are to become available in the acute hospital system as the roll-out plan picks up pace. What about GPs and pharmacists? General practitioners and pharmacists will form part of the vaccination plan only after the initial phase covering frontline healthcare workers and residential care homes. When large numbers of doses become available the second phase will see the vaccine delivered via GP clinics, pharmacies and mass vaccination centres. Current Covid-19 swabbing centres may be repurposed as large vaccination sites, such as the National Exhibition Centre in Cloghran, north county Dublin.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State Papers: British feared IRA could continue campaign of violence indefinitely-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4446485.1609177636!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu ambassadors give green light to brexit trade deal with uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUK border signs are pictured at the passport control in Arrivals in Terminal 2 at Heathrow Airport in London. Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas AFP via Getty ImagesBritain’s trade and co-operation agreement with the European Union has moved a step closer to ratification after EU ambassadors in Brussels approved it unanimously. By 1pm on Tuesday, the 27 member state governments will agree in writing to implement the deal provisionally from New Year’s Day, pending ratification by the European Parliament a few weeks later.The leaders of the parliament’s political groups said on Monday that they would consult the European Commission and the member states about extending MEPs’ scrutiny of the agreement beyond the end of February. MPs and peers at Westminster will debate the agreement on Wednesday with votes in both houses the same day on legislation to give effect to it under British law.A “star chamber” of lawyers charged by the European Research Group (ERG) of Conservative Brexiteers with scrutinising the deal will give its verdict before the start of Wednesday’s debate. But a number of Eurosceptic hardliners have already signalled their satisfaction with the deal’s protection of British sovereignty.“This proposed agreement clearly rules out any future jurisidiction or control by the European Court of Justice over the UK,” former minister John Redwood said.“As it is important to protect our sovereignty from any future attempted infringements by the EU acting under this agreement, it is also crucial that there is an easy exit clause. This was something I lobbied for strongly. Financial Provision 8 headed ‘Termination’ gives a simple clean exit.”The provision states that either party may terminate the agreement at 12 months’ notice.Boris Johnson spoke on Monday with European Council president Charles Michel, telling him he welcomed the deal as a new starting point for the relationship between Britain and the EU.“We looked forward to the formal ratification of the agreement and to working together on shared priorities, such as tackling climate change,” the prime minister said.Le Figaro interviewIn the hours after the agreement was reached on Christmas Eve, members of the British negotiating team briefed against EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, whom they said had been sidelined by commission president Ursula von der Leyen.In an interview with Le Figaro, Mr Barnier dismissed the claim, saying it had never been his role to negotiate with the British prime minister and that Dr Von der Leyen’s predecessor Jean-Claude Juncker had also played a more prominent role towards the end of talks on the withdrawal agreement.He said the negotiations with Britain had persuaded politicians and voters in other European countries that leaving the EU was not a good idea, adding that the agreement would amplify that message.“These negotiations have reinforced the conviction of leaders and citizens that it is better to be together rather than on one’s own,” he said.\u0026nbsp“There are true differences between a member country and a third country. We will see it pretty soon.”He said the agreement had strong measures to ensure that Britain, which threatened during the recent negotiations to renege on the withdrawal agreement, will play by the rules.“From the experience we have had we built in safeguards that are necessary to make sure there is a strong incentive for both sides to stick to what they have agreed to,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Remko De WaalEPAThe position of Dutch authorities was that only people with symptoms could transmit coronavirus. It was repeated by the government, national and local health authorities, justifying a cascade of decisions that allowed the Netherlands to keep up a “business as usual” attitude even as the virus exponentially spread.The problem was, it was wrong. As early as February 21st, Chinese doctors published a case of apparent asymptomatic transmission German doctors wrote to the New England Journal of Medicine on March 5th to warn of a case near Munich. The World Health Organisation advises transmission without symptoms is possible.Despite this the Dutch government and health authorities stuck to looser quarantine advice than other European countries up to the time of publishing, telling people who had travelled from China, outbreak spots in Italy, and Iran, that they need only self-quarantine if experiencing symptoms.As well as being underpinned by a flawed assumption, the advice relies on people knowing whether they have symptoms or not. This is questionable: Chris Higgins, a GP in Australia, provoked an outcry after treating 70 patients while he had what he thought was the tail end of a mild cold, before he tested positive for Covid-19.It’s also in stark contrast to the approach in the countries most successful at containing the virus, such as Taiwan and Singapore, where authorities drew on their experience of the Sars outbreak to implement strict travel checks and preventative quarantine before even registering a first confirmed case.Inidual freedomsThe case of the Netherlands shows how a flawed belief about transmission filtered down throughout society, enabling the virus to spread. It also makes for a grand experiment in what happens when a country takes a relaxed approach to the virus, placing the maintenance of normality, personal responsibility and inidual freedoms first.The first coronavirus diagnosis in the Netherlands was on February 27th. As authorities traced his contacts, they found he had attended Carnival in the city of Tilburg in the North Brabant region on February 21st-25th. “The patient was not contagious in the days he celebrated the carnival,” the mayor of Tilburg Theo Weterings told media.In the following days, two more people who were at Tilburg carnival were diagnosed with coronavirus. One of them was a worker at Bannink Packaging in Drenthe in the northern Netherlands. His partner was also infected.\u0026nbspBannink Packaging continued to operate as normal, saying the employee was not sick when he came to work. “The chance that he has infected colleagues is therefore rather small,” the spokesperson told media.On March 4th, another Bannink Packaging employee – who commuted from Germany – was diagnosed with coronavirus.\u0026nbsp“In Germany they are a lot stricter with testing . . . We should not exaggerate. Production continues as normal. In that respect, it is business as usual,” a company representative told media. “We advise our employees to stay at home if they have symptoms. We cannot do more.”On March 5th a third employee was diagnosed as positive.\u0026nbspOn March 7th four more people tested positive in Coevorden, where Bannink Packaging is based.That day 900 students of the university society Vindicat returned from a mass ski trip in Piedmont in northern Italy in a convoy of buses to the Netherlands. Amid public concern, authorities met the students and tested four, who were found negative.“Someone who has no symptoms is not contagious,” Jossy van den Boogaard, MD in infectious disease control at local health authority GGD Groningen told media.“Can the students also infect others while they have no symptoms? No,” was the official advice. “What if someone decides to go to work or take an exam? This is their own responsibility.”No panicOn March 8th it was announced that a cleaning lady married to a Bannink Packaging employee had tested positive. The director of the school she works at wrote to parents to say there was no reason to panic, and that children could go to school as normal.By this point the outbreak in the carnival region of North Brabant had reached the point that there were shortages of protective equipment for health workers, and people were advised not to call their doctor unless their symptoms were serious.Lawmaker Eva van Esch told parliament a friend of hers had tested positive who had been refused a test for a week after returning from Italy with symptoms. Once positive, the friend had been asked to keep the diagnosis quiet and not to tell her work or contacts, van Esch said.“My party therefore wonders whether this government is actually focusing on preventing the spread of the disease, or whether the health services are primarily concerned with preventing panic,” van Esch said.Dutch testing capacity is limited, forcing authorities to prioritise testing people with a clear link. Roughly 6,000 tests had been done in the Netherlands as of March 7th, national public health institute the RIVM said, a figure that includes double-testing to exclude false positives, and testing for recovery.Twelve days after the first diagnosis, confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the Netherlands had risen from 1 to 382.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"dark decade coming fox news predicts newsmax ceo amid scramble","story":"For much of the Trump presidency there has been something close to a mind-meld between Rupert Murdoch’s conservative cable news channel and the Oval Office occupant.Mr Trump did endless interviews with Fox News, more than any other media outlet. He hired Fox executives to his White House. The channel\u0027s biggest stars in turn backed his stances and echoed his attacks. Aides took to the airways to decry the move as premature. Mr Trump reportedly called Mr Murdoch directly to demand the call be retracted. Yet on the night and beyond it remained shaded Democratic blue. In the weeks that followed Mr Trump railed against Fox. “Can’t believe how badly Fox News is doing in the ratings,” the president also said in that December 16 tweet. “Really sad!”That dynamic, of the most prominent Republican politician in America publicly turning his back on Fox - even while still doing interviews - has opened the gap for other right-of-centre outlets. One in particular seems well-placed to capitalise: Newsmax. The business was launched in 1998 with a deliberate attempt to offer heartland America a conservative take on the news, especially politics. So too online:  reported the number of Facebook user \u0027interactions\u0027 with Newsmax on the site jumped from 500,000 a week at the start of 2020 to 7.3 million in the first week of November.Part of the channel’s success has come from giving airtime to Trumpworld stars. Sean Spicer, the president’s first press secretary who has remained loyal to his former boss, has a show. So too do Diamond and Silk, two African-American political bloggers turned activists who have built a deep following in the Trump support base, often appearing at his rallies. Newsmax also has old connections to Britain’s conservative movement. William Rees-Mogg, the former Times editor and father of Tory House of Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg, was a founding chairman of the company. For now, overtaking Fox News in TV viewing figures seems some distance away. The channel remains dominant in prime-time evening ratings, even amid a wobble post-election. But the fracturing of the conservative US media ecosystem, accelerated by Mr Trump hammering away at the cracks, looks set to be a trend in the years to come. “It’s a dark world for Fox going forward over the next 10 years,” Mr Ruddy predicted, appearing to relish his status as the underdog. “A very dark world.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ditch dry january ditch veganuary pandemic no time joyless puritanism","story":"This is the fourth day of Christmas, and I can’t remember another year when festivity – minus parties – is more timely. Christmas pudding is as welcome now as on Christmas Day Irish hot whiskey (with lemon and cloves) ditto sausage rolls and mulled cider… bring them on! In a time of pandemic and bereavement, there is little to cheer us up so much as eating and drinking a little to excess, even if only in our household bubbles. Think Pickwick Papers, think hot punch, think mince pies.It is also time to ditch the most egregiously unseasonal, life-denying trend of recent years, the move to turn January into a time of self-denial. Yes, I mean Dry January. I mean Veganuary. Ditch them both. Keep up the celebrations as they used to be kept, in full swing until January 6, the Epiphany, and in a rather lower-key, all the way to Candlemas, on February 2.Do we need reminding why January is the worst time to give things up? This year, we need cheering up. People have died, businesses have gone under, we can’t meet our friends. This is no time for abstinence. It’s a time for embracing starchy carbs and a cheering drink – in moderation. Whether you’re a port or snowball person, there are moments you need just a little inebriating uplift, and that time is now. You also need proper food.Abstinence in January is rubbish any year. Did you hear the storm? When outside is so depressing, you want to make inside as cheerful as possible… and that doesn’t mean a diet. It’s still Christmas. So sucks to abstinence. Give the New Year, New You a miss if it means joyless restraint. We need all the comfort we can get. Remember, February is the new January.So, the Queen’s Christmas message to the nation was watched by more people than anything else in the TV schedule. I wish that were higher praise.Pundits have hailed the Queen’s inclusivity, her line about everyone needing a hug. What I got out of it was the Queen’s spirited bid to bring Christianity into Christmas. She registered two scriptural themes in her address – Christ as the light in the darkness and the Good Samaritan, who went out of his way to help someone he didn’t have anything in common with.The Queen is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England and it’s touching the way she uses the one chance she has to do religion. Every single year, she talks about Christ in her Christmas broadcast every single year the BBC et al filter the message out in their post-broadcast reporting. I see the Queen as a lay preacher, someone who tries to spread her own simple faith. It’s hard to see her son or grandson doing the same. Good for her.Some good has come out of the dire Maggi Hambling statue of Mary Wollstonecroft, and that is that people are resolved that the long-planned statue of Virginia Woolf shall actually look like her. Thank goodness. There have been some awful statues of eminent public figures… and yes, I am thinking of the one of Oscar Wilde near the Strand, which would have made him cry.There are some excellent figurative sculptors out there – the Society of Portrait Sculptors is full of them. Please can we go to them for poor Mrs Woolf, rather than a celebrity who is too grand to show an eminent subject in a way that’s actually recognisable?

Politics has changed: Remain is now the peripheral position. The question Labour faces is, should it just accept Brexit or embrace it? I’d urge the latter, for two reasons.First, Brexit makes the argument for social democracy, and its construction, a little easier. Many Tories wanted to leave the EU as a means of reducing the size of the state recall Mrs Thatcher’s warning at Bruges in 1988 that Britain hadn’t defeated socialism at home only to have it imposed from overseas. But Brexit in practice is so disruptive that it justifies more state intervention, not less. No-deal preparations hinged on the Government promising to subsidise affected industries, and a mix of Covid cash and redevelopment money might soften the blow of compromises made in the trade deal for fishing towns.State aid played a big role in the talks because the economy is changing and the UK wants the flexibility to support emerging industries (the plan seems to be to turn the Highlands into Cape Canaveral). Remainers were also wrong when they presupposed that liberation from regulatory alignment would mean Britain will weaken its rules: to assuage those very fears, the Tories are talking about strengthening them, starting with animal welfare. The tone of our politics is shifting to the centre‑Left, towards themes of solidarity and investment, and Boris Johnson won his majority because he moved with it, offering a brand of patriotic social democracy that isn’t a million miles from Old Labour.New Labour’s gamble that Europe would quietly impose social reform that English voters might otherwise stonewall was naive in a series of essays for the London Review of Books, Perry Anderson has built the case for the opposite. Among the revelations is that the founding judges on the European Court of Justice included fascist collaborators, that the ECJ’s landmark case asserting the supremacy of European law was in protest at an act of nationalisation, and that the court has ruled against the interests of trade unions. The effect of “constitutionalising… issues like the permissibility of state aid”, writes Anderson, has been to protect judicial decrees “against any ordinary exercise of the popular will”, a legal barrier to democratic socialism.Secondly, just as Brexit is a chance for Britain to become more like Britain, it could help Labour rediscover itself. The old Marx vs Methodism argument is trite. What distinguished Labour from many continental movements was its ability to accommodate both: to be materialist and spiritual, internationalist and parochial.Again, have no fear, the trend of British politics is internationalist: we will have to trade to grow and, with Joe Biden in the White House, we can expect global cooperation on climate and China. But the referendum summoned ghosts of a time when Labour MPs were pro-world and romantically in love with their own country. As Peter Shore said in that famous Oxford debate of 1975, the pro-Common Market position was a vote against Britain’s ability to run itself.My politics has been all over the place for 20 years, but even as a socialist I was anti-EU, and the disdain that many Labourites felt for working‑class patriotism is one of the things that drove me to the Right. Sir Keir jumping on the Brexit bus is sweet victory come too late for me, but all power to those Labourites motivated by sentimental, nation-state socialism. The dream of building Jerusalem on this island west of Brussels only makes sense if you believe, as I do, that the Lamb of God would choose to walk upon it, that it is blessed with a great and good people, more than capable of managing their own affairs.It’s been an unusual Christmas. My mother got engrossed in Court TV, in the trial of a man who murdered his parents because they threatened to cut off his allowance. I called it “justifiable homicide” and she was in a mood with me for a week.One of my presents was a personalised celebrity video message starring the actress Rula Lenska. Looking fabulous, she said “I hear you’re a fan of Doctor Who and Cluedo” and that I’m writing a book, so she wished me a merry Christmas and the best of luck for the new year. I rang my friend and said: “How did you know it was exactly what I wanted?!”The website where you can order one of these videos is fascinating: prices for a celeb greeting range from lows of £15 (Grange Hill’s Zammo) to north of £60 (Boycie from Only Fools and Horses). Sylvester McCoy charges the surprisingly specific rate of £78.It’s like a celebrity stock market (Vicki Michelle is currently trading at £3 more than Toyah) and the source, one imagines, of considerable professional jealousy. Coronation Street’s Ken Barlow is £45 and yet Billy, the gay vicar, just 30 quid. If he finally dumped Paul for Todd, like I keep saying he should, the troubled cleric could probably charge as much as Jet from Gladiators.I was too much of a gentleman to look at Ms Lenska’s price. Suffice to say that she’s worth every penny and could make the Yellow Pages sound sexy. Maybe I should get in on this game, I said to Mum? “How much do you think I should charge?”“Two ninety-nine,” she replied, still angry about the homicide gag.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"now everyone wants lead us yazidis face political fracture wake","story":"As leader of one of the world\u0027s most persecuted minorities, Hazim Tahseen Bek has kept count of how his people have nearly been wiped out. The prince of Iraq\u0027s Yazidis claims it has happened scores of times over history, the culprits ranging from ancient Muslim tribes through to the Ottoman Turks and Saddam Hussein.Then, in 2014, came the Islamic State, whose campaign of genocide brought a medieval barbarity to the 21st century.It was shocking that something like this could happen in this day and age, Mr Bek told the Daily  from his home in the town of Ba\u0027adra, overlooking Iraq\u0027s Nineveh Plains. But it was not the first time we have been attacked in this way.Last month marked the fifth anniversary of the liberation of Sinjar, the Yazidi city that bore the brunt of the IS onslaught, in which around 5,000 men were slaughtered and more than 6,000 women abducted for use as sex slaves.Five years on, the wounds are still fresh. Much of Sinjar remains in ruins, many Yazidis languish in refugee camps, and nearly half the abducted women are still missing. But as Mr Bek steers his people out of one existential crisis, he is also confronting another - this time thrust upon him by fellow Yazidis, for whom 2014 has also led to profound questions about their political leadership.For the first time in centuries, bitter isions have spilled out into the open, with different groups vying for power, and the 1,000-year-old monarchy itself facing calls for reform.Now it feels like anyone who wears military clothes and has a weapon feels he can have a say in our community, Mr Bek said. They are affecting our unity, and interfering in matters that are not their business.Mr Bek, 56, spoke while sitting next to a statue of a peacock - the traditional depiction of the Yazidi arch-angel Melek Taus.In Yazidi religion - which blends Christian, Zoroastrian and ancient Mesopotamian beliefs - Taus was expelled from Heaven, before his tears of remorse extinguished the fires of Hell. Other religions have often confused Taus\u0027s story with that of Satan, leading to the Yazidis being persecuted over the centuries as devil-worshippers.Even the secular Saddam Hussein repressed them, forcing them to identify as Arabs rather than Kurds during his campaign to Arabise Iraq\u0027s Kurdish north. For centuries, such horrors convinced Yazidis that the only way to survive in Iraq was to keep a low profile, as did Christians and other religious minorities.The prince, or emir, ruled quietly in tandem with a spiritual leader, the so-called Baba Sheikh, upholding a conservative, inward-looking elite.  All that has come under challenge in the wake of the genocide, which has seen the once tight-knit community exposed to outside influences. Mr Bek is concerned, for example, about the PKK, a Left-wing Kurdish militia group.They came to the aid of the Yazidis in Sinjar when Kurdish regional government troops fled the IS advance, leaving the city defenceless. Initially welcomed as saviours, the PKK have now recruited many Yazidis to their cause, which preaches a radical, Left-wing agenda that is at odds with the traditional Yazidi outlook.Also challenging the status quo are Western NGOs, many of them keen to promote women’s rights in the wake of IS\u0027s atrocities.The genocide has further opened a schism between the Yazidis in Sinjar, who suffered IS\u0027s horrors, and the royal elite, whose base in Ba\u0027adra, which lies in territory controlled by Iraq\u0027s Kurdish regional government, was not attacked.Some Sinjar Yazidis distrust Mr Bek because he served as an MP with the regional government\u0027s ruling KDP party, which they claim should have done more to stop Sinjar falling into IS\u0027s hands.Discontent first surfaced last year, when Mr Bek took over from his late father, who ruled for seven decades and died without nominating a successor. Critics said Mr Bek was chosen ahead of several other candidates without proper consultation with the wider community.We were hoping for a more democratic selection process that would have let people have their say, said Ahmed Burjus, deputy director of Yazda, a Yazidi non-profit organisation set up in the wake of the genocide.One reason the prince was chosen was because he has support from the main KDP party. But that\u0027s like having a Queen of Britain who is Conservative or Labour.A Sinjar-based claimant to the throne even declared himself prince in a rival ceremony, allegedly instigated by the PKK.  Further discord broke out last month, when the new Baba Sheikh, Ali Elias, was inaugurated at Lalish, a mountain temple that is the Yazidis\u0027 holiest site.Some in Sinjar boycotted the event, again claiming that Mr Bek, who oversees the appointment, had not consulted widely enough. Mr Bek has already tried to address the isions, setting up a new community council that is designed to give Sinjar Yazidis more of a voice.But for some Yazidis, far more sweeping reforms are now needed. A more engaged, accountable leadership, they say, is vital - not just to stop genocide ever happening again, but to end the rifts it has left.The prince should be a symbolic position like it is in Britain, and we should have a democratically-elected body to lead Yazidis everywhere, says Khalil Jindy Rashow, a Yazidi writer. The Yazidi wound is now too big to be healed otherwise.Mr Burjus also points out that unless Iraq achieves a lasting peace, the 500,000 strong Yazidi community may dwindle further. Around a fifth have already fled abroad in the wake of the genocide - and those who remain will need little encouragement to follow.Even if we have political representation, there are still other religious parties in the system here who believe that we are infidels, he said. All it requires is another atrocity against us - be it a genocide or a car bomb - and all Yazidis will flee the land.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"should politicians allowed get vaccine first","story":"Like an achingly slow-motion version of Santa Claus whizzing around the world to deliver pressies to the good kids who made it on to his nice list, the coronavirus vaccine has finally reached Europe’s capitals.And so we have been treated to the now familiar but somehow still touching images of pensioners and healthcare workers rolling up their sleeves to receive their first dose of the magic substance we all hope will soon allow us to party like it’s 2019.Among those making it on to the nice list for the vaccine in Greece were President Katerina Sakellaropoulou and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, while Italy’s first three doses went to healthcare workers.Gertrude Haase, age 101, was first in line to receive the jab in Germany, and France gave the honour to a 78-year-old resident of a nursing home near Paris.Europe’s somewhat varied decision-making over determining who gets the vaccine and when highlights the scattergun approach which seems to have been taken the world over to deciding where our priorities lie when it comes to keeping people safe from Covid-19.As in Greece, should we be protecting our politicians and leaders, both as an example to the rest of the population to ease fears about the vaccine’s safety and because the men and women who lead us are too precious to lose an hour or a day, let alone their life, to a rogue virus?This seems to be the view in the United States, where President-Elect Joe Biden, Vice President Mike Pence and half of Congress have now received the jab. Saudi Arabia’s 35- year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was vaccinated on Friday, and Russia’s Vladimir Putin is due to get his country’s Sputnik shot any day now.Given the propensity of world leaders from Boris Johnson and Donald Trump to Emmanuel Macron of France, Canada’s Justin Trudeau and Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil to catch Covid (Ambrose Dlamini, prime minister of the African nation of Eswatini, is even thought to have died from the virus) perhaps it’s no bad thing they should be first in line.So are these nations right? Should NHS staff and care home workers, the elderly and infirm, stand aside to allow MPs and peers to get the jab first in the UK too?That doesn’t feel quite right. We entrust health workers to keep the rest of us safe, expect them to risk their lives to do so we spent months clapping their heroics, shouldn’t we show them how valuable they are by keeping them healthy as they continue their unenviable task?And residents of care homes, the places that bore the brunt of the first wave of the pandemic last spring, when the virus swept through facilities the world over leaving a terrible trail of sickness and death, are we really comfortable keeping them in danger as a third and fourth wave hit?By far the biggest determinate of who lives and dies after testing positive for Covid is age research published by America’s Centre for Disease Control shows eight out of 10 of those who lost their lives to the pandemic in the US were over-65, while people aged 85 and over were 13 times more likely than 18 to 35-year-olds to be hospitalised and 630 times more likely to die.Yet perhaps there does seem something off-kilter about using up a precious dose of vaccine to give a 103-year-old what will likely be only a few more months of life ahead of, say, a sprightly 70-year-old with decades left in them. Might there not be more discussion around whether some of the very elderly, those in their late 90s and older, really desire to take the jab, or whether they might show their bravery and selflessness, not by getting the vaccine, as has been the narrative thus far but – always voluntarily – by insisting someone else might be better placed to receive it?There will be plenty who would flinch at the suggestion their parent, their grandmother or grandfather, give away their chance of keeping safe for even a few short extra months. On balance, they should not even be asked to do so.Because every life is precious, and we all have people we are desperate to keep alive. And that is why world leaders who consider their own lives more valuable than those of the rest of us have got this one wrong.They may consider themselves indispensable – but hopefully we’re all indispensable to someone.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit trade deal 15 details","story":"NewsBrexit trade deal:  details buried in the small print of ,-page pactThe deal comes into effect on January , and prevents tarfs or quotas on £ billion a year of trade.

But since the ,-page legal text was published on Boxing Day, some awkward details have begun to emerge in small print. Fishing groups have accused Boris Johnson of betraying them - while there are blank spaces for industries like the City. There are, of course, many things that will happen on January  despite the deal - and weaposve detailed them here. But what about in the small print of the deal itself  Here are  of the most curious or awkward nuggets that have been spotted so far. What do you think of the deal  Let us know in the comments section below. . British farmers face a sausage ban on selling into the EU British chilled mince and sausages will be banned from being exported into the EU after January , the government says. Negotiators had been hoping for a wider pact to allow chilled meat preparations to be moved between the UK and EU. But the Brexit deal makes clear that, while there will be some co-operation, the EU and UK will each have their own sanitary rules. And government guidance to British businesses, updated on December , bluntly says you will not be able to export chilled mince, chilled raw sausages, ungraded eggs or some unpasteurised milk into the EU. In Northern Ireland a six-month transition period will allow chilled mince and sausages to keep being moved from Britain to Belfast until the end of June . But after that there is still no firm arrangement for Irish Sea trade. Katy Hayward, of the UK in a Changing Europe think tank, said in essence thereaposs no way of getting those chilled meat products into Northern Ireland after July . A Trade Specialised Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures will be able to clary rules and rule on disputes, so changes are possible in future. Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association, told the Mirror he hoped the problems would be solved in the coming months. He added most exports of such goods were to Northern Ireland not the EU. But he added: For some people itaposs quite a signicant blow. Some businesses will have developed a trade around it and they wonapost be able to do it. The government has been contacted for further comment.  . Fishing boats are facing aposbetrayalapos Boris Johnson has been accused of “betraying” the fishing industry over the small print of his Brexit deal. The Prime Minister boasted his ,-page pact would make Britain an “independent coastal state with full control of our waters”. He said it would hand around % of the value of the EU’s current catch in UK waters back to UK fishermen by summer . But the small print of his deal reveals changes in quotas y dramatically depending on which species is being caught in which part of the sea. The UK share of cod West of Scotland will soar from .% to .% by  - taking back % of what EU boats currently catch in the area.  But the UK will only take back % of the EU’s catch of sole in the Western Channel, off the coast of Cornwall. For other species, such as Northern Prawn in the North Sea, the UK EU quotas will remain unchanged. The PM also said after , there was “no theoretical limit” on what British boats could land. But after , EU fishing in UK waters won’t end - instead there will be annual negotiations over what is caught. The deal says those negotiations should normally lead to each side getting a quota thataposs reasonably commensurate with what they had before. Andthe UK acts unfairly, the EU can take “compensatory measures” or - in the worst case scenario - collapse the trade deal entirely. . The whole deal could come crashing down after four years  The whole trade deal can be reviewed after four years and could - in a worst-case scenario - be axed. A No spokesman said: If the UK or EU does not believe the system is working fairly, either side will have the ability to bring the agreement on trade to an end. “The UK and EU would then trade on Australian-style terms.” This means having no Brexit deal at all. There are several ways the deal could be terminated. Those includeeither side decides to terminate the agreement on fishing, the rest of the trade elements of the pact would come crashing down as well. . Erasmus is coming to an end  The UK has quit the Erasmus student exchange programme after Brexit, complaining it is too “expensive”. The scheme allows UK university students to study abroad in one of  participating nations. Some can get a “large contribution” to their tuition fees back in the UK as well as a grant of up to € a month. But Boris Johnson complained the programme, which the UK joined in , was “extremely expensive”. He announced the UK will launch a replacement programme named after Enigma codebreaker Alan Turing. The Prime Minister boasted the new ‘Turing Scheme’ will allow students to study at universities across the world, not just Europe. The scheme would cost around £m, open for bids for , places starting in September , and be open to schools, colleges and universities. But Universities UK said leaving Erasmus was “disappointing” and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said it was one of his only two regrets. Scotlandaposs First Minister Nicola Sturgeon branded it an act of cultural vandalism. . Youaposll still need travel insurance - despite a health deal  Brits have been warned they must still get full travel insurance for trips to the EU from January  - despite the deal. The ,-page agreement says Brits can continue to get emergency healthcare while on holiday, like they can under the European Health Insurance Card. People’s current EHICs will continue to be valid until they expire. They will then be replaced with a UK Global Health Insurance Card . The UK is in talks about further co-operation with non-EU states Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. But despite this, Brits are being warned they must get comprehensive cover anywaythey are planning a trip to the continent. Officials say that is because EHICs only ever covered certain types of healthcare - in other words, emergency or necessary care. The Brexit deal doesn’t cover Brits who travel to an EU country “with the purpose of receiving” healthcare - except for a limited number of exemptions. Britainaposs car plants have been saved in the short term by the Brexit deal - which stops car exports to the EU being hit with % tarfs. It also guarantees car makers can use parts from within both the UK and EU without triggering extra tarfs. However, there will be limits on how many parts a factory can source from outside Europe completely. If a car was assembled in Sunderland but made of % Japanese parts, it would count as Japanese and be hit with the % tarf. Under the Brexit deal, these rules of origin will be phased in. So the UKaposs hybrid cars for example will only need a minimum of % local content at first to avoid tarfs, but this will rise to % from  and % from . The UK government said the rates are enough to ensure UK-made electric vehicles are eligible for preferential tarf rates. But Prof David Bailey, of the UK in a Changing Europe think tank, said it was a compromise because the UK asked for more. He added: This could still be tight for some manufacturers when it comes to batteries or high value hybrid systems from outside the EU. Toyota, for example, might struggle to qualy its UK assembled hybrids for tarf free export to the EU – although it has time to increase local content, such as via its UK engine plant. . And thereaposs a four-year paper trail There will be hefty audit rules for car makers and other businesses who have to prove the origin of their parts. This could add costs and bureaucracy to businesses which, in some cases, are already struggling. The Brexit deal says exporters whoaposve declared the origin of their goods will keep copies of all records for a minimum of four years. . Financial services are in the dark  The trade agreement is mostly about rules for goods crossing the border - it is less clear when it comes to the trade in services. The deal contains a commitment to work to build closer arrangements, but it hasnapost secured the same level of access as pre-Brexit. For many British companies, this will prove a major headache with the true extent of how dficult or not the deal will be for services set to play out in the coming years. Boris Johnson admitted the language on the City was perhaps not as much as we would have liked but the deal would enable our dynamic City of London to get on and prosper as never before. However, Prof Sarah Hall of the UK in a Changing Europe think thank warned: UK based financial services firms will either have to comply with the dferent requirements of inidual member states or rely on equivalence decisions. Neither is a like for like replacement for the EU wide common access facilitated through passporting. Seeking permissions on a state by state basis would add complexity and hence costs for financial services firms. . Trade talks are far from over The deal is certainly ambitious. But there is also a long list of things that havenapost yet been resolved. Jill Rutter of the UK in a Changing Europe think tank warned: “This is not a final done deal in many respects. There are lots of details still outstanding or to be filled in.” It contains the bare bones for a forum to hold talks between the UK and EU - a Partnership Council which will supervise the operation of the Agreement at a political level”. So while Brexit might soon be over - talks between the UK and EU will not be for many years. Theyaposll just happen behind the scenes. . And customs checks will put a aposburdenapos on firms  While the deal prevents expensive tarfs on UK goods, it doesnapost stop all disruption due to Brexit. This is because weaposre leaving the EUaposs single market and customs union, so firms need to fill out a host of new declarations. Pages and pages of the Brexit deal are devoted to the minutiae of customs rules between the two territories. And while there will be measures to make things easier - like co-operation at Dover and Holyhead and the sharing of import export data - not all of these will come on January . Some will only be in pilot form. The UK government admits it will need to be reducing administrative burdens on business in the longer term - burdens that didnapost exist before Brexit. Itaposs all a far cry from Boris Johnsonaposs claim on December  that there will be no non-tarf barriers to trade. This was flagrantly untrue. . We could still end up slapping each other with tarfs The ‘level playing field’ was a big sticking point. This means a set of common rules and standards to ensure fair competition. This stops businesses in one country with one set of lawsgaining an advantage over those in other countries with other laws . Under these rules, each side will be able to take action “as sovereign equals”the other side undercuts their industry. This means the EU will be able to slap tarfs on UK exportsthe UK is seen to undercut EU rules - and vice versa. Boris Johnson insisted this would have to be “proportionate”, infrequent and “subject to arbitration”. No said any trade distortion in these cases would have to be proven to have lasted six months or more, and be considered by an independent arbitration . . The EU will work with the UK on security - but onlythe Tories behave on human rights A big issue in negotiations - and one where both the EU and UK were keen to work together - was on security, and tackling cross border organised crime and terrorism. And the deal is an ambitious one with clear rules on the sharing of fingerprints, DNA and other forensic data. The EU said the deal builds new operational capabilities, taking account of the fact that the UK, as a non-EU member outside of the Schengen area, will not have the same facilities as before. However, Brussels has set a major condition on this agreement - the Tories must observe their commitments to the European Convention on Human Rights. The Commission said: The security cooperation can be suspended in case of violations by the UK of its commitment for continued adherence to the European Convention of Human Rights and its domestic enforcement. It comes after the Conservatives confirmed that they were launching a review of the Human Rights Act which gives the ECHR force in UK law. . There’s a special clause to avoid wine price rises  It is fair to say there are things the continent does better than the UK. And while weaposre willing to bet weaposd win a chip butty contest with anyone, only the best of Englandaposs wine can hope to hold its own against European rivals. Many goods could end up more expensive despite the trade deal, because they’ll need new declarations or checks to enter or leave the EU’s single market and customs union. But fear not, hearty quaffers - because a special provision in the deal has been written to protect the flow of vino on to our shores. It means Spanish or French wine exporters need only simplied certication, documentation, labelling and packaging requirements in order to be imported into the UK. This basically just means the price of wine might not rise as much as some other European luxury goods. . The European Parliament won’t get a vote before the deal starts  The deal has to be ratied by  EU leaders and the UK and European Parliaments. But it’s come so late, the European Parliament won’t get a vote before it takes force. Instead it will enter force as a “matter of special urgency”, provisionally until  February , to avoid EU rules ending abruptly at pm on New Year’s Eve. . And finally… it’s still not as smooth as being in the EU Asto make all that UK citizens are losing painfully clear, the EU has released a brutal graphic showing the impact Brexit will have on people in the UK. It points out we will need a visa for visits of more than  days, and will no longer benefit from frictionless trade”. By comparison, a string of green ticks show the benefits of EU membership for those living in member states. So while EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen went to great pains to point out that the deal was fair, clearly the EU want it to be clear they believe the UK will be worse off after Brexit.

The sector has failed to recover with thousands of redundancies announced and ongoing travel restrictions. Official figures studied by the Prospect union show the value of “air transport services” – flights – to the British economy dropped by % in the  months from October .  Aircraft repair and maintenance – vital to firms like Rolls-Royce which has an ongoing contract to service plane engines – dipped by % Aerospace manufacture, which includes companies like Airbus – which has bases in Bristol and Broughton, North Wales – fell by %. The falls in the aviation industry far outstrip those in the economy was a whole, with an overall % drop in GDP in the year to October – meaning the sector has been disproportionately hit. Airports and airlines were forced to slash jobs as coronavirus tightened its grip on the globe and planes ground to a halt. British Airways is in the process of cutting , posts, Virgin Atlantic has announced , job cuts and EasyJet is shedding up to , roles. Prospect general secretary Mike Clancy said: “For months trade unions, including Prospect, have been calling for a specic support package for the aviation sector, but despite warm words the Government has failed to deliver.  “Winter is traditionally the most dficult time for the aviation industry, with demand at its lowest in the early part of the year. “The Government must act now to support the whole sector – airports, air traffic control and the supply chain, as well as airlines. “If they don’t, services could be at risk, and in the longer term so many people will have left the industry it will hinder any recovery. “There will not be a wide economic recovery and no levelling up without a recovery for our aviation sector.” Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade said: “Winter is traditionally a tough period for airlines at the best of times, and we know demand is going to be well down this year what with travel bans in place and a diminishing number of air corridors open.

Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said ministers “should be moving heaven and earth” to ensure it goes to plan. Millions a week could get the jab starting next week as it is easier to distribute than the existing one. Do you think it is achievable to reopen in February  Have your say in the comments below AstraZeneca, which hopes for approval within days, said: “We think we’ve figured out the winning formula.” Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “With the virus spreading with greater speed thanks to the new iant, it’s now fiercely urgent vaccination is rolled out as quickly as possible. “This is a race against time and ministers should be moving heaven and earth to get people the jabs needed to stay safe.” AstraZeneca, the firm behind it, suggested it could be approved within days. – with the first injections as soon as next week. Boss Pascal Soriot said: “We think we have figured out the winning formula and how to get efficacy that, after two doses, is up there with everybody .” Between  and  million iniduals most at risk from Covid- have reportedly been identied by the Government. Some officials suggest this group could all be vaccinated by the end of February. Once this has happened the NHS would be less at risk of being overwhelmed by cases, and it is hoped this could lead to a relaxation of restrictions within months. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: “The early roll-out of vaccines – and the incredible work of our scientists and NHS – means we can now see light at the end of the tunnel with this pandemic.”It came as , new coronavirus cases were reported in England and Wales yesterday, and  deaths. Scotland and Northern Ireland have paused their reporting of figures over Christmas. Once the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine gets the nod it will be rolled out to millions a week because it is easier to distribute than the existing Pfizer one, which must be stored at -C.  By Christmas Eve over , doses had been administered since the first Pfizer jab was given two weeks earlier. The Oxford vaccine can be safely stored in a refrigerator, and is signicantly cheaper – at just £ a dose, compared with £ for the Pfizer. There are no signs of any concern about its safety from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.  The MHRA said: “Any vaccine must undergo robust clinical trials in line with international standards, and no vaccine would be authorised for supply in the UK unless the expected standards of safety, quality and efficacy are met.” A Government spokesman said: “The medicines regulator is reviewing the final data from the University of Oxford AstraZeneca phase three clinical trials.” The Oxford jab can be quickly manufactured and distributed at vast scale, with AstraZeneca able to produce three billion doses next year.  Trials showed an efficacy rate of  per cent when patients were given half a dose, followed by a full dose at least a month later. When two full doses were given, the rate was lower, just  per cent – meaning the overall efficacy was  per cent.

Pupils in primary school, Years  and , and vulnerable or key workers’ kids are meant tonext week - followed by other secondary pupils from January . Each pupil would get two rapid Covid tests, three days apart, with any positive results then confirmed by a lab.But thanks to a new faster-spreading iant of coronavirus, some experts have warned even this “staggered” plan won’t be enough to contain the spread.Now, according to Politico, the governmentaposs official advisors SAGE have warned secondary schools would have to shut like in the March lockdownministers hope to keep the R number below . SAGE member Sir Jeremy Farrar warned there is going to be a trade-off, you cannot have everything and that will lead to very tough choices about whether schools shut. Labour demanded a statement today from Boris Johnson, saying: It is time for the Prime Minister to get a grip on the situation and show some leadership. SAGE reportedly told Boris Johnson R would go above  eventhere is a November-style lockdown, when non-essential shops were shut and people ordered to stay at home - but schools were kept open. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is thought to be having a crunch meeting today as an ally said he would “battle” to keep classrooms open. Ministers told the Times they were sticking to plans for a staggered reopening next week. But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove today refused to rule out a change to school opening plans.He only said that “at the moment” the plan is for primary, Year , Year , and key worker or vulnerable children to go back in the first week. He told Times Radio: “We do keep things under review. “And weaposll be talking to head teachers and teachers in the next  and  hours, just to make sure that our plans, which of course, are accompanied by community testing, are right and robust.” How do you feel about schools going back  Have your say in the comments.  However, askedGCSE and A-level exams would go ahead as planned in the summer, Mr Gove told Sky News: “Oh yes, absolutely”. Speaking to the BBC he added: As a country we have decided - and I think this is the right thing to do - that we prioritise children ing to school. But we have a new strain and it is also the case that we have also had, albeit in a very limited way, Christmas mixing, so we do have to remain vigilant. We are confident that we will be able to get schools back in good order. Our plan and our timetable is there, and we are working with teachers to deliver it. Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the National Education Union, called for a two-week delay to schools being reopened. She also called for teachers and other adults in schools to be vaccinated - as healthy teachers under  are not in the first wave of the jab. Around million people in England are already living under a Tier  local lockdown - where rules are essentially the same as the November national lockdown. Millions more people in England could join Tier  this Wednesday as ministers hold the latest review of tiers. But even during the November lockdown, cases continued to rise in Kent where the new iant of coronavirus was first identied. Number  would not rule out keeping classrooms shut into the new year. A Government spokesperson said today: “We want all pupils toin January as school is the best place for their development and mental health, but as the Prime Minister has said, it is right that we follow the path of the pandemic and keep our approach under constant review. “Our huge expansion of rapid testing will support secondary schools and colleges to stay open to all pupils and reduce the risk of transmission within local communities.” Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the Governmentaposs Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies, said: I think the next few weeks going into January are going to be extremely dficult across the whole country. Certainly my own view is that schools opening is an absolute priority. But society - and eventually this is a political decision - will have to balance keeping schools open,that is possible, with therefore closing down other parts of society. It is going to be a trade-off between one or other.You cannot have everything. You cannot have the whole of society opening, and schools opening and further education and universities, and keep R below  with this iant. I think there are some very, very tough choices. We are going to see these continued pressures at least over the next two or three months.” "},{"url":null,"title":"adults uk determined top finances","story":"NewsAdults in the UK are determined to get on top of their finances in A study of adults discovered many will do things dferently in months ahead, including opting to ditch cash altogether in favour of doing everything via technologymirrorShareCommentsByLucy BrimbleLorraine King:,  DEC NewsAdults are determined to get on top of their finances\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The study of , adults found many will do things dferently in months ahead, including opting to ditch cash altogether in favour of doing everything via technology. Just under half of those polled no longer like the idea of touching physical money, and are avoiding it as much as possible. A further  per cent have got so used to conducting their financial business online, they can’t even remember the last time they visited the bank to get cash out. While almost eight in  adults prefer the convenience of doing everything digitally. A third of those polled, by Samsung Pay Card, simply prefer to make purchases using their phone rather than getting out their purse or wallet, as they feel it is a safer and more secure way of making a transaction. Teg Dosanjh, director of Connected Services and Technology at Samsung Electronics UK  Ireland, said: “The UK population has had to change its entire approach to spending and money management over the last year, particularly during periods of lockdown. “While many have gotten used to these new habits, we understand it can be overwhelming to try new things – particularly when it comes to finance management. That being said, it’s great to see people using technology to create a greater level of flexibility and control of their finances.” The study also found  per cent of adults wish they had more control over their finances, but currently  per cent feel overwhelmed and  per cent feel scared when thinking about money. But three in  have never sought advice from anyone about their money situation, while  per cent have only spoken to family or friends, rather than a professional.  Psychologist and self-care expert, Kimberley Wilson, said: “Money and mental health are intimately linked, and the relationship is bidirectional: concerns about money can contribute to stress, eroding mental health and conversely, being emotionally unwell may limit the ability to work, manage money, or make you more prone to risky spending. While it’s not always easy, taking the step to gain control of your spending can signicantly ease psychological stress. “Digital tools can make financial management accessible to everyone it’s like having a financial advisor in your pocket. Apps allow you to see all your spending in a glance: where you spend, how much you could save and where you could cut back. By reflecting on your spending, you can help to prevent the denial that we can all stumble into when dealing with the tricky subject of money. “Awareness is the first step to change, so taking a deep breath and looking at the truth of your relationship with money is the only way to make it better.”  It also emerged that  per cent of adults don’t know or understand all the dferent banking options out there now. Eight in  adults said being able to bank online offers more flexibility, something they have used more in  than ever before. But many also enjoy the ious rewards given to them by their banking provider, although more than half don’t feel they’ve made the most of any potential reward schemes, and don’t knowthey could have claimed any rewards or cashback. Seven in  hope  will be the year they get more benefits from using certain bank cards. Money expert, Emelie Bellet, said: “As we head into , Iaposd like to offer that we focus on the prospects of the post-pandemic world. “Sure,  threw everyone quite the curveball - but it also offered ample opportunity to reflect and learn.”  TOP TIPS ON HOW TO MANAGE MONEY EFFECTIVELY IN  BY EMILIE BELLETTake ownership of your finances and get your head out of the sand by completing practical tasks such as a money check-up to know where you stand in terms of outgoings, savings etc. A little planning goes a long way, so having a solid plan is useful for everything in le, and finances are certainly no exception. Get to grips with your spending patterns and take a non-judgmental look at your past transactions in order to move forward. Allow yourself a limit for conscious spending and always ask yourself questions before committing to a decision to check what rewards you’re entitled to.

Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Prof Semple said: Obviously there is an urgency about this and we know that it is dficult to vaccinate lots of people at the same time - weaposve got a population of just under  million people and weaposre going to move through them in an orderly fashion vaccinating people most at risk. He added: The people that have been vaccinated will be protected within a matter of weeks and thataposs very important. On an inidual basis these vaccines are so good that they will protect iniduals, so we donapost have to wait for this nonsense about herd immunity developing through natural infection, we can start to protect the iniduals. To get the wider community herd immunity from vaccination rather than through natural infection will take probably % to % of the population to be vaccinated, and that, Iaposm afraid, is going to take us right into the summer I expect. Prof Semple was speaking ahead of an expected approval of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine which could see millions getting the jab within weeks. It could lead to an end to lockdown by February as  million people who are most at risk of dying or getting seriously ill with  coronavirus  have reportedly been identied for urgent inoculation. The new jab is easier to distribute than the existing Pfizer one and could reach millions a week once approved. Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said ministers “should be moving heaven and earth” to ensure it goes to plan. Millions a week could get the jab starting next week as it is easier to distribute than the existing one.  AstraZeneca, which hopes for approval within days, said: “We think we’ve figured out the winning formula.” In terms of vaccine uptake, practice GP Dr Fari Ahmad has said that so far there has been little sign of vaccine hesitancy among the first groups to receive the Pfizer jab. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she said: Whataposs really interesting is a lot of the over-s are very happy to have the vaccine. I think they do understand how much of a dference it will make to them inidually and theyaposre probably the ones that have been shielding, and itaposs had a massive impact on them.

In the photograph, Sharon Anne Daly-OaposDwyer can be seen holding a Christmas present from her daughter with a big smile on her face. The tragic image was captured less than an hour before the -year-old barmaid, from Shepherdaposs Bush, west London, died. She fell off the balcony of her fourth floor apartment on Christmas morning after telling her children she was going outside for a smoke. In her final picture, she can be seen holding a designer bag given to her by her -year-old daughter Taylor Daly. Another photograph - the last one taken of the family together - shows Sharon sat in her living room beaming with happiness, alongside her son Drew and Taylor. She is posing alongside her grandson Harley, who was her aposbest friendapos, in other heartbreaking images from Christmas Day. Shortly after the pictures were taken, the children heard a loud bang outside the flat and found their mum on the ground below. Sharonaposs daughter Taylor rushed downstairs in her pyjamas and stayed by her motheraposs side all day until her body was taken away. Taylor told The Mirror: I ran down to try and help her but it was pretty obvious she had died, she wasnapost breathing and her eyes were open.  I held her hand when they stopped the CPR and closed her eyes when they said they couldnapost do anymore. I gave her a kiss and said I love you. After the paramedics stopped their efforts to resuscitate her the undertakers took Sharonaposs body away. Taylor, who described Sharon as aposthe best mumapos, has no idea how the fall happened and said the family was having a normal Christmas morning beforehand. The single mum added: She was really happy with her presents.  She said she was going to go back to bed before making dinner but would just have a cigarette. We were inside for two minutes when we heard a bang. Taylor initially thought her mum had fallen down the stairs when she heard the noise, however she was not on the stairs when she checked. My brother looked over the sideand said apossheaposs down thereapos, Taylor told The Mirror. We were just screaming.  Drew Daly, , who received a scholarship to study psychology at Loughborough University, ran straight back inside the flat after seeing the horric scene. He hugged his one-year-old nephew Harley while Taylor rushed downstairs to her mumaposs side. Tayloraposs best friend Georgie Dileo, , who described Sharon as her apossecond mumapos, received a call from Taylor about the fall and arrived before paramedics, finding her friend sat near her motheraposs body. “Taylor didnapost move from her side until the end of the day when the undertakers came,” Georgie told The Mirror. She added that Sharon had been aposspoilt with presentsapos on Christmas morning. Georgie, who was due to visit the family in the afternoon, said the tragedy is being treated as an accident. Sharon was aposthe le and soul of pubsapos in Shepherdaposs Bush and was hardest worker Georgie said she had ever met. However, she lost her job as a result of the pandemic in March and had been struggling to find work ever since.

While her words were as perfectly planned and moving as normal, she scrapped her display of family photos  in favour of a lone photo of Prince Phillip - who she spent lockdown with. But she still paid tribute to her loved ones, shining light on their hard work during the Covid- pandemic through video clips and photos shown throughout her annual broadcast.Photos and clips from Prince Charles, Camilla, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs engagements were included, as well as pictures from Kateaposs Hold Still project.But there was another, lesser known member of the family who featured this year.Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, has become more prominent throughout the coronavirus crisis - and the Queen reflected this in her Christmas message.Married to the Queenaposs youngest son Prince Edward, Sophie appeared at joint video call engagements with the Queen and Kate during the summer.  Royal sources insist the “dedicated and hard working” royal is “always busy” but has largely operated behind the scenes. Insiders dubbed her “the royal family’s secret weapon” during the coronavirus crisis, quietly steadying the ship after a tumultuous period for The Firm.She also stepped up when the family were short of senior members following Prince Harry and Meghan Markleaposs departure and Prince Andrew stepping back due to his connection to Jeffrey Epstein. Sophie was forced to self-isolate in October after coming into contact with someone who later tested positive for Covid.Going forward, Sophie and Edward, who have two children, feature in the Queenaposs new version of aposThe Firmapos - who were pictured together for the first time earlier this month.They join the Monarch, Prince Charles and Camilla, the Cambridges and Princess Ann in the new line up.  The collective will work together and help highlight each other’s causes as they aim to get back to full duties “as soon as possible”. The arrangement fits with Prince Charles’s long term vision of a slimmed down monarchy as well as the Queen’s mantra of “one must be seen to be believed”.The Queenaposs Speech was the most watched television programme broadcast on Christmas Day - beating the Strictly Come Dancing special and the nationaposs best-loved soaps.It has been revealed that . million people tuned in to watch the Queen address the nation at pm on BBC One and ITV. In the moving speech, the Queen expressed her pride and delight at the reaction many have shown during the pandemic. She said: Remarkably, a year that has necessarily kept people apart has, in many ways, brought us closer. Across the Commonwealth, my family and I have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities, helping those in need. In the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnicently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit.

The poor dog must have been absolutely terried. “She was wearing a harness so is more than likely an owned dog who ran off while on a walk and we would love to reunite her with her family who could be desperately searching for her. We scanned her for a microchip but couldn’t find one - it’s possible that the electrocution stopped it from working.  “At the moment she is in our care where she is being treated for injuries to her left leg and muzzle - but she isn’t out of the woods yet as it may be that the electrocution caused neurological damage and may not be noticeable straightaway. However she is getting a lot of love and care by staff at the hospital who are keeping an eye on her.

She is now speaking out to help other parents spot the signs of meningitis after her daughter was left needing both limbs amputated in order to save her le. Sensing something wasn’t quite right, Irisa rushed Riley to hospital, where her condition became le-threatening as medics diagnosed her with meningitis. The condition had cut off circulation in little Riley’s legs so that they turned black - and just two weeks later doctors carried out the nightmare operation. But against all odds Riley, now three, survived the ordeal and has started nursery after getting her first pair of prosthetic legs in May. First-time mother Irisa, a restaurant manager from Syracuse, New York, said: “The whole situation was really weird and I never would have guessed it was meningitis. “But I knew that there was something not right with her and I did second guess myself at first but it turned out my instincts were correct. “We were really scared because the day before this all happened, she was absolutely normal and the next day she was in a critical condition. “The doctors didn’t sugarcoat anything and didn’t knowshe was going to make it past the weekend - it was all touch and go.”  At first the mum thought that Riley’s sudden deterioration could be due to a breathing condition that she overcame as baby which had previously turned her purple in hospital. The totaposs oxygen levels and heart rate were fine when Irisa tested them with a monitor, but she decided to take her to hospital just in case. Then in December , Riley was diagnosed with streptococcal meningitis, caused by a rare ear abnormality that she was born with. Irisa said: “The meningitis was messing with Riley’s blood, which wasn’t clotting properly so she had blood transfusions to up her platelet counts.  “It started with her toes going black and wrinkly, like raisins, and throughout the next few weeks they got progressively worse and her whole legs turned black. “There weren’t a lot of options to salvage her legs and they were getting so bad that she had to be put on a burns ward. “There, we were told her muscles, tissues and everything  in her legs was dead. It was devastating.” As the weeks went by, medics told Irisa and her fiance James, , that the meningitis bacteria was starting to die and Riley was on the long road to recovery. But the deadly infection was still present in her legs, so they made the decision to amputate in a gruelling five-hour procedure. Irisa said: “We knew it was the best thing to have her legs amputated and we’d rather have her here than not at all. “She’s a very bright child so when the doctors tried to cover her stumps and slowly introduce the idea, she would take the blankets off. She was really angry and confused.  “But inside, I was certain that she would walk again someday because there’s lots of opportunities for people with limb loss. Riley began rehabilitation towards the end of her stay in hospital, before being sent home to start getting used to her new way of le. Irisa said: “It took her until the end of the summer to accept the fact she doesn’t have legs anymore and she was so stubborn about the prosthetics at first. “As a mum, it was so nice to see her back on her feet again after all that she had been through and it was like it had never happened.”  Little Riley reached her first milestone when she began nursery last month. Irisa added: “Socially, she was very lonely when she lost her legs and, due to her breathing issues as a baby, she had missed out on making friends earlier on in le. “But preschool has given her a new lease of le because she’s managed to make lots of friends and she absolutely loves it.

The student said they assumed the vast majority were looking up answers on their phone, which aposirritated meapos but they stayed focused and made their way through the paper. After leaving the exam hall, the pupil remembered there was one particular question that wasnapost related to what they had all been taught in class, which had two parts. Part A was aposfairly easyapos but they had no idea how to do part B, so they simply left it blank as it only accounted for  marks out of . When all the exams had been marked, their teacher sent all the university students an email to explain his diabolical plan to catch out those who had given themselves some outside help. Many of the pupils used the internet to find answers to exam and homework questions. Their teacher decided to use it against them after becoming fed up with students using the bathroom as an excuse to look up answers on their phones. The student wrote on Reddit: He purposely made part B impossible to solve, and about a month before the final he got a teaching assistant to ask the exact question [online], which was distinctly worded to be unique.  He then created his own account and answered the question with a bulls*** solution that seems right at first glance but is actually fundamentally flawed and very unlikely that someone would make the same assumptions and mistakes independently. From the  exams handed in,  of them fell for the trick and gave the exact answer their own teacher had posted online.

Zhang is the first person known to have been tried and was among a handful of people whose firsthand accounts from crowded hospitals and empty streets painted a more dire picture of the pandemic epicentre than the official narrative. Her lawyer, Ren Quanniu, said they would be appealing the sentencing. Ms Zhang believes she is being persecuted for exercising her freedom of speech, he had said before the trial. Criticism of Chinaaposs early handling of the crisis has been censored and whistle-blowers, such as doctors, warned. State media have credited success in reining in the virus to the leadership of President Xi Jinping. The virus has spread worldwide to infect more than  million people and kill over . million, paralysing air travel as nations threw up barriers against it that have disrupted industries and livelihoods. In Shanghai, police enforced tight security outside the court where the trial opened seven months after Zhangaposs detention, although some supporters were undeterred. A man in a wheelchair, who told Reuters he came from the central province of Henan to demonstrate support for Zhang as a fellow Christian, wrote her name on a poster before police arrived to escort him away. Foreign journalists were denied entry to the court due to the epidemic, court security officials said. A former lawyer, Zhang arrived in Wuhan on February  from her home in Shanghai.  Her short video clips uploaded to YouTube consist of interviews with residents, commentary and footage of a crematorium, train stations, hospitals and the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Detained in mid-May, she went on a hunger strike in late June, court documents seen by Reuters say. Her lawyers told the court that police strapped her hands and force-fed her with a tube.By December, she was suffering headaches, giddiness, stomach ache, low blood pressure and a throat infection.

Loujain al-Hathloul, , has been held since  following her arrest along with at least a dozen other activists. Today, a Saudi court sentenced her to five years and eight months in prison, her family and local media said. Hathloul was charged with seeking to change the Saudi political system and harming national security, Sabq and al-Shark al-Awsat newspapers said. The court suspended two years and  months of her sentence - most of the time already served since her arrest on May ,  - with a conditional release to follow, the newspapers and Hathloulaposs sister said. She could therefore be released around the end of February , with ato prison possibleshe commits any crime, according to the newspapers. Hathloul was also given a five-year travel ban, her sister Lina tweeted, adding that both the public prosecutor and Hathloul could appeal the judgeaposs verdict. The trial has drawn international condemnation as Riyadh faces renewed US scrutiny.The verdict poses an early challenge to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salmanaposs relationship with US President-elect Joe Biden, who has criticised Riyadhaposs human rights record.UN human rights experts have called the charges spurious and along with leading rights groups and politicians in the United States and Europe have called for the womanaposs release. Hathloul, who had championed womenaposs right to drive and for ending the kingdomaposs malesystem, was subjected to abuse, including electric shocks, waterboarding, flogging and sexual assault, rights groups and her family say. Saudi authorities have denied the charges. The criminal court last week cleared the prosecution of torturing Hathloul in detention, saying there was no evidence to support the allegations. Hathloulaposs sentencing came nearly three weeks after a Riyadh court jailed US-Saudi physician Walid al-Fitaihi for six years, despite US pressure to release him, in a case rights groups have called politically motivated. Foreign diplomats said the two trials aimed to send a message at home and abroad that Saudi Arabia would not yield to pressure on human rights issues. Riyadh could also use the sentences as leverage in future negotiations with the Biden administration, one diplomat said.

I’ve never scored one in Scotland before.“At the end of the day, the only thing that matters is points. We did our job on Saturday and now we start preparing for Alloa.“We know this win means nothingwe don’t go and perform on Tuesday against Alloa.”Week by week Sow has shown improvements as he regains match fitness following recovery from a ruptured Achilles tendon at the start of the year while at Dundee United.In the last two weeks he’s begun adding goals and looking more like the frontman who made his name at Tynecastle.A simple header broke the deadlock at Palmerston as he held off Willie Gibson to nod into the top corner from Charlie Adam’s corner delivery.From there, the Dark Blues rarely looked in trouble despite deteriorating weather conditions.Sow almost added a second minutes afterwards as he got on the end of some sharp forward play from Danny Mullen but saw his finish kept out by Queens goalie Rohan Ferguson.On  minutes he got that second thanks to some slack defending by the home side.A fluffed clearance saw Mullen scamper through on goal only to be stopped by the onrushing Ferguson outside the area.However, the ball fell to Sow  yards out who found the net at the second attempt after Ayo Obileye stopped his first effort.Dundee were looking dangerous with every attack at this point but had to be alert in their own area with Liam Fontaine and Lee Ashcroft required on a number of occasions to defend their box.Heading into the second half, the wind and rain intensied and chances became more dficult for the visitors playing into the wind.They did, though, seal the points through Sow once more. Fontaine’s long throw was eventually touched on by Mullen to find Sow at the far post for a tap-in.Dominating the contest at - up, it was inevitable thoughts would turn to what happened in a similar situation against Dunfermline the week previously.However, Dee goalkeeper Jack Hamilton was on hand to make a big save from Queens midfielder Dan Pybus with  minutes to go, turning the low finish wide of the post.The keeper, though, was beaten on  minutes with a big assist from the wind sending Connor Shields’ cross into the far corner.There was to be no repeat of the Pars collapse this time as Dundee earned their first away win of the Championship campaign.And Sow hopes the Dark Blues can follow the victory up with another at home to Alloa on Tuesday night.“Hopefully, we can go on a run now but one game at a time,” he added.“We are now four games unbeaten with a couple of draws – now we need to win the next game. Hopefully, we can start a run.“Alloa is a huge game for us.“It’s the biggest game of the season for us because it’s now all we focus on. We’ll be doing everything we can to win.”Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\": today for unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Martin Bonar replaced Scott Johnston for Saints while Chris Hart made way for Innes Meikle for the hosts.The deadlock was broken in the th minute from a quickly-taken free kick by Cammy Hill after Martin Bonar had been brought down in the centre circle by James McGuiness.Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space on the right and sent him scurrying forward. McKay cut into the box and picked out the run of Craig MacEwan who was foiled from six yards by Ally Lewis.The young keeper#s good work was undone when he couldn#t hold MacEwan#s shot allowing the ball to spin away from him.Ben Forbes was on hand with a sliding challenge to knock the loose ball away from MacEwan but only as far as Gavin Forgrieve, who gleefully tapped home from four yards.Lewis saved again from MacEwan three minutes later this time managing to hold onto the ball at the second attempt before a neat Matty Kelly turn on the corner of the Star -yard box wrong footed Ben Forbes creating the space for Kelly to curl a ball to the far post a matter of inches in front of the outstretched boot of Scott Maitland.Maitland got forward again in the st minute finding Gavin Forgrieve in front of goal.

The current bus stop and car park at the head of Glen Croe would also be bypassed. This is an important public transport link for local residents.The consultation launched by the Scottish Government’s Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson is a muddled exercise. It confuses the urgent need to decide on an alternative route for a new road through Glen Croe with the much longer-term strategic transport options for improving connectivity between Argyll and west-central Scotland.Most of the strategic options involve a number of new civil engineering challenges including the construction of bridges over Loch Long and Loch Fyne and extensive road building, both new and upgraded. For reasons of cost and complexity, none of these options are likely to be implemented within this decade.Whatever long-term strategy options may be investigated for their feasibility, there remains the urgent need to build a new road in Glen Croe. It will always be necessary to link the communities of Arrochar Tarbetwith Loch Goil, Cairndow, north Loch Fyne, Inveraray and beyond with the A.I note that both my local community council in Loch Goil and Argyll and Bute Council support the route that follows the existing forest track on the opposite side of the glen from the Rest and Be Thankful without a similar risk of landslides. Compared with the strategic options, this is a modestof road to construct.The sooner that steps are taken to realise this solution the better it will be for all who currently suffer the increasingly frequent road closures due to climate change and the unstable hill.Alastair R Moodie, LochgoilheadSir,Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling session with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC ScotlandSir,Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Why  Because this modication very effectively protects moths from becoming bat-fodder.Butterflies are active during the day but moths are mostly nocturnal. And under the night sky moths make a tasty meal for insectivorous bats. These tiny mammals detect their prey by echo-location, a method of hunting that involves emitting repeated ultrasonic squeaks, generally with a dominant frequency range of - kilohertz . Their prey is then located from the direction of the ing echoes.Moths have evolved ious mechanisms to evade these predators: some have developed ears that detect bat echolocation calls, allowing them to take evasive action, but others, the earless moths, have to rely on passive defences – so-called acoustic camouflage # that is, their hairy thoraces.Comparing tomographic echo images from two species of earless moths with two species of diurnal butterflies, the Bristol scientists found very little effect on the ultrasound echoes from the thin layer of thoracic scales of butterflies. In contrast, the hair-like scales covering moth thoraces absorbed around  per cent of the ultrasonic sound energy in the broadband - kHz. This provides clear protection from hunting bats and consequently is a very signicant survival advantage.Addressing the mechanisms behind the ultrasound reduction achieved by moth thoraces, the scientists found that the hair-like scales form a connected network of air pockets, which act as porous ultrasound absorbers. Sound waves entering the network cause air molecules in the pockets to vibrate, thereby dissipating energy and reducing echo reflection.The overall arrangement and microstructure of hair-like moth scales closely resembles man-made fibrous materials designed to absorb sound but, interestingly, the Bristol team showed that the moth scales have a considerably higher absorption capacity. So perhaps we could learn lessons from these small hairy creatures.* J. R. Soc.

There are plainly the financial resources to deal with this.It is an inexcusable dereliction of duty on their part and will not be forgiven or forgotten by people whose jobs and livelihoods are being threatened by this ongoing crisis.Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands RegionSir,I am delighted that the Scottish Government is taking forward my campaign for greater fire safety precautions in social housing.Guidance is now going out to the building industry, ahead of installing fire sprinklers in all new social housing with new regulations coming into effect next year.The sprinklers will be a requirement in new flats, maisonettes and larger multi-occupancy dwellings, including where care is provided.Fire sprinklers have  proved time and time again to be effective in the fight against fire and I know that this move will save lives.There has always been strong backing for these plans from the public, the industry and other MSPs, especially in the light of the Grenfell Tower disaster.I would still like retro-fitting sprinklers in older properties to be considered and, although that is my longer term hope, I understand the problems this would pose.I am delighted this is coming in before I retire as an MSP at next year#s election – what better than a le-saving #present# at Christmas David Stewart MSP, Highlands and Islands RegionSir,Can I please, through the columns of the Argyllshire Advertiser, say a very big thank you to all the wonderful staff and their manager Nan Anderson at the council#s Ardfenaig care home in Ardrishaig.These people have, since the lockdown and well before that, given those in their care love and affection that is second to none.On a daily basis they put themselves in harm#s way, to the benefit of not only the residents but also the relatives of the residents, and may I personally say they do it in a professional and loving way.On behalf of those in your care, especially those who cannot say it for themselves, #Thank you and a very merry Christmas to you all#.Leonard McNeill, MinardSir,I congratulate the Scottish Government on its recent commitment to a bill that will give the role of local government legal status in Scotland.The European Charter of Local Self-Government Bill has been proposed and fought for by Andy Wightman of the Green Party. It aims to incorporate the European Charter of Local Self-Government into Scots law, setting out certain rights for councils and protecting them from centralisation.It’s been strongly supported by local government body COSLA, whose president, Councillor Alison Evison said: #This is a good day for democracy in Scotland. It is a good day for our communities.# It’s also a good day for our hard-pressed local government.Here in Argyll and Bute, I think we recognise the absolute necessity of so many of the services provided by local government for our day-to-day wellbeing.We also recognise the increasingly challenging responsibility involved in the delivery of those services, not least in the face of Covid- and the climate emergency, which both have tested us all this year.Our comings and goings have been adversely affected by both these #events#, as our social relations are constrained by the first, and our movements, our access and connectivity by the unprecedented scale of the A Rest and be Thankful landslides.Andy Wightman’s Bill,enacted, will give people a stronger voice in the conduct of their  affairs, and we will increasingly need that stronger voice to advocate for our present and our future in Argyll and Bute.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,The much-loved Erskine Tree of Honour was dedicated and lit in fine style last week.Every year the Tree of Honour dedications lead us into the festive season.This year, in spite of the pandemic, we embrace the opportunity to remember those who will be missing from our lives this Christmas.

The rules and regulations put in place to control coronavirus have put paid to that tradition for this year.#But that does not mean that communities cannot sing Christmas carols, even while everyone keeps their distance.#A creative way around this has been the suggestion that on Sunday December  at pm, people should gather on their doorsteps, or by a window, and sing out together. Just as communities rallied to thank NHS and other key-workers by standing in their doorways to make a joyful noise on Thursday evenings, the idea is that we can all join together to sing in Christmas – to be heralds,not angels!#Five carols are going to be sung nationwide that night: O Come all ye Faithful, Still the Night, Once in Royal David’s City, Away in a Manger and Hark the Herald Angels Sing – and the Ardrishaig community is being encouraged to join in.#Carol sheets have been made available at the church, in Peter Law  Sons, Morna#s Flower Shop and McColl#s.#It has also been suggested thatpeople wanted they could leave a donation for Ardrishaig Social Club’s Pensioners# Christmas Dinner .#Typically  or so folk gather for their Christmas dinner and some light entertainment on the Friday before Christmas but, of course, that isn’t possible this year.

Give until January  and public donations will be doubled by the UK Government, up to £ million – meaning we can reach even more hungry children in Liberia with le-changing school meals.Please visit marysmeals.org.uk Christmas to set your place.Wishing you a peaceful and happy Christmas.Daniel Adams , executive director, Mary’s Meals UKSir,What happened to Lochgilphead postmaster Findlay Campbell was tragic.But we need to get the post office service back.I realise that a Post Office van comes up from Tarbert three days a week at the moment, but with a queue of  people having to stand in the cold and damp # as there was on a Wednesday recently # this is hardly conducive to the customers# health, let alone convenience.I trust something is being done tothis much-needed service to the town of Lochgilphead.Celia MacFarlane, LochgilpheadSir,During questions to Transport Secretary Michael Matheson on Thursday December , I told the minister that people were exasperated with the condition of both the A and A after years of promises of investment in them.Mr Matheson’s response, which mainly referenced plans to upgrade the A and the A, will be of little comfort to residents and businesses in the West Highlands who are utterly dependent on the A and A.We have had more than enough woolly pledges over the years, usually made in the run-up to an election, which are then quietly forgotten afterwards, and I’m afraid that Michael Matheson’s response indicates that it will be business as usual as far as his government is concerned.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,I found your article on #Tougher health cuts worry# in the December  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser very dficult to read.I was concerned about the statement attributed to Councillor Mulvaney saying: #It is the same things that are there # learning disability, older people and physical disability # all chunky sums of money at circa £k to ££k#.Yes, they are chunky sums of money and have been on the agenda for some time.  However, we are talking about people human beings who have ious disabilities, learning, physical, and people who are older, something that will eventually happen to us all. People are not just a category for cost cutting, particularly those most vulnerable.This statement could be interpreted in many ways. For me it reads that people with such disabilities and getting older are a drain on our resources, and we need to cut out the services we provide for them. It all sounds like they are a burden on the finances, and that has got to stop. All because the budget must be balanced#at any cost it seems.My question to Councillor Mulvaney is quite simple # What you would do to address these particular costs  Decant everyone into another council area, or simply just hope thatservices are cut so they cannot live in their own homes, or indeed anywhere within Argyll and Bute, they leave Perhaps CouncillorMulvaney has never experienced anyone with disabilities. I have, and unless one has that experience then putting a price on providing a quality service is impossible. Vulnerable people need support which gives them, as much as possible, some sort of a meaningful le. Maybe that is why costs cannot actually be cut, and there needs to be a complete re-think. People are not just a statistic, nor should they be apparently dismissed as a commodity that is costing too much.If the HSCP does not have enough funding to deliver the services stated in the strategic plan, and to the standards it states, it needs to fight to get the correct level of funding from the Scottish Government, or perhaps look at itself and cut down on what I see are excessive layers of management, to make savings in order to deliver to the right level of all services within Argyll and Bute.Heather A Grier, CowalSir,A tunnel in the Faroe Islands is almost complete.

These species grow in the arid conditions of the Middle East and the Horn of Africa, where they have been tapped for their precious sap for millennia.Mentioned in ancient Hebrew texts, frankincense and myrrh were prized for the sweet aromatic fumes they produce when burned, and were used to freshen the airduring embalming of the dead and offering sacrices to the gods. Frankincense and myrrh are components of incense, and as such were carried along ancient trade routes.Incense reached Western Europe with crusaders ing from the Eastern Roman Empire where it was wafted in churches, a use that continues today.Also, frankincense and myrrh are used in traditional Chinese medicines # recommended for conditions as erse as inflammation, pain, fever, indigestion and ulcers. They are also components of mosquito deterrents, deodorants and toothpaste. All fairly obscure you may think, but sales of frankincense have recently rocketed it is now an important part of the international, multi-million pound essential oil industry. Great for the trade, but the booming market is putting severe strain on the supply chain*.Back in the Horn of Africa the trees are suffering. Powerful middle men are encouraging local owners to over-tap their trees for this desirable commodity, resulting in stressed trees, less seed production and virtually no young trees growing up to maintain the plantations.Yet, there is hope, but speed is of the essence. Tappers are being encouraged to form co-operatives, and are getting expert help with tree management. Nevertheless, spare a thought for the growers and the trees as you enjoy your frankincense-scented bath over the Christmas break.* New Scientist   December "},{"url":null,"title":"three ps and posters at tarbert sewer project","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Everyone can play their part in helping to protect the environment by only flushing the three Ps.#The project involves increasing the size of almost  metres of sewer pipe, with large diameter sewers being installed along Barmore Road, Harbour Street, and on a short section of School Road.Work goes on in a challenging environment, with continued wet weather and tidal events which flood excavations and restrict access to the working areas but, despite this, the team had laid  metres of new pipework along Harbour Street and installed two new manholes by the end of last week .To minimise disruption the improvement work is being carried out in phases and a road closure, originally planned for Barmore Road in January , has now been avoided.The next phase of the project is due to start on Barmore Roadon January .Temporary traffic lights will operate on Barmore Road for approximately three months to allow for a water main ersion and the installation of a new sewer pipe.Parking restrictions will also be in place on Barmore Road during this time.

The HSCP has also provided a webcam, headset and hands-free audio unit for remote consultations.Among a number of private donations was money to provide frames for WWII remembrance boards researched by the late Bob Adams. Sadly, Bob was unable to finish this work, which was then completed by Here We Are. The boards now have pride of place in the Coorie Inn.Sharon Hepburn, acting chairwoman of Cairndow HRC, said: #We are grateful to all our donors. The HRC also wants to acknowledge the value of the donation of time.#The hall is entirely dependent on volunteers. Without residents giving their time the hall would not work.#Over recent months the HRC has been overwhelmed by the generous donation of people#s time to improve and develop the facility.#A huge thank you to you all.#"},{"url":null,"title":"news from the districts december 25 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All of our young people are our future andthey require a little help to get there, then so be it.I have heard that Councillor Mulvaney says he has an accounting background, but he seems to lack compassion. Is this a trait of accountants He is depute leader of the council and policy lead for financial services and major projects. To my mind he is not showing a particularly good example to his fellow councillors by making statements that are ill-informed and condemn the vulnerable to miserable lives.Argyll and Bute Council led the way with #care in the community# when this was brought in by the Scottish Government now it seems it doesn’t give a damn for care in the community.Do his fellow councillors want to be tarred with the same brush Is everyone in Councillor Mulvaney#s Helensburgh Central ward hale and hearty with no disabilities  I do not think so.Maybe now is the time that Councillor Mulvaney looks at his current positions before Argyll and Bute Council gains a reputation it does not deserve.An incredibly angry resident of Argyll and Bute, name and address suppliedSir,End of le charity Marie Curie is calling on people across Scotland to brave the chill and do a festive dip to show support for those impacted by death, dying and bereavement.This year has been challenging for many and the charity sector has taken a huge hit, with fundraising events cancelled since Covid- hit in the spring. Marie Curie nurses have been working on the frontline throughout the pandemic caring for people at end of le at the Glasgow and Edinburgh hospices and in people’s homes across Scotland.Marie Curie needs to raise £, every month to provide care and services in Scotland.During the festive season, I hope our supporters will back the new Christmas campaign # running from December  to January  # encouraging people and their four-legged friends to get outdoors and do a festive dip either bare footed or in wellies, in the sea, a puddle or a bucket of ice.We are asking people to take a photo of themselves taking the dip, post it on their social media channels, tag seven friends and donate £ to Marie Curie.We know there has been much sadness this year and we want people to smile throughout the festive season.Living in Scotland we are never short of a puddle or two, and are lucky to be surrounded by coastlines, so there’s always going to be the perfect opportunity for the whole family to get outdoors and unleash their inner child.To donate visit www.justgiving campaign festivedip.Debbie Mooney, head of community fundraising, Marie CurieSir,The fact that UNICEF, the UN’s child protection wing, will for the first time intervene to support those at risk of hunger in the UK, is a damning indictment on the depths to which the UK has sunk.UNICEF has put its funding behind a scheme designed to provide breakfast boxes to , families over the course of the Christmas holidays – marking the first emergency response in the UK by the organisation since it was founded in .Rising levels of food poverty in the UK are an absolute disgrace and the Tory government should be ashamed of this.We are supposedly one of the richest countries in the world.

Decoratefestive candleCandle sales have soared in the UK in the last few months, as we seek to make the dark nights spent at home feel warmer, cosier and more lsquohyggersquo.

Itrsquos best to do this all outside to minimise mess- so make sure the weather is dry while you do so. Once your frosty branches are complete you can either display them outside or in a vase indoors- they look particularly good when illuminated by a candle or the twinkle of Christmas lights.Get the tutorial here..

There are plainly the financial resources to deal with this.It is an inexcusable dereliction of duty on their part and will not be forgiven or forgotten by people whose jobs and livelihoods are being threatened by this ongoing crisis.Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands Region.I was happy to hear from my constituents when I was out and about in Bowmore again recently.Many pressing  matters were raised including the poor condition of pavements, faultily street lights at Stanalane and potholes on Shore St and Jamieson St.The recent vandalism of the hand sanitiser dispenser within the bus shelter is as worrying as it is unacceptable.All of these matters and more have been raised with the appropriate department and I will continue to lobby relentlessly for better infrastructure across the Kintyre and the Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.I see Claudia Winkleman is to be paid £ million for her #work#.While I am sure she is a capable broadcaster, and may be worth a good salary, surely £ million is extracting the liquid.I have calculated that this sum amounts to ,  free television licences for the over-s. When you then think of other celebrities earning mouth-watering sums from the BBC, this gives clear evidence that the BBC could quite easily continue with the free television licences for the over-s.My income does not qualy for pension credit by a small margin but I have now had two communications from TV Licensing reminding me to pay the fee.Each time it encloses a brochure and ious forms to complete in the hope that I feel empowered to pay the £. required to watch TV.So far, I have decided to weather the storm and not pay. My hope is that thousands of over-s do likewise and Auntie will realise that expecting us to fall into line is not as simple as it expects.Silver Voices continue to pressure the BBC to think again and reinstate free licences for the over-s.It has my full support and will continue to do so until the BBC bites the bullet and cancels its continued harassment of OAPs.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.For many of us, the festive season is a time for giving and sharing, which is why we’re inviting you to celebrate Giving Tuesday.I’d like to take a moment to share with your readers how, in choosing to give to our charity, Revitalise, you’ll be making a real dference to the lives of the disabled people and carers that we support.As a charity we know that however tricky this past year has been, le is about spending time with the people we love, and everyday le can so easily get in the way of that. Hilary has cared for her son Shaun since he had an accident on holiday in Ibiza, aged .Caring is simply something she does for the person she loves. As she explains: #For the last  years I’ve been caring for Shaun but I definitely wouldn’t call myself a carer, it’s just something I do as his mum.#I’m never, ever, going to give up on my son. Le is too short you know you need to keep fighting.#On top of the dficulties this year has presented, disabled people and the elderly have also been left with far less support than usual, as the Emergency Coronavirus Act allowed local authorities to axe their duty of care responsibilities. Feeling vulnerable and abandoned, many carers are close to breaking point.#This is why we have launched our campaign, Care For Carers and the fundraiser Raise a Million, aiming to raise £ million to support carers and their loved ones to access respite care breaks following lockdown.We have provided respite care breaks # a vital leline to so many unpaid home carers and their disabled loved ones # for over  years.So, in celebration of Giving Tuesday this month, why not pledge to give something special to our charity this festive season I am so proud to work for Revitalise as we amply the voice of carers, and will continue to do so until carers stories are heard. Please support our campaignyou can, and help us spread the word about the struggles carers are facing right now.To find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or the ways that we may be able to support guests, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Devon Prosser, Revitalise"},{"url":null,"title":"paving the way for a future in sport","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The moon lit up the landscape and the whole earth breathed peace.The only sound was the quiet lapping as the ocean rolled its waves once again to the shore. The darkness was penetrated by billions of pinpricks of light, reminding me that light has the last word.We are waiting for the lighter nights. We are waiting for the ening days. We are waiting for the light. We are waiting for the light, and for the le light.We wait quietly in a cosmic silence. Waiting can bring peace as we find God’s presence in the present. Waiting can bring hope as we know the light will come.But it’s hard to stop and wait it’s not easy to pause and ponder it’s dficult to take time at this time. We’re busy with the bargains and not so bothered about the baby.We’re busy with the tinsel but haven’t time for the truth. We’re busy with the mince pies and we will get round to the manger.We’re busy trying to fix the tree lights but have forgotten about theWe’re busy with the cards but have pushed away the crib.

And then, over the next couple of years, we slowly got them recorded.#Since forming The Strunts, the duo have performed live for a handful of gigs including the Kintyre Songwriters Festival and a couple of Homesong sets.David added: #Obviously it’s been impossible to perform recently and, as a result, we focussed on getting the album out. We#re delighted to say it is now for sale at The Kintyre Larder and The Fish Shop with donations from it going to Kintyre Food Bank and Children First.#Since the album#s release, the pair have had some great reviews in the music press, including this one from Ian D Hall in the Liverpool Sound And Vision: #Together as The Strunts, Les and David have found a common cause, one that sees the release of the album Too Much Of Everything, consistently catching the ear throughout.#The listener starts to understand that the only things you can have too much of are hate, apathy, ignorance and grief, that even in anger there must be subtle humour paving the way to the hope of healing.#A tremendous introduction to a new partnership.#Too Much of Everything is available for £ at The Kintyre Larder and at The Fish Shop, with  per cent of those sales being donated to the food bank and Children First until the end of January."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane december 18 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The landlord claimed that through inadvertent evidence upon which he proposed to rely had not been led before the court below and the appeal was allowed. Having heard the additional evidence, the higher court have now refused the appeal, and find the landlord appellant liable in expenses.In the course of a note, the court state that it was not disputed that the applicant was a yearly tenant of his house and land, and that his tenancy did not cease on his employment being brought to an end.Section  of the Crofters Act, , does not therefore apply, as these subjects were not let during the continuance of the employment, and he was not a tradesman placed in the district by the landlord for the benefit of the neighbourhood.Indeed, the respondent#s agent refused to found upon that section, and he placed his case upon the general argument that as this house was required for an estate servant, it would be a great hardship for the proprietor to be deprived of its use for that purpose, after the applicant#s intimation that he did not propose any longer to accept employment from the estate.The tenant has fulfilled all the statutory conditions and titling him to be declared a statutory small tenant, and we have no option but to grant an order to that effect. We therefore agree with the court below that this play falls to be repelled.The only other points raised by the respondent was that these subjects did not constitute a holding in respect that the ground attached to the house was of comparatively small extent. For the reasons stated by Mr Barber, we do not see that we can give effect to this plea, and as the appellants agent stated that he did not raise any question on the amount of rent fixed, we have refused the appeal.Agent for the landlord # Mr Archd.

All important, yes, but why did he fail to mention the two sectors that face the challenge to their survival caused by Brexit: farming and fishing  Both sectors face severe financial ruin.On fishing, west coast fishermen rely on rapid transit to get their catches of prawns, langoustines, crabs and lobsters to Europe within  hours of landing.These vital exports will, due to Brexit, be subject to senseless bureaucracy of red tape before they reach their destination.Warnings from the fishing businesses all along the west coast of Scotland have been ignored by the UK Government. Coupled with this delay are tarfs set as Britain will no longer be an EU member.Next, to farming. Everything points to constant financial hardship. Lamb exports, vital for every sheep farmer in Scotland, face EU levies of  per cent of the value of these animals.For example, prime lambs currently worth £ to export will near be worth £. These levels ofwill make sheep production unviable. All exports of world famous Scotch beef will be levied, as well as Scotch food and drink exports currently worth many millions to the Scottish economy.In the  EU referendum, Scotland voted  per cent to  per cent to remain in the EU. As everyone in the UK surveys the last minute shambles of #No deal or bad deal#, they must be amazed at the absolute mess we are in.Our chance of salvation or rescue comes next May when Scotland has a chance to let Mr Cameron realise the folly of his party#s ways.Robert MacIntyre, Rothesay.First our children painted rainbows, then we stood on our doorsteps applauding the NHS.Now Scotland#s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and devolved administration will grant a one-off #thank you# payment to all NHS Scotland staff. The gross sum of £ will be paid to all full-time staff, including primary care and home care staff and care home and hospice workers.This bonus sum, costing upwards of £ million, will be taxable, resulting in those NHS staff members on the lowest income likely to be hit the hardest.Part-time staff are to receive a #proportionate share# and employees in receipt of top-up benefits may experience a #knock-on# effect on entitlements.The Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, said #many care home workers are part-time, so the fear is that they will end up with a derisory payment#.Let#s also remember that in England and Wales, tax is payable at  per cent on taxable income up to £,. In Scotland, our tax is payable at  per cent on taxable income up to £,.Le Presidente Nicola and her Sepratista Nationale Politicohave put on something akin to a magic show. The question you may wish to ask yourself, is this worthy of your applause Tommy Macpherson, Saddell.I was disappointed that my amendment, brought to the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and the Islands Area Committee to retain the underspend of £, designated for Tarbert regeneration improvements, was not supported by Councillor Alastair Redman.I appreciate that the councillors who represent Lochgilphead were keen that the additional monies should top-up the costs of the project at the Front Green as that tender has come in much in excess of the original budget, but it is deplorable that a councillor elected to represent Tarbert chose to vote against the amendment that would have allowed Tarbert to benefit from the funding allocated for improvements in the village.I would assure all residents in Tarbert that I will work for the people of Tarbert, who elected me to represent them in the best way I can.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands.Being a previous resident in the Wee Toon, and now residing in Helensburgh, I totally agree that Campbeltown and all other rural places in Argyll, should have been moved to tier one a couple of weeks ago.Helensburgh has had its tier two status challenged recently by sailors from Faslane in several groups going to the boozers and buying #substantial# meals with several beers, but are classed as being from the same household due to being on the same ship.Also #Weegies# getting the short train journey from Glasgow and breaching the travel rules to infest the area unlawfully.We are the closest town to the Covid hot spots, which certainly doesn#t help matters.I hope Nicola Sturgeon sees sense and allows all rural places in Argyll to be exempt from the harsh restrictions that are unfairly spread over the whole of the region.Name and address supplied.I see Bruno Tonioli is pocketing £, a minute during his current appearances on Strictly Come Dancing which equates to a further  free TV licences for the over s.Is it any wonder the BBC has a problem with those of us refusing to pay the licence fee of £. when it can pay mouth-watering sums to endless so-called celebrities.I realise the BBC has a duty to honour contracts but perhaps honouring previous pledges to OAPs over  would be a way forward.I also see water bills are likely to increase every year for the next six years, adding an average increase in council tax bills of £ per annum.Seeing as it seems to have rained every day since October in this part of the world, I begin to wonder how water companies can equate this increase to all citizens who have no alternative other than to pay.Perhaps internal budgeting within these companies could well be a sensible solution.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.We are launching the Young People’s Board for Change, and want to recruit  members aged between  and  years, from across the country.The board members will use the  to raise awareness of what matters most to them, take action and make change happen. They will also have a big role internally advising staff and trustees.The young people will take part in new experiences and opportunities, meet other young people, as well as develop confidence and learn le-long new skills, such as campaigning and public speaking.Over a two-year period, members will take part in residentials, meetings and workshops, and campaign to share their views and opinions.We want as many young people as possible to have the chance to apply, so we are encouraging parents and carers to speak to their children about this exciting opportunity, and teachers and other professionals to share details with their students and through their networks.Find out more at nspcc.org.uk boardforchange, or for an informal chat please contact participationteam@nspcc.org.uk.The deadline for completed applications is January  and interviews will be held between January  and .Carla Malseed, local campaigns manager for NSPCC Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week december 18 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The ordinary merged with the extraordinary and hope was born.The ordinary and the extraordinary became the midwe of our faith.One explanation could be that Jupiter and Saturn were in alignment on that starry night so long ago.What do astronomers make of this idea Tim O#Brien, associate director of Jodrell Bank Observatory, suggests this would have looked striking.#It#s remarkable how much your attention is drawn when two very bright objects come together in the sky,# he explains.And once the planets lined up in their orbits, Earth would #overtake# the others, meaning that Jupiter and Saturn would appear to change direction in the night sky. A wandering star I invite you to look to the south west about an hour after sunset on the winter solstice, December .You may see something that has not happened for  years. Jupiter and Saturn will come so close together that it will look just like one giant, amazing star.Could this astronomical display of beauty have happened around the time of Jesus#s birth I believe God uses nature to speak to us, and the more time we spend learning about the wonders of nature, the closer we come to God."},{"url":null,"title":"msp presses for detail on football funding","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It can be portrayed as kitsch, comic, romantic, violent, fantastical, gritty, historic or contemporary and its characters can be ordinary, terrying or inspiring.#Scotland can be gloriously Scottish or it can be the coast of Turkey, the wilderness of Nova Scotia or even the surface of Jupiter. With such a reputation, we can be sure that film-makers will continue to come to Scotland to use our spectacular landscape in telling their stories.#The programme also tells how Gene Kelly came to Scotland to find a location for the famous musical film, Brigadoon, but it was too wet so they decided to film on a Hollywood sound stage instead.Viewers will be transported to Glenfinnan Viaduct in Inverness-shire. Made famous worldwide by the Harry Potter films, the viaduct attracts thousands of tourists.They will also learn that an archaeologist discovered a star map beneath the spectacular pinnacle of the Old Man of Storr on the Isle of Skye which starts the mission to discover the origins of humankind in Ridley Scott’s  film Prometheus.Michelle Pfefer is filmed at the Quiraing and the Fairy Pools in Skye in Stardust, Mel Gibson’s Braveheart rebellion was filmed in Glen Nevis near Fort William, and scenes in Rob Roy were filmed in Glencoe with the Three Sisters mountains often in the background.The programme also reveals Eilean Donan Castle was the headquarters of the warlike Clan MacLeod in the cult fantasy Highlander. It also featured in romantic comedy Made of Honour, while the Highland Games in that movie was filmed at Dunvegan Castle on Skye.The opening battle scene in the film Highlander was filmed at Buachaille Etive Mòr and Buachaille Etive Beag at the entrance of Glencoe, and the  film The Kidnappers, set in a Scots colony in Cape Breton, was filmed in Glen Affric.The classic Scottish comedy The Maggie introduced the Crinan Canal and Islay’s Bowmore and Port Askaig to international cinema audiences.Other film locations that feature include Mull in the  classic novel I Know Where I’m Going and When Eight Bells Toll, and Iona in art house film Iona which gave Sorcha Groundsell her first major acting role.Entrapment, featuring Catherine Zeta Jones and Sean Connery, was filmed at Duart Castle on Mull, and a scene for the popular family classic Ring of Bright Water was filmed a few miles outside Oban the house where Bill Travers’ character lived is still nearby.Cinema Gadelica was produced by Caledonia TV for BBC ALBA and is available now on BBC iPlayer."},{"url":null,"title":"district news december 25 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

After years of the charity campaigning, on December , the UK Government announced the framework for a future Online Harms Bill that has the potential to provide much greater protection for children when they use the internet.This is a landmark moment – a major step towards legislation that can make an enforceable legal duty of care on tech companies a reality. For too long children have been exposed to disgraceful abuse and harm online.Social media companies will have a duty to protect young users from child abuse and harmful content online and face fines of up to £ million or  per cent of their global turnoverthey fail.But that doesn’t mean that the work we do stops now. For instance, the proposals fall short of ensuring criminal sanctions against named directors whose companies fail to uphold their duty of care.Child protection and children’s voices must remain front and centre of regulatory requirements. We have set out six tests for robust regulation – including action to tackle both online sexual abuse and harmful content and a regulator with the power to investigate and hold tech firms to account with criminal and financial sanctions.Failing to pass any of the six tests will mean that future generations of children will pay with serious avoidable harm and sexual abuse.We will now be closely scrutinising the proposals against those tests. Above all, legislation must ensure Ofcom has the power and resources to enforce the duty of care and be able to identy and then take appropriate action against tech firms that fail.For more information, search ‘NSPCC six tests’.Joanna Barrett, policy and public affairs manager, NSPCC Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"mcconnachie claims dunavertys december medal","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There wis nae hoose tae get directions and he couldnae even see the silhouette orsquo the Lammermuirs tae give him a sense orsquo direction. He wis lost. But mair than that, he realised he wis gettin gye cauld, andhe didnae find shelter soon he may be deid afore the year wis.He minded his faitherrsquos sayin ldquowhen a deadly wind blaws, seek yer beild be it a hame or bush.

Finally the morn arrived as the sun rose frae the sea, and spread its golden rays across the land. Jamie pursquod himself up, hud a wee shoogle tae clear the snaw frae his claes and looked aroond.

I was always mesmerised by how quickly the rough landscape changed into a white wonderland like from the most beautul fairy tale. This was also the time that I associated with countless presents . Who does not like them !Now I still adore winter but for dferent reasons, namely for its wildle visitors to the country. Last month, I introduced you to one of them ndash the short-eared owl ndash and now it is time I presented my favourite winter migrant: the Bohemian waxwing.The sight of a waxwing can brighten up any winter day, regardless of how keen on birding you are. Two years ago, I was privileged to spend a fantastic afternoon with these birds.It was a chilling but sunny day. As my dad, who is a nature lover, was visiting me for Christmas, I took the opportunity to take him on a trip to Aberlady. This place is always rich in all sorts of wildle. I also knew that some waxwing sightings had been recorded earlier that week.As soon as we arrived, I spotted a rather big flock of birds that briefly circulated above our heads before disappearing towards the reserve. Everything happened so fast that I did not have enough time to pick up my binoculars for a closer look at the birds.We rushed towards a copse of rowan trees, where I knew the waxwings would most likely congregate. As we were coming closer, I could recognise the merry trill that these stunning birds make as they were happily feeding on berries. You may remember from my previous articles how careful I am when it comes to approaching wildle. This time was no dferent we took our time watching the waxwings from a distance, letting them get used to our presence. This is a great technique to signal to wildle that we are no threat to them.Suddenly, the flock was spooked by a dog and raised high in the sky for a split second before landing above our heads. My dad and I gave each other a knowing grin and started admiring the beautul creatures sitting merely a couple of metres away from us. This was an unusual moment to me as a wildle photographer: the birds were so close that my lens was too big to capture the scene! But that picture of waxwings having a feast right above me will stay in my memory for a long time.Waxwings are often mistaken for common starlings. These two species are similar in size and, to an extent, profile.However,you look closely, you should spot the peach-brown colouring of waxwingsrsquo plumage. An even closer look will reveal the real charm and beauty that these birds possess: the enlivening neutral base colours are accompanied by splashes of white and red in the wings and a strong yellow band at the base of the tail. The head is crowned by a distinctive crest, which can be raised or lowered depending on the birdrsquos mood. Adding to their appeal is the prominent black mask on their eyes.Waxwings are gregarious birds, who can form large flocks consisting of hundreds of iniduals. They breed in boreal forest that extends from Scandinavia through Russia and across to the Pacic coast.Waxwings are a forgiving subject to photograph they do not encounter humans within their breeding habitats, therefore are approachable on their winter grounds, providing a great opportunity to capture them feeding on colourful berry trees.Waxwings make a loud but cheerful trill as they scour the landscape looking for fruit.Berries are incredibly important for waxwings in the winter. These birds can eat up to twice their body weight, which makes around -, berries a day!Their diet changes during their breeding season as the birds switch to feeding on mosquitoes and midges.Our native rowan is their favoured tree, but they will happily feed on hawthorn, cotoneaster and rosehips as well as dried fruit.If waxwings are in the area and you do not have berries, they can be attracted into gardens using apple halves hung from a tree. It is common to spot waxwings in such ordinary places as supermarket car parks, as they often have ornamental shrubs with berries.This was my first year writing Zanrsquos Wildle Diary and I have greatly enjoyed sharing my stories and experiences with you. I hope you all had fun reading my column!If you have enjoyed my pictures this year and would like to see more, I now have Wildle Calendars  for sale.

Get a pressure washerWhile you might think a regular hose will do the job just fine,youre able to, we recommend getting a pressure washer to clean your car. These are able to offer more power when cleaning - especially when it comes to areas such as the wheel arches. Good pressure washers are available for under pound, and while this might seem a bit pricey at first, youll soon find they come in handy for all sorts of tasks.. Dont skip the pre-washGiving your car a pre-wash is important at the best of times, but even more so in winter. Essentially, before you actually touch the car, its important to get as much of that dirt off as possible.There are ious ways you can do this - including using snowfoam, which helps to loosen dirt. But our chosen method is using whats known as an all-purpose cleaner or citrus cleaner. Its best to wet the car first, before spraying these cleaners on, which can usually be heavily diluted and still pack impressive cleaning power. Always check the instructions and dilution ratios before using.Leave the cleaner on the vehicle for around five minutes before pressure washing the dirt off - youll be surprised by how much it removes.. Use two buckets and a dedicated car shampooWhile it can be tempting to grab the mop bucket and fill it with washing up liquid, this couldnt be further from what we recommend for cleaning your car.Washing up liquid contains ingredients that are designed to strip grease from pots and pans, but on a cars paint this can degrade the finishused on a regular basis. For that reason, a dedicated car shampoo should be used, and good products can be picked up for as little as a fiver.Following this, we recommend using two buckets - one containing the car shampoo mixture and the second nothing but clean water. Well explain why shortly.. Ditch the sponge and use a wash mittFor years, a sponge has been thought of as the ultimate tool for cleaning a car, but these can actually cause damage to your car.Even after a pre-wash, there will still be dirt on your car, and when using a sponge, these dirt particles have nowhere to go - so essentially youll be rubbing grit around on the car, which could cause marks to be inflicted. Instead, use a deep pile wash mitt, which helps to sort the issue.The process goes, dunk the mitt in the car shampoo bucket, clean the area youre doing, then put in the clean water bucket, rinse, repeat.. Clean top to bottomAnother important thing to remember when cleaning your car is the method. While it can be tempting to just rub around in circles, this can cause whats known as swirls, which ruin the way your car looks.Instead, you should aim to clean in straight lines, whether thats up and down, or side to side. You should also work from top to bottom - the roof and bonnet of your car being far less likely to have dirt on them than the lower . Once youve cleaned all , rinse the vehicle thoroughly.. Lay down some protectionEspecially in winter, its important to lay down some protection on your car, which will help to repel any dirt and also make future washing cleaner.While you can use a dedicated spray wax or paste wax for this, one of the quickest ways of doing this is to use a spray wax that you apply while the vehicle is wet after washing it. Spray this on the clean wet , before rinsing off straight away - youll immediately be able to tell the dference.. Dry off the carOnce youve rinsed off your car, it can be tempting to just leave it, but we always recommend drying off your vehicle - whether or not youve opted for step six.Use a microfibre towel for drying your car, which is able to soak up an impressive amount of water. If you just leave the water on your car to let it air-dry, it can leave water spots and also make it look a smeary mess."},{"url":null,"title":"269390760","story":"In the last few days of any year theres always that urge to tot things up, to take a measure of the  months youve just gone through and what you have ndash or more likely have not ndash achieved.

Think of it like a -page book where every so often a couple of letters randomly switch places as new copies are rushed off the press.Occasionally one of these mutations will confer a lsquoselective advantagersquo - such as making a virus more transmissible. As a general rule in virology, however, the more infectious a virus becomes the more its lethality dwindles.For example, the original  SARS killed around  per cent of people who caught it compared to the new SARS-CoV- version, which has an estimated case-fatality rate somewhere in the region of .-% . But SARS also ran out of steam and no case has been detected anywhere in the world since .A virusrsquo only goal is to be passed on and multiply, which is better achieved by being highly contagious - but not overly deadly.It remains to be seen of course whether this will turn out to be the case for the UK iant, which is estimated to be % more transmissible and as of mid-December was accounting for around % of all new cases in London.The UK and South Africa have experienced a huge surge in cases since the beginning of DecemberThere has been a suggestion that the iant may be more infectious in children after NERVTAG member Professor Neil Ferguson told journalists that the number of cases of the new iant detected in under-s is ldquosignicantly higher ldquothan other strains, but there is currently no published evidence to demonstrate that.: If only taking back control had applied to our borders in a pandemicThe South African mutation, dubbed .YV, has been detected in two locations in Britain - in London and the north-west of England.

As soon Alan gets the place shipshape, Irsquoll be getting on with that.The shed was the first thing we bought when we arrived at the cottage. Previously, a dilapidated wooden shack sagged near the back door. It was like a prop from Cold Comfort Farm, the door unable to open more than half a foot because so much gravel and mud had washed down the path.Within a week of moving in, it had been demolished and carted off, and from the fence by the field came the sound of hammering as a new shed was erected, just in time for Christmas. We ought to have tied a ribbon on it, because that year there was little chance of much in the way of more personal gts. Because of the slope, the shedrsquos front legs are longer than the back. It gave us a place to start gathering stuff like every other garden owner, and offered hedgehogs a safe retreat in the crawl space beneath, should they think about taking up residence.In the autumn, a neighbour took me into her beech hedge, which is so wide and high that you can stand upright in the centre. Here, among the sparrow roosts, she had installed a dinky wooden hedgehog house she had hammered together. Itrsquos the kind of property development everyone can embrace.Our local garden centre sells wicker versions, which are shaped like igloos. With a narrow entrance tunnel leading to a rounded chamber, they remind me of Maeshowe in Orkney.The roof of our hut is home to spiders, which occasionally are picked off when a robin darts inside, so swt a sortie itrsquos like a special operations mission. One hot day in our first summer here, I left the door ajar. I came back an hour later to discover wasps had begun to build bings. They were stuck to the walls like golf balls, getting larger by the minute.If only we had owned PPE in those days, wersquod have been able to swing into action immediately.As it was, it took a while to get a spray ndash kindly lent by a neighbour ndash and find a way of covering Alan top to toe. Wearing gloves, hood, and shirt buttoned to the neck, he went in looking like an international inspector investigating Chernobyl.He was back indoors before a kamikaze wasp was discovered crawling around inside his clothes, giving its all in defence of its realm. By the time Alan had ripped off and shaken out his shirt, he had been stung. The wasp, meanwhile, was even more injured, and when I finally found it on a windowsill, it had gasped its last.Now, we keep the shed door closed most of the time. Wasps are welcome to nest where, and in the past couple of years have burrowed underground beneath the birch tree and the beech hedge. Sometimes they buzz angrily as we pass, and occasionally I have been chased down the path until I am at a safe distance.On warm days, when Irsquom in the summer house, I can hear them on the walls outside, chewing at the wood and making pulp. They make a sound like a scratching fingernail. Who knew such a tiny creature could be such a noisy eater Around the winter solstice, when darkness is falling by mid-afternoon, summer is unimaginable. This year it feels particularly far off. The garden looks dank and dreary and, with its overlong grass, has an abandoned air. A friend offered his lawnmower for one last trim before winter, but by the time the rainclouds parted, everything was sodden. As a result, a trip to the shed or the summer house sounds like wading through water which, these past few weeks, is close to the truth.Irsquove been assiduously reading books that recommend what to plant to keep borders filled with colour all year round, but at the moment achieving that is a distant dream. Walking around Hoolet, I take notes of how people make their front gardens look more inviting. Looking at our own, I wonder how it is that when yoursquore out in the countryside, the tangle of dying undergrowth and grass is beautul, yet our better-tended patch looks unkempt and sorry for itself Not all is gloom. Shoots of spring bulbs are coming through. The first snowdrop has appeared, its flower dangling like a pearl earring, solitary and brave. Nearby, a couple of milky hellebores brighten up the flowerbed. One was given to us by a friend instead of a Christmas card last year, and we think of her whenever we pass.Before New Year arrives I will make a list of the plants in the garden, and who gave them to us. Itrsquos like a Whorsquos Who of Hoolet, from shrubs and flowers to bulbs and even ndash at the heart of them all ndash a young tree, seeded from a magnicent copper beech in the farmhouse across the green.

The other evening, as we were driving out of the village, a barn owl flew out of the hedgerow, uplit by our headlights as it flapped towards the fields.

Being a party politician or staffer, or perhaps worse an activist, tends to tribalise people and render them largely unable to see reason or appreciate nuance.This often leads to unsubstantiated braggery, which hovers around our politics like the smell of spoiled milk. Thatrsquos perpetually annoying. It also leads to emotional decision making, and therefore underperformance of people who, in other walks of le, would be successful.Most damagingly, though, this clouded perspective can often stle good government, with our rulers considering their administration to be performing better than it actually is and therefore not being prepared to change course. In short, they begin to believe their own publicity, and we all suffer.In Scotland, as in all democracies, there is a healthy dose of all of this. But there are also a few examples, on all sides, of politicians and advisers who are able to take a more dispassionate view of the performance of their tribe. These people are of real value ndash theyrsquore the change-makers.The Scottish Government has a good few of these rare beasts in its ranks of ministers and advisers. It is now that they need them.The SNP has been in government in Scotland for almost  years. I am hardly spoiling the upcoming Scottish Parliament election for Herald readers when I say that another five years beckon, perhaps as a majority, perhaps as a minority. And although there are some route maps to either the Conservatives or Labour inhabiting Bute House after the  elections, they are narrow and require the sort of expert steering that neither or those parties have so far shown themselves capable of.So the SNP it will be for  years, for sure, and likely for  years. Itrsquos an astonishingly long time to be in government, and represents the defiance of all accepted political gravity. With this longevity, and in truth with very little competition, it is devilishly dficult to stay fresh, to stay on top of the job, to innovate, to change.Time, then, for these change-makers. Letrsquos forget the opposition hype this is not an incompetent government. It is a government run by a group of extremely intelligent and committed people who, like all governments, can point to some successes and some failures.However, it is a government which is increasingly running into trouble in the key areas which really matter to voters. The recent IpsosMORI STV polling will not have gone unnoticed although trust ratings were high across the board, they were lowest on the issue of our schools.We are not short of old tropes about Scotland having a world leading education system, but we are short of evidence for it. The system is centred on the wishes of councils and unions, which iniably run counter to the needs of pupils and parents, who are often treated as an afterthought, at best, and an inconvenience at worst. Results are mediocre.And it is iniquitousyou want to make it to medical school and be a doctor in Scotland, for instance, there are a huge number of state schools in Scotland where statistics show that outcome is impossible. The ugly truth is that opportunity is maximised only for those children whose parents can afford a house in a good catchment area.And despite the Thursday night clapping and the \"Thank You NHS\" signs, healthcare is another looming source of trouble. As with schools, the facts render the national narrative delusional.Our NHS has  per cent fewer doctors per head than the OECD average. We have barely half the average number of hospital beds per head. We have less than half the number of MRI scanners, and one-third the number of CT scanners per head.We scrape into the OECD top- for survival rates for major cancers ndash colorectal, breast and cervical. We perform even worse ndash outside the top  ndash in mortality rates for heart attack, haemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke.Some fairly radical change is required for the next term of SNP government. It should start with the Cabinet, and not just the people in it, but the structure of it. They have a unique opportunity to do this one-third of the cabinet is standing down at the election.Irsquod reduce the number of cabinet secretaries and expand the number of ministers sitting underneath them. The structure and relationship between cabinet secretaries, ministers, and the special advisers who serve them, has become confused to the detriment of progress.Take rural affairs. The rural economy is bound up in sustainability, climate change and energy, yet these issues are split across, at my count, three ministers and four cabinet secretaries, and thatrsquos before we bring the matter of local authority planning into it. There are other examples, when we get into the weeds of this ndash the splitting of finance and economy for instance.Better to have a top-level cabinet reduced in size to, say, eight secretaries, with an expanded team of ministers with much clearer, more focused, more accountable remits.Being in government is hard. Being in government for more than a couple of decades is harder still. Fundamental renewal is not a concession of failure it is an acknowledgement that progress is impossible without change.Changing structures doesnrsquot change outcomes, but itrsquos a good place to start.bull Andy Maciver is Director of Message MattersOur columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

And unless the Labour Party in Scotland can re-connect with its core working-class communities the SNPrsquos dominion will stretch still further.The party had better hope that Scottish independence is delivered before then, thus enabling it to claim self-determination as its eternal gt to Scotland. Close scrutiny of its political bequest beyond the constitutional question does not yet tell of signicant improvements to the lives of most of its citizens.Certainly, Scotland feels like a warmer and more humane place to be than the current reality of le in England. The politics of Brexit and the darker cultural forces unleashed in its wake has seen our great southern neighbour reduced to a pariah state, still clinging to the frayed threads of empire.Set against this Scotland must seem like a cultural Xanadu: welcoming immigrants providing a haven for refugees and seeking to enable them to live and work here.Meanwhile, Nicola Sturgeon is flirting outrageously with the European Union as England accuses it of unreasonable behaviour throughout a stormy -year marriage and a messy orce.Yet the SNP still has work to doit wants its legacy to be regarded as a positive one for the majority of Scotlandrsquos citizens. Baby boxes and the free tuition grt cannot disguise the reality of working-class communities in Scotlandrsquos densely populated west Central Belt experiencing similar levels of deprivation to those they had to endure for decades before the SNP took office.Only a set of gentle breezes blowing in the SNPrsquos favour has prevented harsher scrutiny of its failure to improve the lives of its poorest citizens. The party has come into its majority at a time when Scottish Labour now resemble little more than a badly-run social work department. The people whom the Tories unearth in Scotland, meanwhile, are a warning to parents currently considering sending their children to a private school. With an opposition as feckless as this Scotland effectively has become a one-party state.Latterly, the SNP has been blessed by Boris Johnsonrsquos annexation of the UK Government. When the Union you wish to leave is run by a man who looks like Worzel Gummidgersquos shady uncle ndash but without the dress sense ndash the odds against the expressed fulfilment of your dream begin to sht in your favour, as theyrsquove been doing consistently in the last  opinion polls.Yet, in spite of such a benign political terrain  is shaping to be the most important year in the recent history of the SNP. Itrsquos the year when wersquoll get to learn how serious the partyrsquos leadership ever was about actual independence.For several years itrsquos been virtually certain that the party will gain an overall majority in favour of independence at the next Scottish election. Now they must show their workings to its own supporters. Itrsquos simply inconceivable that a party with its vast resources in finances, personnel and membership has no other strategy than one which they know must always fail: asking Worzel Gummidgersquos uncle to grant a Section  order.It will be interesting now to see how the partyrsquos newly-constituted NEC, lately freed from the grip of its designer radicals, aims to use its powers. Its immediate task is to force the party leadership actively to pursue an alternative to Section  featuring a determined and well-planned battle in the courts.With the identity extremists in the party now having been isolated and routed, the SNP now must ensure that they are never permitted to infect the party with their misogynistic poison again. It was only a matter of time before the true nature of these people would be exposed to communities with far more pressing concerns around le and death than gender reform. The damage they risked causing to SNP support in these places could have been grievous.Of much wider concern for the SNP is how they dismantle a growing suspicion in the wider radical Yes movement that they harbour an insidious neo-liberal strain in their leadership. These instincts could be observed once more yesterday as it was revealed it will face a legal challenge for its failure to implement a recovery programme in the Firth of Clyde, now ravaged by the activities of big industrial trawling concerns. The same dark forces were present in its failure to curtail driven grouse shooting on Scotlandrsquos vast landed estates. It pays these days for lobbying firms to meet the stf costs of having a presence at SNP conferences.If only the SNP could have found the same sense of purpose they deploy to cosy up to major landed and industrial concerns when trying to protect working-class jobs in Fe and Lewis which depended on the success of the BiFab manufacturing firm. Their abandonment of these communities to the fate of geo-political capitalism was the inevitable consequence of an incoherent renewables strategy, despite enjoying an abundance of natural advantages. A much more competent opposition would have damaged the SNP over this.The party must also use  to free itself from the influence of its pet lobbying firms and reveal the shady nexus of relationships that permit a few very rich and powerful people to influence economic and cultural policy in Scotland. In  the election of a Labour Government with three terms at its disposal held the beguiling promise of a game-changing, economic sht in favour of working-class communities. This was blown in the desire to placate the money-changers of global capitalism.The SNP has a few more years yet to ensure they donrsquot stand accused at the end of their reign of wasting the opportunity to rule in favour of the many and not the few.

Fortunately little use,any, had to be made of those units specically equipped to deal with such an outcome. Now there is a real threat of the NHS being overwhelmed as a result of the accelerated spread of the new iant.However,there is insufficient personnel to staff them without leaving all other hospitals short, what real value is there in those units except as empty showcases to prove intent without the backup to allow them to operate effectively Isolation of Covid patients in Covid-only facilities is what is needed instead of hospitals having to house Covid patients as well as all patients with other health conditions, which allows the spread of the virus within hospitals to the detriment of those whose immune system is low owing to age or other conditions along with the stress the pandemic places on overstretched NHS employees.We have not experienced this type of outbreak within most peoples living memory and our politicians appear to be all at sea over how to handle this matter in a way to limit contagion.When we come through this crisis, the findings of any inquiry into how the situation was handled will pinpoint the blind spots and incompetencies of those whom we have trusted to help keep us safe.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.WORKING OUT THE COVID FIGURESI FREQUENTLY read quotes and letters in The Herald and where comparing the rate of coronavirus infection in Scotland with the UK, usually to make a political point. Sometimes figures are given, sometimes not. When they are, they can be presented in dferent ways. This must be quite confusing for readers.The Herald publishes the confirmed cases for Scotland and the UK in its Daily Update. Without coming down on one side or the other, can I suggest two fairly simple ways of comparing them for yourself Firstly, for confirmed cases, simply ide the UK figure by  to compare it with Scotlandrsquos .Secondly, rates are sometimes quoted as \"weekly cases per , of the population\". To calculate this for Scotland, ide the confirmed cases by eight and yoursquoll be pretty close . For the UK, iding the confirmed cases by  will be about right. This assumes that the number of confirmed cases on that particular day is typical of the whole week.So next time you wonder about the figures being bandied about, look up The Herald, work them out for yourself and see whether or not the claims are justied.Colin Pennycook, Glasgow G.CHANGE IS URGENTLY NEEDEDTO quote Ruth Marr , \"weve heard it all before and nobody will buy it for Christmas, let alone for le\". I wish to echo her sentiments however, certainly not in relation to Gordon Brown, but in respect of her beloved SNP. Later in her letter, Ms Marr expounds \"a confident Scotland which increasingly sees its future as a modern European nation, not tied to a diminished UK\".Where does she get her rose-coloured spectacles from After more than  years of SNP Government with incompetence on every level ndash health, education, police, business purchases, ferry design and building, bridge design, and the latest, drug abuse deaths ndash we need a change. And I am quite sure that I speak for the silent majority of Scots, who do love their country but will make sure it remains part of the potentially growing UK and no longer part of the European Community, which has little to look forward to now that we have left ndash stagnation, bankruptcy and collapse.Boyd Houston, Dollar.LETS LOOK TO IRELANDIN the debate on Scottish independence we should take a look at the independent country next door, the Republic of Ireland.

When asked \"how much, per capita, do the people of Scotland contribute to the Exchequer , the response was: ldquoThose figures are not available. Not to worry, though, the Tories had a catchphrase to parrot.The truth, of course, is summed up by these two sentences from the Business for Scotland web page, ldquoWhere does Scotlandrsquos wealth go .

Named Woven Sound, it contains extracts from the diary of poet Dorothy Wordsworth at the end of its caged viewpoint, the details of which will encourage you to properly embrace the surroundings rather than just snapping a picture and walking away. Be warned though that while beautul it can be slightly frightening to look down through the walkway and see a sheer drop to the water below.Southerness Beach, DumfriesThis wide, sandy beach is quiet enough that you will have the place mostly to yourself, yet it falls within the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and offers some views out towards Cumbria and beyond.

Wersquore not going to regress, and yoursquod expect that, he told the Sunday .Nonetheless, Mr Johnson did acknowledge that the treaty ldquoperhaps does not go as far as we would like over access to EU markets for financial services.But he said Rishi Sunak was ldquodoing a big exercise on business taxes and regulation alongside a ldquogreat Government effort for change in the new year.The Chancellor said the nation would be able to ldquodo things a bit dferently now, referencing new opportunities for the financial sector, stressing the trade deal should leave those anxious about the financial impact ldquoenormously reassured.ldquoThis deal can represent an enormously unying moment for our country and bring people together after the isions of the past few years, declared Mr Sunak.But Barrie Deas, Chief Executive of the National Federation of Fishermenrsquos Organisation, accused Mr Johnson of having ldquobottled it on fishing quotas to secure only ldquoa fraction of what the UK has a right to under international law.He said the PM had ldquosacriced fishing to other priorities, with the subject proving to be an enduring sticking point during negotiations.A hasty analysis of the treaty secured on Christmas Eve began in earnest when it was published in full on Boxing Day ndash less than a week before its implementation.The self-styled ldquostar chamber of lawyers led by veteran Eurosceptic MP Sir Bill Cash and assembled by the European Research Group of Tory Brexiteers was expected to reveal its verdict tomorrow.But there were indications Brexit hardliners were preparing to support the deal, despite being angered by the little time they have to debate it.Meanwhile, Ian Blackford, the SNPrsquos leader in Westminster, made clear his party would vote against the ldquounforgivable act of economic vandalism and gross stupidity which he argued is a ldquovery bad deal for Scotland.Elsewhere, Liz Truss, the International Trade Secretary, said she expected to sign a continuity trade agreement with Turkey this week, a move that was not possible until the deal with the EU was struck because Ankara is in a customs union with the bloc."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-daily-figures-show-967-new-cases","story":"Daily figures released by the Scottish Government revealed a total of positive infections were identied.A total of  new tests for Covid- reported results, of which.% of these were positive.The positivity rate is slightly lower than yesterdays, which was reported as .%.:This is how your areas statistics have changed in the last nine monthsDaily updates are being affected by the festive period, with officials only publishing data on the number of new cases of Covid- and the test positivity rate.The number of recent deaths has not been updated as a result of this.:Scots health expert predicts there will be a cost for Christmas Day household mixingThe latest daily data for deaths and hospital admissions will be released on Tuesday, December , which will include data for that day as well as the previous four days.A statement on the Scottish Governments website reads: \"During the festive period, daily updates will be published to provide the latest data on the number of new cases of COVID- and thetestpositivity rate.\"Over the holiday weekends of - December and - January there will be no updates to the remaining statisticsndash you can access the latest available data in the sections below.\"These will be updated on Tuesday  December and Tuesday  January ndash we will provide the latest daily data for that day and the previous  days.\""},{"url":null,"title":"gove-britain-faces-bumpy-moments-end-transition-heralds-new-era-eu-red-tape","story":"Michael Gove admitted there would be ldquosome disruption for travellers and businesses as the country ended its -year membership of the Euro club.The Cabinet Office Minister, with a deal of understatement, said there would be some ldquobumpy moments as the -month transition period ended and the full reality of Brexit finally took shape.His comments came as ambassadors from the EU unanimously approved the provisional application of the historic UK-EU Trade and Co-operation Agreement, without tarfs or quotas and worth some pound billion, and as MPs and peers prepared to vote on it tomorrow. With Labourrsquos support, it should pass comfortably. The European Parliament is expected to raty it next month.UK businesses are being encouraged to make sure they understand the new rules on the importing and exporting of goods, including the dferent rules that apply to trade with Northern Ireland, and to consider how they will make customs declarations on trade with the EU.It emerged online shoppers who buy items from the EU valued at more than pound will from this week have to pay customs duties. Handling fees and VAT could also apply on some items. This means that parcels face being held up in post offices until those fees and duties have been paid.Mr Gove encouraged travellers to EU destinations from Friday to make sure they had at least six months left on their passports, took out comprehensive travel insurance and checked their mobile phone providers roaming charges.He said: ldquoIm sure there will be bumpy moments but we are there to try to do everything we can to smooth the path.\"The minister warned businesses that time was now \"very short\" to make the final preparations before the transition period came to a close at pm on Thursday.\"The nature of our new relationship with the EU - outside the Single Market and Customs Union - means that there are practical and procedural changes that businesses and citizens need to get ready for.\"We know that there will be some disruption as we adjust to new ways of doing business with the EU, so it is vital that we all take the necessary action now,\" he added.But Mr Goversquos words were denounced by Labour and the SNP.Rachel Reeves, his Labour Shadow, said: ldquoThe Government is treating its own incompetence as inevitable.\"There is no reason why the deal the Government ended up with had to be run so close to the wire, nor why this period must be bumpy had the Government prepared properly.\"But, instead, they refused to engage with business on preparations and dodged repeated questions from Labour for months on how many customs agents were recruited and ready, and what IT systems are properly in place.\"They should behave like grown-ups and take responsibility for governance,\" added Ms Reeves.Alison Thewliss for the SNP described Mr Goversquos comments about disruption and bumpy moments as the ldquounderstatement of the century, warning the country would be faced with a ldquomountain of extra costs, red tape and barriers to trade.The Glasgow MP declared: ldquoThe Tory Government is wilfully damaging peoples jobs, businesses and the economy at the worst possible time during a global pandemic and economic recession.She argued a hard Tory Brexit could cut Scotlands GDP by as much as . per cent and cost the nation pound billion, the equivalent of pound, per person.ldquoIts no wonder the Tories are desperate to rush it through with as little scrutiny as possible, Ms Thewliss insisted.The SNPrsquos Treasury spokeswoman added: \"People across Scotland and the UK will also see their EU benefits gradually stripped away, including our precious freedom of movement rights to live, work, study and travel freely across Europe, and will be hit with increased costs, including travel insurance and roaming charges.\"If people and businesses are unprepared it is because the Tories have left it to the last minute on their own arbitrary deadline and are now imposing a hard Brexit, causing months of uncertainty for those that rely on our relationship with the EU.As part of the preparation for Brexit proper, an agreement has been reached for a Dumfries and Galloway airfield to be used by hundreds of lorries in case of any post-Brexit disruption at Cairnryan port.The Scottish Government has signed a lease with Stair Estates, owner of Castle Kennedy airfield in Stranraer, beginning on Friday as part of Operation Overflow, a contingency plan developed by Transport Scotland and partners including Police Scotland, PO and Stena.Up to  goods vehicles can park at the site with welfare facilitiesport capacity is too high as freight continues to travel between Scotland and Northern Ireland.Michael Matheson, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Transport Secretary, said: ldquoAt this stage we do not expect a signicant increase in traffic or delays at Cairnryan, but it is essential that we are prepared for every eventuality.As Westminster prepares for a landmark vote on the trade deal, it emerged that most of Northern Irelandrsquos  MPs are not expected to back it.The DUP said its eight MPs would vote against the agreement nor will the SDLPrsquos two backbenchers or the Alliance Partyrsquos sole representative.The regionrsquos remaining seven seats are held by Sinn Fein, whose MPs historically never taken their places in the Commons.In a statement, the DUP said its MPs would vote against the deal ldquoas a point of principle and ldquonot because we supported a no-deal option.Earlier this week, the SNP made clear it would oppose the trade deal, which, it claimed, would be disastrous for Scotland.Ian Blackford, the partyrsquos leader at Westminster, described the agreement as an \"unforgiveable act of economic vandalism and gross stupidity\".He added: \"This is a very bad deal for Scotland, which will terminate our membership of the EU, rip us out of the worlds largest single market and customs union, end our freedom of movement rights, and impose mountains of red tape, added costs and barriers to trade for Scottish businesses.But Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, took the Nationalists to task, branding them hypocrites.\"Yet again Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP are putting their own narrow self-interest above those of our country, declared the Moray MP.\"In doing so, they expose their rank hypocrisy. They have spent months loudly warning about no-deal yet now they are going to vote for exactly that.\"They are willing to risk Scottish jobs and the economy for political posturing.

The Government committed then to help producers in case of severe disruption – now it is time we saw what support will be forthcoming. This week may be just a foretaste of the challenges coming in the new year, deal or no deal, so it is essential that our businesses can have a measure of confidence from the Government.”Shetland MSP, Beatrice Wishart said: “This is an incredibly serious situation. While reasonable public health measures are needed to control the spread of the virus, the government must do all it can to ensure island food exporters can get their perishable goods to market, at what is the busiest time of the year.“Michael Gove told me at a committee session last week that, for seafood exports after Brexit, government #will ensure that, in Kent, we do not have the type of traffic disruption that some have feared#. This disruption does not bode well for the end of the transition period in a just over a week’s time. The UK Government must urgently organise an extension to mitigate economic damage and help our vital food and drink businesses.”Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur said: “Businesses across the Highlands and Islands simply can’t afford to contend with the level of disruption in exports currently being seen. Any delay in exporting perishable goods risks dire consequences for businesses in Orkney, already having to cope with tight deadlines.“At the end of the most challenging of years, further financial turmoil is the last thing small businesses in the islands need heading into . The UK Government’s determination to press ahead with Brexit at any and all cost appears utterly reckless.“The very least that businesses across the Highlands and Islands deserve is support to mitigate the economic impact they face. It’s vital the UK Government now comes forward with urgent measures to head off this impending crisis.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

No inter-island ferries are operating on Christmas Day and Boxing Day.OIC chief executive John Mundell said: #With no recent cases of COVID- in Orkney — and with strict restrictions on travel in and out of the county due to come into force — we believe this is a proportionate and safe move to make in the interests of equality for all people in our community.“However, we would ask folk travelling on the ferries to keep themselves and our crews safe by following current health and hygiene advice — in just the same way as they have been over many weeks and months. It is also important that folk continue to watch for any further announcements by the Scottish Government.”The news was welcomed by Orkney#s MSP, Liam McArthur.Constituents had contacted Mr McArthur, concerned at the plans to restrict travel, leading to discussions with Orkney Ferries, OIC and Scottish Ministers.A pleased Mr McArthur said the additional flexibility would come as a great relief to many isles residents and their families.“While additional care certainly needs to be taken, and travel and gatherings should be avoided wherever possible, it’s right that people in Orkney are able to travel within their local authority area in the same way as people in every other part of the country,# said Mr McArthur.“I have been contacted by many constituents over the past  hours, surprised and concerned at the prospect of more robust restrictions being put in place for those living in the isles.

Orkney is an exception to this, and will instead be placed in Level Three.She advised that school holidays across Scotland will be extended to January , after which pupils will resume learning online. It is hope that pupils may be able toto schools physically by January .Ahead of announcing the news that Scotland would be enhancing restrictions nationwide, come Boxing Day, the First Minister said that, while she understood why some areas with a relatively low number of cases may be disappointed by this news, she would direct them to figures showing the rapid increase in cases in the south east of England in just the past few days.#My judgement is,we do nothing or do to little now, then things will get much than they need to be,# Ms Sturgeon said:She added: #I know how harsh this sounds.

Orkney continues to be in the unique position of having very few cases of Covid-, with no new cases reported for a considerable number of weeks.“It is our argument that nurseries and schools should be open as normal and remain so for as long as this remains safe # for the sake of academic progression, for the health and wellbeing of our young people, and for the economic prosperity of our community.“Too many of our vulnerable children and young people continue to be seriously disadvantaged because poor or no connectivity in many parts of Orkney means they do not have access to the internet therefore to remote learning. It means they continue to miss out on so much, which is extremely unfair. Without a fullto school early in January, many working parents will also be disadvantaged by having to provide unplanned childcare.“If we receive special permission from the Scottish Government to fully re-open as originally planned, we will noty families, carers and staff as soon as possible in January with updated information about this. Talks with the Government will resume on Monday January .”Current timetable for schools opening in January The Scottish Government has granted the council an exceptional closure day on Wednesday  January. All schools and nurseries will be closed to allow staff to plan and prepare for the unique arrangements they need to have in place.School transport and the School Meals Service will operate as normal from Thursday  January.From the  January, the children of key workers and vulnerable children should attend school or nursery for face-to-face learning. All other children and young people will be provided with remote learning at home.It is hoped that from Monday  January, nurseries and schools will be open as usual for all children and young people.Halls residents eligible for childcare during the period  to  January should attend their island school.Whilst correct at the time this update was issued, the information provided is subject to change. Please keep an eye on government announcements, the OIC Updates Facebook page and the council’s website www.orkney.gov.ukIn the case of children considered to be vulnerable, there will be no requirement for parents or carers to apply for a place at school or nursery from January . Schools will contact families direct on January  to discuss arrangements. The Scottish Government has instructed local authorities to broaden the definition of vulnerability to ensure that children experiencing any signicant disadvantage which may impact negatively on future attainment are included in this group.If you are a key worker, as defined by the categories below, did not previously apply for childcare but now require it, please complete the application form www.smartsurvey s OIC-Childcare  as soon as possible.Category  – All workerswithout whom there could be a signicant impact on Scotland.Please note that you should not expect to hear whether your child has a place until Wednesday January .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Almost a decade, and many awards, later Meena says, “In the beginning, we used to recommend people use the salt in salads but then we started adding it to all our food. It’s great as it doesn’t dominate the taste but just melts into and improves the flavour of all types of dishes, and you only need to use a small amount.” Indeed, feedback from a repeat customer confirms this: “I love cooking with your salt and think about its purity and provenance every time.” Meena added, “These kind of comments bring joy to our hearts!”Fellow director, Chris Watts adds, “We have always looked at the business in a holistic way, with eco-credentials at the heart of the business, from production to the packaging design to the end product. We are very proud to be part of the Scottish Food and Drink Industry, which we know will continue to thrive.”Asked how Isle of Skye Sea Salt had been affected by the Covid- pandemic, Meena replied, “Like most businesses, we’ve had a challenging year. Initially, we had to adjust and focus on our producer partners and increasing online custom until our catering and retail customers were also able to re-open in the latter half of the season. The eco-credentials, provenance, texture and taste have all made a dference to repeat orders. Every order matters to us. We are keen to promote the Isle of Skye brand. We would like to say a really big thank you to all our supporters chefs, collaborators, online and local buyers. Our hearts go out to businesses that have put in as much effort as us but perhaps haven’t survived. Hearing about the vaccine, we feel there is light at the end of the tunnel. We really feel positive about the future and hope that with the support available many of them will be able to start again.”Recent collaborations with Graham’s Family Dairy on an Isle of Skye Sea Salt butter, Chocolates of Glenshiel and COCO Chocolatier Isle of Skye Sea Salt have every reason to feel positive about the future.

We first met in Thailand and then lived together in Australia for three years, before ing to Janice’s hometown in Ireland for a year. The year we spent in Ireland gave us time to decide where we were going to put down some permanent roots. We knew, after a number of visits to see family, that Skye was where we ultimately wanted to be.“However, with Janice being an operating room nurse, she struggled to find a full time job on Skye.

Upon reaching the destination, a seafood feast is served.“Often, during our trips, we pass our family fishing boats,” says Ewen. “We love to allow our guests to see how the creels are hauled and where their lunch has been caught.”“This was a stressful, confusing time but we had good policies and guidelines to keep us on the right track,” Ewen added.“Our first adaptation was purchasing an antiviral fogging machine to ensure that the inside areas of the boat were as clean and safe as possible for each of our guests. It was also essential to increase the level of daily cleaning around the boat.“Maximum capacity was reduced from  guests to , and more seating and tables were provided to allow guests to spread out. Passenger access to the indoor areas was limited, which made trips more susceptible to disruption in poor weather conditions.“However, the main dference was that each group onboard had to have a private dining experience.

Health officials have asked family doctors to draw up lists of patients in the over- cohort to receive the AstraZeneca Oxford University jab once it has been given the go-ahead. It is the latest development in the largest and most complex mass vaccination programme ever carried out. Approval of the AstraZeneca Oxford University vaccine by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyis considered signicant as it is cheaper and much easier to distribute and store than the Pfizer vaccine currently being used by the health trusts. GPs will administer the AstraZeneca jab to their patients, beginning by offering it to anyone over the age of , when it has been approved.It is believed the programme will start within the next week, with Northern Ireland to receive ,, doses in total over the course of the programme. Meanwhile, a leading GP has said it is likely that younger people who received shielding letters will be invited to attend Covid- vaccination clinics in February, depending on availability of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Dr Alan Stout, chair of the BMA GP committee in Northern Ireland, said: We#re obviously very dependent on the MHRA, but we#re anticipating, and certainly what we#re hearing and hoping, is that the AstraZeneca vaccine will be approved early this week. That will change things dramatically.There is no question that it#s going to be the real workhorse of the vaccines and it#s going to be our way out of this pandemic. The vaccine is already being delivered to surgeries, and both the Department of Health and Health  Social Care Board have contacted GPs to ask practices to be prepared so that as soon as we get confirmation that the vaccine is safe, we will start calling people in. We will be starting with the over-s, then the over-s, over-s, over-s, and that will include those who are considered clinically extremely vulnerable to the virus. We would hope that younger people who are clinically extremely vulnerable will start to receive the vaccine in early February. This programme will vaccinate the most vulnerable first, and alongside the care homes, it means there will be a completely dferent environment, which is hugely exciting. The uptake in care homes is % - that has been achieved with the most dficult vaccine to administer logistically, to the most dficult group, simply because the vaccine has to go to them.So it is an incredible piece of work and a great start to the vaccination programme.The programme to vaccinate care home residents and staff began earlier this month after the MHRA gave the green light for the Pfizer BioNTech jab. Due to the fact that it must be stored at minus  degrees, it was not possible for it to be administered by GPs. However, the AstraZeneca vaccine, which costs around £ per dose, can be stored in a normal fridge, meaning it can be easily delivered to and stored at primary care facilities. Trials of the vaccine showed an efficacy rate of % when people were given half a dose followed by a whole dose at least a month later.Belfast Most ReadBBC NI#s Donna Traynor toto the screen following three-month absence Belfast brothel breaking Covid rules, say neighbours GP surgeries given supplies of AstraZeneca #workhorse# vaccine ahead of its approvalCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases in  hours as Swann warns against New Year#s Eve partiesNorthern Ireland Christmas swims : Brave souls make a splash as they take festive dip in the seaLatest CoronavirusPSNI won#t take action on taxis #operating in an essential manner# during curfewCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases in  hours as Swann warns against New Year#s Eve partiesMichelle O#Neill#s refusal to endorse UK-wide Covid initiative #reckless#Michelle O#Neill did not endorse public health message despite experts# adviceLatest from Belfast Queen#s and Ulster University can join new UK scheme and ErasmusQA: How the Brexit deal will impact your everyday leFinal lorry drivers set to cross to France following week of border disruption in review: The  people we said goodbye to in Revealed: , fines since  from just a single bus lane camera ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That same night his condition began to improve.The video has since gone viral, racking up around half-a-million views on YouTube, as well as being circulated on social media and being picked up by Christian publications and television stations globally.DeVon Franklin, the Hollywood producer of several Christian films, saw the video and contacted the preacher about turning his story into a feature- production, the Sunday Times reported.Mr Franklin is best known for Miracles From Heaven, which starred Queen Latah and Jenner Garner and is based on the memoir of a woman who claims her daughter was cured of a terminal illness.He also produced Breakthrough, which made more than mat the box office.The film, which could be available to stream on Netflix by next Christmas, will focus on Pastor McClelland#s experience with coronavirus, his church and the viral video in which he recalled his encounter with the hospital cleaner.No title for the production has yet been released, although the screenplay is to be written by Randy Brown, who penned the script for Miracles From Heaven and Trouble With The Curve, a  film starring Clint Eastwood. The movie, which had broadly good reviews from the critics, went on to gross mworldwide.In the video, McClelland said: When no one  could get in, God sent a cleaner. He also explained in the video that, as he started to feel better, he had a craving for crisps and a soft drink.I asked the Lord, because nobody could get to me, is it possible you could get me a packet of prawn cocktail crisps and a tin of Coke, he said.The next morning the cleaner came and he brought in a bag, and in that bag were two oranges, a tin of Coke and packet of prawn cocktail crisps, Tayto.The pastor, who did not identy the cleaner in the video, said the man told him he had been a missionary in Nigeria for  years.Thank you to that cleaner, you know who you areyou ever see this, thank you for hearing the voice of God and reaching someone like me, who needed a touch, he added.Last week the pastor revealed that he did know the name of the cleaner, but said he wanted to remain anonymous, the Sunday Times reported. He also claimed he had experienced a miracle, as he has no lingering health issues as a result of the virus.He said he had agreed to the film being made because he felt the producer was genuine and would put across the point and the purpose and the content of the miracle, and all that happened. It#ll be a story of hope in the midst of chaos, he added.Belfast Most ReadBBC NI#s Donna Traynor toto the screen following three-month absence Belfast brothel breaking Covid rules, say neighbours GP surgeries given supplies of AstraZeneca #workhorse# vaccine ahead of its approvalCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases in  hours as Swann warns against New Year#s Eve partiesNorthern Ireland Christmas swims : Brave souls make a splash as they take festive dip in the seaLatest Northern IrelandQueen#s and Ulster University can join new UK scheme and ErasmusQA: How the Brexit deal will impact your everyday le in review: The  people we said goodbye to in Revealed: , fines since  from just a single bus lane camera Majority of Northern Ireland MPs will not back Brexit trade dealLatest from Belfast Queen#s and Ulster University can join new UK scheme and ErasmusQA: How the Brexit deal will impact your everyday leFinal lorry drivers set to cross to France following week of border disruption in review: The  people we said goodbye to in Revealed: , fines since  from just a single bus lane camera ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye Michael McHughDecember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailFor most people Christmas morning involves relaxing in front of the tree, opening presents and enjoying a mince pie.But a group of intrepid swimmers opted to start the big day with a festive dip.It was C as they entered the sea for a bracing swim in Co Down yesterday.Festive jumpers were peeled off but reindeer and Santa hats remained on as members of a local club walked down the slipway and into the Irish Sea with barely a flinch.A pale winter sun and the whitewashed Donaghadee lighthouse provided the backdrop.Kathleen Monteverde said it was an exhilarating experience, adding: It is something I always admired other people doing and never thought I could do it.I started in February and aiming to go the whole year for the first time.She began sea swimming using a wet suit and that morphed into skin swimming.It definitely wakes you up and gets you ready for the day because Christmas can be very stressful - it is so busy, she added.It is great, you just get grounded and ready for the day.She said it was also a mindful experience: You feel the cold going up every part of you and you just enjoy it.It is really stimulating but it is about the company as well and having new friends.Numbers had been expected to be limited this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, increasing infection rates and pressure on health services.But even with a strict lockdown looming, there was still a cheery atmosphere at the harbour, with one woman dancing in the waves.Jill McClements said her mother was  and had been swimming for  years in Newcastle, Co Down, extolling the benefits in friendship and how good it left her feeling.She added: This is the first year I am swimming through the winter and I think she is really delighted.In fact, I think I am the favourite daughter at the moment.At Portrush, meanwhile, thrill-seekers headed to the beach for a spot of surfing, riding the waves as they came crashing in to the shore.People also hit the seaside in other parts of the UK.At Portobello Beach in Edinburgh, hardy swimmers, some wearing antlers and Santa hats, were seen dashing into the water to splash around despite air temperatures being °C. Even a dog joined in with the fun after chasing its owner into the water.The chilly temperatures followed early morning snowfall in parts of the UK, with the Met Office declaring it a White Christmas. Reports of snow had come in from Leconfield in Humberside and Wattisham in Suffolk as of am on Christmas morning. But the arrival of Storm Bella today will bring downpours and winds of up to -mph in exposed coastal locations.

And the leading lady was also among a host of local stars who brought some festive magic to the streets of Londonderry.It was literally a case of she’s behind you as north west based theatre company Blue Eagle Productions staged a quick-fire version of the fairytale classic in a number of local housing estates.With the well-known panto cast from the Millennium Forum away from their usual venue closed due to the COVID- restrictions, producer director Jonathan Burgess ensured the popular live show would still go on in a new outdoor format apty titled as ‘The Show In Your Street’.The fun and frolics of the traditional Christmas show were instead transported to local communities in the Waterside area of the city for six evenings of street entertainment.The unexpected treat featured the stars of previous local pantomimes with Cinderella played by Rachael O’Connor Andrew Porter as Buttons the Ugly Sisters Keith Lynch and James Lecky Conor O’Kane as Prince Charming and the Fairy Godmother Orla Mullan.Thanks to Organisations Emergency Programme funding from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and Department for Communities, the performances lted spirits and provided some light relief for adults and children alike who are missing out on all the festive shows which usually take place in schools, theatres and community centres during the Christmas and new year period.Blue Eagle Productions producer director Jonathan Burgess was delighted at the response from the local communities where ‘The Show In Your Street’ brightened up a few otherwise uneventful winter evenings for many households as a result of the ongoing restrictions to reduce the transmission of COVID- within the community.Jonathan said: “With so many indoor theatre events cancelled, we wanted to bring some of the magic of a live show to actual audiences in a safe but amusing way. The idea was that we would take the show to the people, travelling around ious locations where they would be able to view it from their windows, gardens or front walls while still maintaining social distance from other households.”“We encouraged people to keep well apart from their neighbours to ensure the health and safety of the community was not compromised and the show could continue as planned. Everyone did exactly what was asked of them and this meant we were able to proceed in the spirit intended.”“By staging the -minute production multiple times over the six consecutive dates, we managed to strike the perfect balance of having an appreciative audience without crowding the area and therefore keeping everyone safe while entertained.”.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news cb .ece AUTOCROP w eeeadccd.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news cb .ece AUTOCROP w eeeadccd.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news cb .ece AUTOCROP w eeeadccd.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news cb .ece AUTOCROP w eeeadccd.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news cb .ece AUTOCROP w eeeadccd.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  .\"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news cb .ece AUTOCROP w eeeadccd.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news cb .ece AUTOCROP w eeeadccd.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news cb .ece AUTOCROP w eeeadccd.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news cb .ece AUTOCROP w eeeadccd.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news cb .ece AUTOCROP w eeeadccd.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  .\"The Show in You Street presentation of Cinderella at Eskaheen View, Derry, by Blue Eagle Productions.

We shouldn’t invade their space. We’ve driven them out of Facebook already.“They find it boring because old people are on trying to be funny.“Young people aren’t impressed by that kind of thing.“I do have a TikTok account. I think it’s hilarious, a lot of it.“Some people are really, really inventive with the things that they do.“I do like going through it and wasting time watching it. But I honestly think it should be left for young ones.“They need a space that’s not invaded by oldies.”Fr Pat gained a following from all over the world for his livestreamed masses, including viewers in Norway, Australia and the US.“We actually had to change the mass time to accommodate viewers in America because it was a bit early for them,” he said.Combining meditation and prayer with humour and musical numbers on his ukulele, he quickly became an online hit.He said: “The whole thing evolved from the beginning when the lockdown happened and there was nobody allowed in the chapel.“It was very hard.“I had never said mass on my own.“Some priests do, when they don’t have a public mass they say one privately.“But I tried it once and I was very uncomfortable with it.“I didn’t know how to it.“You know when you say ‘the Lord be with you’, do you say the answer back to yourself “But I did find that the camera was a help.“I knew there was some people watching.”People were telling each other about it and they seemed to feel that there was something in it for themFather Pat WardHe added: “There was a lot of fear at that time too.“I was trying to talk calmly to people about the situation we were in.“It kind of evolved then into meditation.“Because I was on my own, I brought the ukulele just for company.“People liked that too, and I made up a few songs, I made up an Our Father song and a few others.“It just took off, people seemed to like it.“People were telling each other about it and they seemed to feel that there was something in it for them.“Something that calmed them in a time of uncertainty and they felt it was something that they needed. I was quite happy with that.”Fr Pat was stunned to receive his inspirational hero award in November after being nominated by his parishioners.He said: “It’s very embarrassing.“Especially when there’s doctors and nurses doing their damnedest to save everybody’s lives.“This kind of came out of the blue.“It’s an honour but I really think there’s somebody  who deserves it.“But I accepted it because it lted my parish.“The parishioners, they were chuffed.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The piece, entitled New Dawn, Renewal, Abundance, was completed by local artist Sara Cunningham-Bell after Dungiven Regeneration Club received council funding for the project. Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council held a consultation with the group, whose members are drawn from dferent backgrounds within the community, to shape the project. “They asked what was signicant about the local area and we came up with artistic ideas,” said Denis McHenry, one of the groups members. “We made our submission and it was scored and then the artists came back with five or six dferent pieces and we were involved in picking one. googletag.cmd.push The hare represents the nearby mountains. “Its an Irish hare, a native species and its representing the Sperrins and then you have the river on the background. Its perfect for a town like Dungiven in a rural setting. “Its very unique as well. Sometimes art can be similar, but this is dferent. Its going to become a talking point.” The sculpture consists of a native Irish hare mounted on a stone podium, with a stainless steel feature behind the hare, and decorated with a number of mots that symbolise dferent aspects of the town. At its unveiling last Thursday, artist Sara Cunningham-Bell told the assembled members of the group it was important the piece was in tune with the character of the local area. googletag.cmd.push “I think for it to be signicant, it needs to listen to where its going and who is going to see it,” she said. “This river element, this stainless steel, is representing our three rivers, which are going around the town of Dungiven and is reflective of the water that reflects the colour around it. “Its reflective of us as we pass by. Its got three names on the front of it New Dawn, Renewal, Abundance. Theyre all positive, dynamic words that are pointing us in the direction of the hare. “This is actually a female hare and the hare is one of Irelands oldest mammals. It was here in the last Ice Age, , years ago, and it has learned to adapt and support its family through huge change.     “The families of Dungiven have also learned to adapt and change and support their families the same way. The hare is symbolic of that. “Weve got this road going past Dungiven, but that wont change how strong we are as a community. The hare is saying we are dynamic, strong, a solid community. The work reflects the artist: Sara Cunningham-Bell is behind the piece. “The community markings are there, etched onto the polished stainless steel. The stone at the bottom is representative of the hidden stones at the bottom of the river beds. “It symbolises something that has weathered over time, but its there, its solid, its strong.” In what has been a dficult year, the community in the town has pulled together and Dungiven Regeneration Club are hoping the sculpture can provide the town with a further lt. “People will be asking who was involved and what it is. There are people from all sorts of backgrounds here,” said Denis McHenry. “Its a good way to get the community together, and its a long time since Dungiven had something like this. Its good to see it.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It comes of after a decision not to grant elite status to minor teams to allow the Ulster and Leinster championships to continue as planned. Derry were due to play Tyrone this Sunday, with champions Monaghan set to face Fermanagh in the other Ulster semi-final. The Leinster final between Meath and Offaly was also pencilled in for this weekend, with the winners set to face the Ulster champions in the All-Ireland semi-final. googletag.cmd.push Kerry beat Cork in the Munster final and Connacht pulled their decider forward to last Saturday, a game Roscommon defeated Sligo in, - to -. With the Republic of Ireland moving into level five in their latest lockdown to curb Covid-, it did place the championship in doubt. Reports emerged that Ulster were confident of the minor grade being grated the elite statusneeded to continue. Derry minors trained on Christmas eve morning in their preparation for their planned showdown with Tyrone, only to have their hopes dashed. At . that evening, Boyle received an email, relaying the postponement of their semi-final clash and had to pass the message on to the players, via WhatsApp. googletag.cmd.push “It was a bit of a gunk and, as usual, it was tough on the players,” Boyle told the County Derry Post yesterday. “The seniors have got through untouched and the minors have been pulled from pillar to post. It is tough on cubs and you have to remember, they are  or  years of age.” For now, county minor and U teams, preparing for their ious championship games, must train in pods of  players, with no contact allowed. Championship action is not expected to resume before January   at the earliest, the original date for the All-Ireland semi-finals and counties would likely get just days notice, leaving them going into action with an absence of contact training,     “They have no choice, everybody is in the same boat and it is no advantage to anybody. You just have to get on with it,” said Boyle, who also has a concern as how the fall-out will impinge on the  season. The  All-Ireland final cant be played until the first week of February at the earliest, the weekend earmarked for the official start date, under GAA rules, for collective training with  squads. Derry were due to start the trial process on Sunday for the next group of county minors, with the championship window due to begin on the weekend of March  . “I dont knowthe GAA will move theminor championship, considering what has happened. I just know it is going to be really tight,” said Boyle. “It leaves you very little time and when a cub gets a chance to represent their county at minor level, the least they should be afforded is a time-frame to give of their best when they put the jersey on. Thats not going to happen, so hopefully they will review the dates. “I can remember before Christmas, when we didnt know when it was going to happen, the chat was among the GAA thatit went on into February, they would pull it . “I just hope that chat doesnt . These boys, like all minors, for what they have been through, the least they deserve is for the championship to be completed, that would be my big thing.” If the level five restrictions are extended beyond the January  deadline, it could leave the GAA forced to consider using a Wednesday Sunday Wednesday schedule to squeeze the rest of the  championship into. Given the inclement weather conditions, Boyle said a condensed programme of games would be tough on players, but insists the current season must be finished. “The senior championship got played, which was great, but I just hope the minors arent dismissed asto say it is only minors. “With the sacrices they have made and responded to adversity, consistently, and I just hope the GAA bear that in mind and complete the championship to give them their day in the sun, as such. “You just hope and trust that the GAA will make the commitment to play the championship and it is completed, that the GAA respect the path these boys have been placed on for the last  or  months” The County Derry Post asked Ulster GAA for an update to last weeks decision to postpone the championship. A spokesperson gave the following response: “Under the new level  restrictions, inter county Minor games are no longer permitted from December th onwards. “Training at this level may continue but must be on a non-contact basis in pods of . Ulster GAA intends to complete these competitions at the first available opportunity.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Through World War , through The Troubles, through Derry City’s Irish League expulsion, greyhound racing has always survived from generation to generation and family to family. Ever since , greyhound racing has been a part of the Brandywell, and it became such a staple of local sport that it was even mentioned in Phil Coulter’s famous anthem – ‘The Town I Loved So Well’ – ‘While their men on the dole played a mothers role, fed the children and then trained the dogs.’ The sport is etched in the city’s history and today the Derry News looks back on the good old days with the men, women, boys and girls who played a part in the sport thriving on their doorsteps. googletag.cmd.push    Cormac McHugh from Stirling, Australia, retains a great fondness for the sport in Derry. “Derry Dog Track has been a massive part of the city for many decades now,” he said. “It has brought a great camaraderie amongst, men, women and children. I’ve had many great nights in Derry and started off some great greyhounds off in Derry. It is also home of the great FARLOE Line which is world-renowned.” Jeff De La Cruz, from Cardf, visited the Brandywell with his family to relive memories with his late father. “My late father enjoyed many a night at the Brandywell when he was serving in Derry in his National Service,” he said. We flew out in  and he loved going to the Brandywell again. He said it was lovely to see greyhound people from both sides of the community enjoying the racing, like it always was.” googletag.cmd.push Those are just a few of the tributes to a sport that remains important in the hearts and minds of countless families in the city and beyond.           --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The park occupies a large area behind the Creggan and Rosemount areas of the city. It is home to two reservoirs which are used for a range of water-based activities. However, local councillors believe there is great potential for the further development of the park and they have asked council officers to prepare a report on what can be done. This follows recent discussions over flood risks which have been identied at the Creggan reservoirs. The Derry News recently uncovered information which identied the local reservoirs as ‘high risk’. googletag.cmd.push A flood inundation map shows that in the event of reservoir failure, areas as far away as the Strand Road and Buncrana Road would be impacted. At present it is known that the flood risk associated with the reservoirs will affect developments at Fort George, a community centre and social housing in the Glen area, the A Buncrana Road, possible Magee expansion and Ardnashee School. In addition, private development at the former Arntz Belting site falls within the flood inundation zone. As a result of the flooding issues raised at Creggan Country Park, the local council has proposed the setting up of a management partnership at Creggan reservoirs. googletag.cmd.push The council recently agreed to liaise with central government departments to prepare a ‘detailed business case’ to seek the necessary capital and revenue finances. The council said it will also continue dialogue with Creggan Country Park Enterprises Ltdand explore the possibility of the council with CCPEL, taking on the joint role of Reservoir Manager. The issues with Creggan Country Park were again discussed at the councils recent monthly meeting. Speaking at the meeting, People Before Profit Councillor Shaun Harkin said that while talks were underway about the future of the Creggan park, he believed it was an opportunity to do more to make the best of the great potential of the park.     He said there were a lot of areas of the park which were not currently being utilised. Cllr Harkin proposed that the council look at creating a masterplan to develop the country park to its full potential for the benefit and enjoyment of people living nearby and within the wider council area. The proposal was supported unanimously by other councillors.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Writing in his new book, The Invisible Game, the two-time All-Ireland winning midfielder dedicated the battleground chapter to players he came up against in the midfield sectors on pitches across Ireland. Walsh highlighted nearly  players, which included Enda Muldoon and Anthony Tohill, before summing up to give his top three. Brian McGilligan, supported by Ger Lynch, in action against Andrew Jarmon of Australia during the  International Rules series in Croke Park  McGilligan, McGrane and McCreery were among those I admired most, and McGilligan was the best in my opinion. He had excellent footwork and was such a physical specimen. He churned it out consistently, doing the simple things right. He was courageous and consistent but most of all he was caring, Walsh said. googletag.cmd.push He brought it every day so that his teammates could get the limelight. Once Derry won, he didnt care who was getting the love from the terraces or the media, but he was the heartbeat of the team. The autobiography was written by Daragh O Conchuir.  googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Students save a considerable amount of time by using the laneway to get to and from school.The former Down Council attempted to secure funds to upgrade the laneway and carry out a much-needed resurfacing and lighting scheme but liaising with representatives from a number of statutory agencies including the Housing Executive and Roads Service, the ownership issue could not be firmly established.Describing the laneway as a ldquovital link for residents who live at the Langley Road area in particular, Cllr Walker hopes that, with the publicrsquos help, he can find out who owns the land.ldquoThere are several street lights along part of the laneway but the Department for Infrastructure insists that it is not responsible for the land, he said.Cllr Walker says it is necessary to find out who owns the laneway as work is starting to upgrade Ballynahinchrsquos masterplan which includes a number of new walking trails in and around the town.ldquoWhy not include Beedhamrsquos Lane in the planned trails andwe could find out who this piece of ground it could pave the way for its upgrade, he continued.ldquoPeople could be forgiven for thinking that it leads to a farm. Given that we are in the midst of winter, the laneway is an awful state and children who are walking to school are literally getting covered in mud.Cllr Walker has suggested that it would not cost a signicant sum of money to upgrade the laneway which he suggests has the potential to become a key component of the townrsquos planned new walking trails.ldquoIf anyone can help me identy who is responsible for this piece of land could they contact either myself, the Langley Road Residentsrsquo Association or Newry, Mourne and Down Council, he said.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe upgrade of this particular laneway has been raised on numerous occasions in the past, but nothing has ever been done.ldquoGiven the high volume of pedestrian traffic which uses it, itrsquos important work gets underway to upgrade it.ldquoIn seeking to find out who owns the laneway I hope that it can be determined of this particular piece of ground is a registered right of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Caldwell.jpg","title":"Caldwell’s goal seals cup win  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS U- hurlers will have cause to celebrate Christmas with a little more cheer after they clinched the Peadar Oacute Laithaacutein Cup with a two-point win over Meath in Navan on Sunday.Two minutes into injury time, and with the sides deadlocked at - apiece, it looked aswe were heading to extra time when Ryan Byas struck over a wonderful m sideline.Meath looked to have sealed victory from a doggedly tough Down side with virtually the last play of the contest.However, straight from the resulting puck-out Michael Dorrian raced clear of midfield and floated the sliotar towards the edge of the box.Francis Caldwell reached highest and as he slipped past both Cottrell and Ennis in defence.A deftly-placed one handed flick out-foxed Jack Fagan as he lunged out to intercept the sliotar. He could only watch on but as it bypassed his attempts and nestled in the back of the Meath net.Finn Turpin opened the day with the first score of the game inside a minute. Downrsquos captain, Tom McGrattan, knocked over a free a minute later, but by the end of the first quarter Meath were in front as midfielder Joey Cole got the next three scores.McGrattan levelled matters from play shortly afterwards, as both defences were kept busy.On several occasions in the first half, Down threatened the Meath rearguard as goal chances went begging with James Clarke, Michael Dorrian and Caldwell all having attempts saved, blocked or bundled away from danger.Down struggled in the middle of the park and found it hard to win any puck-outs against a physically strong Meath team.They did though throw themselves into every tackle. Jarlath McCollum, Deaglan Mallon and James Higgins played out of their skins, harrying, hustling and shutting down any potential danger as Meath tried in vain to breach the Down defence.A McGrattan free and a Caldwell point saw Down edge into a two-point lead in a very scrappy final ten minutes of the half.With less than three minutes to the whistle, Meath hit a purple patch with four unanswered scores, two courtesy of the dangerous Ryan Byas and the others from corner men Rory Fagan and Josh Harris.Playing with a slight breeze in the first half, Meath knew thatthey were to ensure a victory on home soil, they would surely need some daylight between themselves and their northern opponents before the change of ends.Thankfully for Down, Turpin, Dorrian and Clarke kept Meath on their toes as they eventually managed to engineer the last score of the half.Oisiacuten Coulter popped the sliotar over from out near the side-line to leave just two points between the sides at the end of the half.Within the opening two minutes of the restart, Oisiacuten Coulter continued a good vain of form and had the sides level for the fth time, as both sides refused to yield.Joey Cole pointed four minutes later as the Royals introduced Matthew Cully to full forward, his introduction would breathe new le into their attack.Down initially struggled to handle the burly full forward, who ended the day with three superbly-taken points whilst under severe pressure from their Ulster counterparts.The lead changed hands again as two McGrattan frees and a Michael Dorrian point gave them a slight edge with the game fast approaching the second water break.A Jack Meagher score, followed swtly by Matthew Cullyrsquos first of the day, when he picked Downrsquos pocket after a quick puck-out had failed to reach its intended target, shook Down. Instead of leading going down the home straight, it was level at - each.With  minutes played Denis Darby won a sideline for the home side and when Byas hit the sweetest of strikes straight over Pearse Smythrsquos crossbar there were scenes of jubilation and euphoria from the Meath bench as surely it looked asJustin Coyne would be presented with the cup.Sean Young had this young Down side well drilled and it was a credit to the teamrsquos spirit that within the next  seconds Downrsquos goal machine, Francis Caldwell ensured that it would be a victory for Down in the strangest of seasons five days before Christmas.After seeing Tom McGrattan lt the cup, a delighted Young was magnanimous in victory and praised Meath for the high standard of Hurling that made this contest such a thriller.ldquoWe knew coming into the game today this would be a very dferent challenge than last week, he said.ldquoMeath are always a big strong physical side with a spread of talented Hurlers in their ranks. We knew it wasnrsquot going to be easy to play them in their back yard, it was going to be a monumental task to get over the line.ldquoI thought the game was nip and tuck in the first quarter as our main objective was not to concede any early goals playing against a stf breeze in the first half. I canrsquot praise the boys enough, our bench helped us over the line and it was a superbly taken goal from Francis.Meath: J Fagan, R Ennis, H Cottrell, E Cole, P Connelly, J Coyne, K OrsquoGorman, J Cole , E Grehan, R Byas , J Meagher , S Donnelly, R Fagan , J Harris, S Cunningham .Subs: M Cullyfor Harris, E McCormack for Donnelly, D Darby for Cunningham.Down: P Smyth, J Higgins, D Mallon, J McCollum, N Kelly, C Savage, F McFall, R OrsquoNeill, J Duggan, F Turpin , T McGrattan , M Dorrian , O Coulter , J Clarke, F Caldwell .Subs: S Milliganfor OrsquoNeill, F MacManus for McGrattan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan woman’s releases debut children’s book  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman has joined the ranks of childrenrsquos book authors.Kathleen McPolin, who is a Speech and Language Therapy Assistant in Downpatrick SureStart, has just published the first in an exciting new series featuring the farm-based adventures of Boomer and Blanky.Produced by Shanway Press in Belfast, the books are aimed at encouraging early yearsrsquo interest in reading and promote new vocabulary.Part of Kathleenrsquos work with SureStart over the past  years has been helping to facilitate rhythm, rhyme, and story sessions each week for children - with their parents or s.ldquoBecause this age group have short attention spans, I find the books that really capture their attention are the colourful ones with few words but yet have a story to tell, explained Kathleen.After finding it dficult to get the right books to cover everyday topics such as transport, weather, clothes, and food in a short-story style, Kathleen decided to create her own.ldquoChildren love to see the same characters appear regularly in their books.

He had lived in London most of his le, leaving Saul at the age of .Engaged to be married, but struggling to find the right ring, he found himself back in Northern Ireland on business he decided to call on his uncle Will, his only surviving Irish relative.It was the eve of the longest night of the year, a few days before Christmas, and a bitterly cold late afternoon. On the side of a rural road, devoid of street lights, all but hidden by trees, was an old fashioned car, with smoke escaping from its engine.Standing beside the car, kicking it was a young woman in a bridal dress. She appeared to be beating up the motor. Jim applied the brakes of his vehicle and rolled down the window.lsquoCan I help rsquo The young woman looked at him with burning blue eyes, turned away and thumped the boot. lsquoUseless piece of junk,rsquo she shrieked. The young woman attempted to give the car one last kick, missed and ped with a thud on to her rear. Jim got out of his car. Trying not to laugh he rushed over to the young woman and attempted to help her to her feet.She pulled her arm away and with an effort dragged herself up using the carrsquos half open door. She ripped of her shoe and attacked the window screen. She turned to Jim. lsquoWhat do you know about fixing cars rsquo Jim shrugged.The bride pierced him with fiery blue eyes.lsquoAre you going to a fancy dress party rsquo he asked. lsquoI am going to be married,rsquo she replied. She banged the roof of the car with her shoe a number of times, hopping about attempting to put the shoe back on to her foot. lsquoLet me give you a lt,rsquo suggested Jim.In order to steady herself the bride hung on to Jimrsquos shoulder and finally won the battle of the shoe. lsquoThought yoursquod never ask.rsquo She lashed out at the motor with her fist, missed, spun around and fell into Jimrsquos arms.Saul Church was only a mile away. The lady could not walk to her own wedding, besides it was growing dark. She grabbed his coat in near panic. lsquoMy ring,rsquo she cried. lsquoIrsquove lost my engagement ring!rsquo She dropped on to her knees. lsquoThis is a nightmare and you are not helping.rsquoJim walked at speed to his car and grabbed a torch as the bride crawled around the ground, feeling the earth in a vain attempt to retrieve the ring. Jim ed and shone the torch about the trees and grass. She grabbed his leg and pointed towards her car.lsquoItrsquos cursed, the car is cursed, and so are you.rsquo She bit him on the knee. lsquoGet off me,rsquo he shouted. She sat back on a muddy mound. lsquoI may have overreacted,rsquo she said. lsquoIs my lipstick smudged rsquo She wiped her hand across her lips. rsquoI think it might be smudged.rsquoJim did not answer, choosing to rub his knee, shine the torch, find the ring and hightail it to his unclersquos house as fast as possible. lsquoItrsquos all go,rsquo she said, trying to make conversation. lsquoIf my father could see me now, he would be so proud.rsquo The young woman adjusted her veil. It slowly drooped on to the side of her head and from there drted towards her lap. She picked it up and tossed it away.Jim located the ring beside the front wheel. lsquoIrsquove got it, Irsquove got the ring.rsquo He retrieved it and gave it a amateur polish. It was silver with an small amber stone as its centre piece. He read the inion lsquoTo M.K, Saul rsquo. It must have been handed down through her intendedrsquos family.lsquoYou great big sexy man. The bride jumped to her feet. Well done.rsquo She kissed him on the nose. lsquoItrsquos a lovely ring,rsquo said an embarrassed Jim. lsquoI am engaged, havenrsquot got the ring yet.rsquoThe bride grabbed the ring and placed it on to her finger lsquoThen you had best get a move on, you donrsquot want to lose her.rsquo She took out a hanky and blew her nose with considerable force.Jim noticed in the torch light that she was muddy and dishevelled, her face and red hair littered with spots of mud.lsquoYou donrsquot have a driver rsquo he asked. lsquoSmelly little man, didnrsquot trust him, kicked him out a mile or so back,rsquo she replied. Jim had spotted a somewhat sad looking gentleman on the road a few minutes before. lsquoShall we go rsquo asked the bride, as she gathered up her dress and walked towards his car, tripping over her loose shoe, all the while muttering under her breath.They didnrsquot speak much during the short trip to the church lsquoYes, I am looking for a ring. Where did you get yours rsquo Jim inquired.                                                                    lsquoYou like it rsquo asked his odd passenger as she struggled in vain to apply lipstick. Jim smiled and nodded his head. The bride inspected her ring lsquoItrsquos very nice, expensive,rsquo she boasted. lsquoWas it handed down through your fianceacutersquos family rsquo The bride didnrsquot reply. lsquoI live in London, I am visiting my uncle Will, do you know him, Will OrsquoBrien rsquoJim noticed that the young lady was gazing out of the window, looking slightly lost, she was not in the mood for conversation. The car came to a halt outside the little church. Warm lights beamed from inside. Jim thought it was an odd time of day to get married and a strange time of year. A few indistinct people stood around the grounds of the church.The bride opened the door, lsquoIrsquom here,rsquo she said and fell out of the car, lsquoIrsquom alright,rsquo she said painfully, stood up and slipped. Steadying herself, she kicked his car and her shoe dropped off. She picked it up and without so much as a thank you, disappeared, muddy and wet, into the church, resembling a worn-out scarecrow more than a bride. Jim waited a moment before driving off.Uncle Will and Jim talked and joked as they caught up with all the news over tea and cake. lsquoDid you ever meet Maureen Walsh rsquo asked Uncle Will. Jim shook his head as he helped himself to an extra slice of cake.Your grandfather was meant to give her lt to her wedding. She and he didnrsquot hit it off.rsquoUncle Will poked the dying embers of the fire. lsquoHe wasnrsquot one for bathing,rsquo he mumbled under his breath.lsquoShe died a few hours ago.

It was slightly bizarre, as one was a track and field meet, and the other a cross country race.As most of us donrsquot know what day it is, let alone which month, this blending of two dferent seasons seemed acceptable to many.The ANI Winter Track Series, spread over two nights, included a range of distances with East Down ACrsquos Neil Curran opting to give the km a blast. He has mostly been training solo since March and was glad of the opportunity to mix with some speedy competitors.He raced well and was pleased with third place in his heat. He recorded a time of .. which is only five seconds off his PB for the distance and proves that he remains in good form, despite the lack of racing to keep him sharp.In  his attempts at this distance exceeded the  minute barrier so this represents commendable progress overall. Keep at it Neil.The first cross country event of the  autumn season was also the last of the year. The Bobby Rea Memorial had been scheduled and rescheduled as restrictions rose and fell, but finally got away on Sunday at the Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.There was a limit on the entries and waves were allocated to permit social distancing. Sadly there were no spectators allowed. East Down AC had only three runners taking part as the change of date had affected overall attendance.The first to test the underfoot conditions were the senior men with Aaron McGrady representing East Down.The race got underway after a short period of silence in honour of John McKeag, the Ballydrain Harriers stalwart who sadly passed away the previous Monday in his th year.Aaron had hoped to fit in this particular race as a marker for his form ahead of the Intermediate Championships scheduled for mid-January but now likely to face abandonment due to the lockdown proposed to be implemented for six weeks after Christmas.The race consisted of two laps of .km each, the shorter distance designed, like the ision of the runners, into waves of up to a maximum of  runners each, to prevent mass overtaking to comply with social distancing requirements.As only half of the over  entries turned up, it was necessary to use only two waves.Aaron was drawn in the first wave alongside the faster runners and though he prefers to start relatively slowly and then set out to catch those in front, he doubtedit would be possible on this occasion so he was well to the fore from the off and came through at the end of the first lap in fourth place.However he stuck with his pre-race plan and when the runners re-appeared at the end of lap two, he was in third place behind Mark McKinstryand Craig McMeechan , and comfortably maintained his position until the finish line.He said afterwards that he was happy with how the race had gone and had no regrets about his tactics. The first three recorded times were ., . and . respectively, which is pretty hot running on a cross country course that was holding a fair amount of overnight rain. Well done Aaron.The second race was for senior and masters women and East Down AC again had only one representative mdash the ever-enthusiastic Sharon Madine.Sharon started conservatively in the second of the two waves, but proceeded to make steady progress and at the end of her two laps she had a time of . against her name. When the results of both waves were combined she placed overall th but first in the over- category. Well worth the efforts Sharon.The third and final event of the day was for Male Masters and again a sole East Down AC runner mdash the evergreen Dee Murray. Another who seems to have lost none of his competitive edge during the pandemic, Dee simply turns up and runs as hard as he can.On Sunday this meant that his time of . gave him th place overall and second in the over- category. Well done Dee.In spite of the absence of spectators, all who turned up said that it was well organised and they were glad to have taken part. As one of the few interested official observers, I have to agree with that.Sandwiched between these two events was the East Down AC annual Xmas predicted K at the Downshire Estate on Thursday evening.This is a fun event where runners try to guess how long they will take to cover the distance and then without a watch or other timing device do their best to match it. With the emphasis on accuracy and pacing rather than speed the way is wide open for all to snatch the prize.The top five were impressively close to their predicted times with fth place going to Johnny Holmes, who was seven seconds out. Deirdre Weatherall and Colin Shields tied for third equal - each with a five-second deficit.Seamus Savage was four seconds off his guess, which was good going, but it would have been hard to beat the winner Maureen Kelly who was a mere one second to the better of her guess. She was delighted to top the table and over the moon to find that her prize was a hamper of goodies as well as a pound voucher for Bells Supervalu Crossgar. Congratulations Maureen.Even though the runners had to be split into waves and social distancing was enforced, it was the best that was on offer due to current circumstances and it was a good boost to club morale. Instead of charging the normal entry fee, members were asked to donate food items which have been duly delivered to the Fountain Foodbank in the town.All in all it was a successful night for all concerned and an uplting end to a less than inspiring .

The enthralling cup tie ended - after  minutes with the sides locked at - after extra-time at Hampden Park.Hazard, who was recently handed the number one jersey by Hoops boss Neil Lennon, made both his European and Scottish Premiership debuts and retained the starting jersey for Sundayrsquos final.The stopper mdash who has also forced his way into the Northern Ireland international squad mdash was delighted to play a major part in his sidersquos cup final victory.And while his current contract expires in the summer which allows him to negotiate with other clubs in January, should he favour a move away from Celtic Park, leaving the club he has supported since he was a boy is the last thing on his mind.Conor described Sundayrsquos cup final as ldquocrazy day for him and his family who watched the match at home.ldquoThree weeks ago, I would never have been able to picture what happened there on that pitch, he said moments after his penalty shoot-out heroics.ldquoI am just absolutely over the moon. Irsquove been a Celtic fan my whole le and to get this opportunity, well I am just delighted, he said.ldquoTo play for such a worldwide club, we know what the fans expect and how much they drive us towards winning. It is an honour to play for them. I want to fully focus on each match, playing week in, week out here at Celtic, and hopefully it will come together.Conor said the final was a ldquomomentous day for him and his family, explaining that his lsquophone hasnrsquot stopped ringing.Conor grew up in Downpatrick and developed his skills in the Celtic academy, travelling across to Scotland for games from a young age.ldquoThe club means everything to me, he said. ldquoWe used to get up at am to get on the boat to go to matches and we wouldnrsquot be home until three the next morning. Itrsquos something I always dreamed of growing up.Conor has spent several spells out on loan in recent years in order to build-up his first team experience, readying him for a career between the sticks for Celtic.He got his chance to impress against Lille and Kilmarnock r as Celticrsquos form hit a rocky patch, but being selected by Lennon for the win over Hearts at Hampden Park was a huge confidence boost.ldquoI have to thank all of the staff and the manager for putting trust in me, said Conor.ldquoIt was a huge honour in such a big game. Thankfully, I was able to repay that trust with the two penalty saves. I have put a lot of work in and gone on loan spells waiting for my chance. The coaches have helped me a lot throughout the club.Sundayrsquos cup win clinched the domestic treble for Celtic for the fourth successive campaign, something that has never before been achieved. It is also the th time Celtic have been crowned Scottish Cup winners, with the Downpatrick man admitting the team has a lot of work to do to try and achieve its aims and targets this year.ldquoThe final was only my third game for the club, so Irsquom taking each day as it comes. As a team and as a group, this win could be a major factor in turning things round, he added.Conorrsquos family watched his cup final heroics at home in Downpatrick as fans were not allowed to attend the match due to coronavirus restrictions. However, they were over the moon with his achievements.ldquoI donrsquot think I have any fingernails left after that, laughed his beaming dad Gary. ldquoWe didnrsquot know up until the last minutehe would get the nod to play or not. We knew he did well in the European game and certainly made a case for himself. He only found out on Thursday from Lennon that he would be playing.Whilst there was undoubted pride from his dad, Gary said Conor has deserved his break due to how hard he has worked.ldquoHe has put so much time into Celtic over the years and done all the right things. All the close family are so proud of him, his mum Pauline, his younger brother Jack. He was superb.ldquoConor very much wants to be able to go on and make himself number one for Celtic. He is only  and this was just his third appearance, so hersquos been doing well. He had a loan spell at Dundee and did very well there and that has put him in good stead.Gary said Conor has also been drawing high praise from his Northern Ireland manager Ian Barraclough after breaking through for the senior team too.ldquoBarraclough has spoken really highly of Conor. He did very well for him when he was the manager at under-age level and the boss knows what he can do in training, he said.Conorrsquos family are no strangers to sporting success either.

They will be hoping that he [the abuser] will be OK, she explained.ldquoI have seen over the years that women and children develop this radar with antennas scanning all the time to judge his mood, howrsquos he walking, howrsquos he eating, scanning constantly all the time, thinking is it safe, is he OK, are we annoying him  It will not matter as he is only one who can control his behaviour.While Eileen is keen to highlight that Womenrsquos Aid will provide   help to women, she also wants to dispel some myths about domestic abuse and violence and to talk about coercive control mdash any act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten victims.ldquoOne of the main things we do for women when they come into the service is to help her understand that there was not anything she did as therersquos nothing she could have done which would have stopped him, she said.ldquoWe have women who have had to beg to have a shower and we have women who phone us who are literally hiding in a hedge as hersquos walking up and down the street trying to find her.ldquoA lot of us think its black eyes and broken bones but the real damage is the psychological torture that is going on where women and children are terrorised in their own home. They are led to believe that everything is all their fault, they are at the root cause of whatever incident. When you are living with that  , you are only surviving.Womenrsquos Aid recently launched an awareness campaign called lsquoUnlock Your Lockdownrsquo to highlight their services to women who are living in fear or under threat.Eileen said: ldquoI would say that any woman who is worried at how she is going to get through Christmas andit is to do with her partner, then I would say to ring us and have a chat. We donrsquot force anybody into the service and we donrsquot make women leave home, thatrsquos always their choice.ldquoWhat we do is to work with her and help her to determine where she is and whatrsquos the best option for her. It can be either just one phone call to her engaging in full services for anything up to two years.She stressed that the first thing Womenrsquos Aid do when a women calls them is to assess the risk she and her children are in.ldquoThe first we do is assess the risk, to find out how safe she is, where she is, where her children are, what is the immediate priority  she stressed.ldquoDepending on the level of risk, we may had to do several dferent things. It could be that a woman is hiding out at a family member or friendrsquos house, so it might involve the police or social services.Then we try to manage the risk and reduce it as much as possible and then we try and work with out how best to help her move forward and to keep her safe. For the top % of women who come to us, we would hold a Multi-Agency Risk Assessmentconference and then we would work with them on a continuous basis.ldquoHowever, I would like to stress there is no such thing as low level risk of domestic abuse for women because the only person who is in control of whether that risk is high, low or medium is the perpetrator.She is dismissive of abusers where an incident of abuse involves either drink or drugs.ldquoIf you keep terrorising the people that you love and continually use the excuse of alcohol or drugs I donrsquot buy that, said Eileen.ldquoWhat drink and drugs to is give him an excuse for violence. When itrsquos over he will say it was the drink or whatever. But I always say to that isI woke up tomorrow morning to see my partner battered or bruised and he told me I had done it last night with drink in me, would I take a drink again  Yet these guys continue to do it.ldquoThere is no doubt about that we work with traumatised women and children and people try and deal with it in many dferent ways. Trauma basically makes the whole world unsafe for you and you donrsquot know where the next incident will come from.Support and information are available at www.womensaidni.org including information on the local centres covering all of Northern IrelandTo contact police, call the non-emergency lsquorsquo number or call lsquorsquo in an emergency.

So many businesses have been closed this year and at times itrsquos been like a ghost town. I think people have recognised the situation and reevaluated how they do things.ldquoI regularly get people who live here who think Irsquom new ndash and Irsquove been here  years. Then I realise they usually work away from Penarth from Monday to Friday and on Saturday they go to the supermarket ndash but thatrsquos changed recently.ldquoWhen people pop out for a sandwich theyrsquore staying in Penarth, and theyrsquore coming to see the Christmas window displays.Hamptons was one of the first in the town to don the Christmas tinsel, and Mr Knowles said this year it was important they ldquopushed the boat out.ldquoWhen we entered the firebreak we took the decision that people needed some sparkle, but we were also concerned of more restrictions before Christmas, he added.ldquoWe thought it made sense for everyone to bring Christmas forward.ldquoThen we had the luxury of being closed for two weeks to really focus and do as much decorating as we could.ldquoI think itrsquos important.

It probably means wersquove had more shoppers from further afield too.ldquoI am sure the offers and the campaigns have helped, and itrsquos that community spirit among traders which is a huge strength of ours. I hope the impact on peoplersquos shopping habits is long lasting.Mr Knowles praised traders societies Penarth Business Group and Shop Penarth for their efforts to get more people to the town.ldquoLots of towns donrsquot have what we have ndash a group of businesses that make a collective effort to back one another,\" he said. \"Itrsquos important we keep that going and donrsquot rest on our laurels.ldquoWe canrsquot think of it as though wersquove got the answer to a successful high street, because there will always be a need to reinvent.\"Perhaps itrsquos more of a first page in an exciting new chapter. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Primary schools in particular, there is no rationale to close them.\"We have to take in account the fact that evidence doesnrsquot show signicant harm we can reduce or avoid by closing them.\"What we do know is that it causes real harm to children and their prospects.\"It is also the direct impact on the mental health and wellbeing of children by closing schools.\"While first minister Mark Drakeford said: ldquoIf I thought that those young people would genuinely be at home, genuinely self-isolating, genuinely creating that period before Christmas to keep them safe, Id be attracted to the idea.\"Im afraid the risks are that that simply wouldnt happen, that those children would be doing riskier things than they would in school. Better for them to be in school.\"But there was pressure from teaching unions for a sht in position.The National Association of Headteachers Cymruwrote to the minister for education, Kirsty Williams, to call for the closure of schools ahead of the Christmas holiday.They said: ldquoParents will undoubtedly vote with their feet and children will be kept at home.\"That choice will not be afforded to school staffschool leaders are not supported in closing school sites.\"No direction from the government on this issue risks large numbers of families making their own decision to take children out of school and once again will result in a mixed economy across Wales, with local authorities making their own decisions based on local circumstances. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMike Kingston, who this week collected his long service medal to recognise the achievement, has shared his pride and some of his memories over the years.Mr Kingston, who is married and has two children and two grandchildren, joined Penarth RNLI on November  , as a volunteer crew member ndash and quickly progressed to become leboat helm.Along with his fellow volunteer crew members, he attended hundreds of incidents, launching day and night in all kinds of weather conditions, to go to the aid of people in trouble at sea.Since his retirement from being a sea-going member of the team, he has spent the last  years as shore crew and one of Penarthrsquos Deputy Launching Authorities, liaising with the coastguards when they request assistance, and managing the leboatrsquos launch.Mr Kingstonrsquos leboat career has extended beyond the UK. In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives. Irsquom proud to have been a part of Penarth RNLI family.Thanking him for his  years of service, Jason Dunlop, Penarth Leboat Operations Manager said: ldquoOn behalf of all at Penarth leboat station, I would like to congratulate Mike on this fantastic achievement and thank him for his commitment and support to saving lives at sea over the last  years. We are all volunteers at Penarth RNLI, we give our time freely to support our local community.ldquoMikersquos contribution to the charity over the years has not only been volunteering his time, hersquos also been happy to share his wealth of experience with the crew as we train and work together when someone needs our help.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local community\"The increasing numbers of Covid- case numbers across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan Health Board area could not be any more serious or alarming.Therefore, this message needs to be acted upon urgently and be seen as a warning to each and every one of us about the seriousness of the health situation we are all now facing.If current projections continue, then by Christmas week we will be seeing more than four times the number of new infections each day, than we were seeing at the start of December. These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Minister said: “My main priority has always been to protect our children’s education, mental health and well-being. I believe that this can best be achieved through face-to-face learning and social engagement in schools. “I am mindful of the impact the pandemic is having on our children and young people, particularly those who are vulnerable and from disadvantaged backgrounds. We have a high number of vulnerable children in Northern Ireland, for many of these pupils school is a safe haven and closing schools will immediately deprive them of this safe space. “That is why I have decided that it is in the best interests of all pupils for schools to open in the first week of January so that their education is not disrupted any further. “I want to again thank school leaders, teachers and staff who have done tremendous work, under very dficult circumstances, to keep schools safe. “I know that they will continue to reinforce departmental guidance, including the appropriate wearing of masks within schools and on school transport. “For my part, I will consider what further steps can be taken to help and support schools and will continue to seek the views of principals, school staff and pupils on this issue. “Finally, I want to wish principals, school staff, pupils and everyone who works in education a happy Christmas. The New Year will bring challenges but by continuing to work together we can get through this.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aaedbdfebf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ecbddbbeaa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1608539461488.jpg--christmas_bubbling_reduced_to_one_day.jpg?160853946100","title":"christmas bubbling reduced to one day ","story":"THE Executive has taken the decision to limit the arrangements for people to come together over Christmas.

A statement after the meeting readL The safest place for everyone to spend Christmas is in their own home and people are strongly advised to stay at home for Christmas.

As Christmas Day approaches, public health advice has been summarised into “Three Wise Moves”. The Minister said: We must remain vigilant about the threat from COVID-. The virus does not take time off. By strictly following public health advice, we can help reduce the risk to ourselves and others. “The emergence of a new strain of the virus has underlined the need to keep up our guard at all times. We underestimate this virus at our peril.” The Three Wise Moves are: Remember the basics. Keep contacts to a minimum. Keep your distance from others, wash your hands, wear a face covering. We’ve heard this advice countless times this year. But it’s just as relevant and just as important as it ever was. This is how we protect ourselves every day. Be risk aware. Particular settings are known to help COVID- spread: crowded places, close-contact settings especially where people have close conversations, confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. Remember over Christmas that social distancing can slip in familiar surroundings and familiar company. Watch out for old habits creeping back in. This cannot be a normal festive season. If in doubt, walk away. If any situation makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, remove yourself from it. Put safety first and err on the side of caution. That’s particularly important in the next few days ahead of the lockdown, when shops and hospitality will still be open. Just because we can do something, it doesn’t mean we have to. No set of regulations can cover every part of le or every activity. We all have to do our own risk assessments and make our own decisions on how best to keep each other safe.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aaedbdfebf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ecbddbbeaa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
