One protester wore a Colin Kaepernick shirt after the black American footballer who started the knee protest in the US. Thousands of demonstrators at times went down on one knee chanting \u0027George Floyd, George Floyd.\u0027It comes after UK chief constables joined forces to say they were \u0027appalled and horrified\u0027 by the death and called for \u0027justice and accountability\u0027, while warning those attending protests to do so while maintaining a safe distance.Separately, anti-racism campaign group Stand Up to Racism urged Britons to \u0027take the knee\u0027 on their doorsteps at 6pm tonight for a protest against discrimination which is also backing the Black Lives Matter movement.The protest in London, which come after days of intense protests and riots in America, took place as it was announced that all four of the officers involved in Mr Floyd\u0027s death have now been charged and face 40 years behind bars.   Thomas Lane, J.A. Kueng and Tou Thao were all present when Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd\u0027s neck in Minneapolis on Monday for eight minutes and 46 seconds.On Wednesday afternoon, the Minnesota AG charged the trio with aiding and abetting second degree murder which carries a maximum sentence of 40 years.Chauvin was originally charged with second degree murder which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years but he now faces 40 years behind bars too after being hit with an additional charge of second degree murder.The new charge also alleges that he intentionally killed Floyd, without premeditation, whereas the old charge suggested it was unintentional.The charges come after a week of global outrage and civil unrest across America during which millions called for the officers to be brought to justice.Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said at a press conference on Wednesday afternoon: \u0027I strongly believe these developments are in the interest of justice for Mr Floyd, his family, this community and this state.\u0027The Floyd family called the charges a \u0027bittersweet moment\u0027."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2044da140e84d0fbcda537c9453465806870d24/0_1622_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=012ecffc7183eeee95c1e3b5b48ee68b","title":"from gourmet takeaways to feeding a zoo how a scottish pub adapted to lockdown","story":"As the owner of East Lothian gastropub the Mercat Grill, Graham Blaikie has had to adapt his business to survive. Here, he tells Sophie Goddard how he’s keeping not only his pub afloat, but is helping out the people – and animals – around him, too ...For thousands of small business owners, the global pandemic has flung their futures – and those of their staff – into uncertainty. That’s certainly true for Graham Blaikie, and his pub the Mercat Grill in Whitecraig, Scotland. “I’d been watching the news about Covid-19 since December and luckily we’d prepared,” he explains. “Even before we closed, we had contactless hand sanitisers and I was always wiping down handles and menus. I’d also removed items from tables, so there weren’t as many touch points.” But when Boris Johnson’s March announcement saw pubs and restaurants close to the public, the business that had taken Blaikie nine years to build was suddenly forced to adapt for survival.The first step was ensuring customers could still enjoy the food they loved. “Prior to the shutdown, we’d been talking about what our strategy would be – I bought containers and had our takeaway menu prepped, so we were ahead of the game”, he says of being ready for business the next day. “We had a lot of fresh food in the pub, so on the Saturday we started the takeaway system.” But it wasn’t without its problems. “It’s not as easy as you think doing takeaway food, especially restaurant-style. When people order with us they’re having haggis cigars, patties, fish and chips, pepper beef with rice and my mum’s desserts ... that’s six different containers at least. We spent about £2,000 on takeaway boxes initially, that’s a lot of money. But it’s hopefully keeping us going.”With the government support package now in place – and extended until October – Blaikie has turned his attention to helping local people. Launching his Soup(er) Hero campaign in April, he is now making soup and sandwiches for those in need. With help from the community council, a community hub – where food is dropped off and distributed by local volunteers – was born. The feedback keeps him going. “There’s an older couple and the wife’s got cancer and every day they get their soup and sandwich,” he says. “They have the soup at 12 o’clock, then the man drives his wife to the hospital for her treatment and when they come back, they enjoy the sandwich. That’s what makes it worthwhile.”It’s not just people benefiting, either – residents of Edinburgh zoo are also tucking into the pub’s surplus wares. “I had a massive box of bananas left over and my mum said: ‘You should take this to the zoo.’ So I got hold of all my leftover fruit and knocked on the zoo door – and that’s been it ever since.” Now Blaikie’s weekly deliveries of fruit, vegetables and fish help to feed the animals at a time when visitors – the zoo’s main form of income – have come to a standstill. “You’d probably choose not to eat some of the bananas, for example, because they don’t look as good, but they’re perfectly fine for the animals. When we’re making sandwiches, not everybody likes the heels of the bread either, so I freeze them and take them along – nothing’s getting wasted. And if I see something for a good price at the wholesalers – apples, cabbages, broccoli - I’ll pick that up, too. We need to keep zoos going, they’re all under a lot of pressure.”While it’s difficult to ascertain when exactly businesses such as Blaikie’s will open again, for now, he is focusing on adapting the way they work to ensure business is possible. “We have an isolated table in the front vestibule area, so people can come in and collect food safely, using contactless on the card machines for takeaways. We have separate areas for drivers to sit in too, so we’re doing everything we can.” And plans are already afoot for when pubs are finally allowed to reopen. “I’m looking at adding an area to the outside, so people can sit there the whole year round and I’m hoping to put in a little microbrewerydistillery, so I could eventually make hand sanitiser further down the line.”Why focus on helping others when keeping his own business afloat requires such effort? “I believe in helping people. I know this virus is a horrible thing, but it’s bringing out a lot of good in people as well. Neighbours are looking after neighbours, people are helping others with shopping or taking dogs for a walk. For so long, I didn’t like the way the world was going ...”What does Blaikie hope will come out of this situation? He pauses, then says: “That people start to work together a bit more, being more thoughtful of what’s going on around them. And of course, that they come to the Mercat for a meal.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

But thanks to safety measures put in place, a branch of David Abrahamovitch’s coffee chain is welcoming back happy customers and staffFor David Abrahamovitch, founder of cult coffee brand Grind, the decision to close his London-based food, coffee and cocktail bars was a painful one – and the decision to reopen one branch as a takeaway outlet on 20 May took even more careful planning.Abrahamovitch’s business journey started in 2011, when he inherited his father’s company. “I was 25 when I sadly lost my dad and inherited the family’s mobile phone business,” he says. “I had to decide what to do next – are we going to continue, are we going to close? I’d spent a lot of time in the shop as a teenager, helping out behind the counter, so it was very sentimental for me. I decided I wanted to keep the building and turn it into some kind of meeting place.”Converting the Old Street premises into a coffee shop, Abrahamovitch set about growing his business based on the cafes he’d visited on his travels. “I’d seen the independent cafe scene in other countries, and back then it just didn’t feel like it had been fully translated to the UK,” he says.“I wanted to recreate that Australian-style flat-white culture, with high-quality coffee beans, the best equipment, and amazing baristas who serve cups of coffee somewhere fun, lively and energetic. And I wanted to mix that with what the coffee chains do so well: good hygiene, mobile ordering and payment options and, most importantly, speedy service. A year later, we added cocktails when we realised our coffee made amazing espresso martinis!”Over the next nine years Abrahamovitch rolled his business out, spreading to 11 locations with 300 members of staff, serving sit-down breakfasts, lunch and dinner alongside coffee and cocktails. Grind also has an online business selling compostable coffee pods in refillable tins.When coronavirus reached the UK, Abrahamovitch’s business was sent into turmoil. “I’ve lived and bled this company for almost 10 years, and built it piece by piece, so finally getting to the point where we have tens of thousands of customers each week, then suddenly having to close was awful,” he says. “I remember the week of lockdown vividly. For a couple of weeks beforehand, we’d already seen sales start to fall away. We monitor sales to the hour, so when things start to drop off, you really notice it.“Then, when Boris Johnson told people they shouldn’t visit restaurants and bars, it was clear to us it was time to close. We shut all our stores, keeping just three open for takeaway to serve the local community for a few more days. When full lockdown was announced, we decided to close completely to protect our staff.”In the weeks since lockdown began, significantly more has been learned about the spread of Covid-19, and on 10 May the government announced certain businesses could reopen, with stringent safety rules in place. Guidance on how bosses can protect their workers, and how staff can safely travel into work, was drawn up. So now, companies such as Grind are taking tentative steps towards getting back to business, and on 20 May, its Greenwich outlet reopened its doors for grab-and-go coffees.Since plans to reopen were made, the safety of both staff and customers has been paramount. Grind works with a food hygiene company that has helped Abrahamovitch stay on top of the new government guidelines on safety and hygiene. “I think we’re all in a testing phase and figuring this out at the moment, but we’ve taken the steps we think are sensible without filling the place with yellow tape,” he says.“Only a couple of people are allowed inside the shop at any one time. Staff wear gloves, and at the tills there are big plastic screens separating them from customers – we haven’t made the wearing of masks mandatory, but they’re available if staff would like to use one.“We also have signs in the windows asking people to observe social distancing, stickers on the floor indicating what a two-metre gap looks like, and a hand sanitising station. It’s slightly odd having these things everywhere, but it seems to be working so far. I think people have got used to that kind of process in the last few weeks.”As well as coffee, the store is selling fresh bread, eggs and avocados, in lieu of breakfast. “We weren’t selling those things before, but we have great suppliers who make amazing bread and send us amazing eggs,” he says. “If we can help them and sell a few more products ourselves too, it makes sense. When you’ve suddenly got a daily bread delivery, it feels like you’re getting the wheels turning again.”Abrahamovitch took the inidual needs of his staff into careful consideration, making decisions based on the government’s advice, along with his own sense of duty to worried workers. On reopening Greenwich Grind, he took the simple step of asking which of his staff would be keen to return to work.“Everyone who wanted to be furloughed has been furloughed,” he says. “We haven’t laid anyone off as a result of this crisis, which helps me sleep better at night. Of those who volunteered to come back to Greenwich Grind, we selected those who live very close to the store, so there’s no need for them to get public transport into work. Lots of our staff walk or cycle in anyway, so if someone wants to come back, and lives close to a store we’re reopening, that’s a good fit.”Abrahamovitch hopes these measures will prove successful, and will lay the foundations for further, tentative reopenings. “We’re certainly expecting to learn a lot from this reopening,” he says. “At a lot of our sites, social distancing isn’t actually the biggest issue – for example, our London Bridge site relies on customers who work in the offices in the area, and the tourists who come to visit Borough Market at the weekend. Until they’re back, it’s going to be hard for us to reopen, but I hope to reopen one or two more branches in the next couple of weeks.”Abrahamovitch’s customers and staff are especially pleased by this step on the way to resuming business. “One of my staff texted me on the first day of reopening and said: ‘I’m so happy to be back and not just sitting in my living room. It’s been amazing.’ So that was pretty nice,” he says. “Our customers are thrilled, too – I was there the day before we opened, checking the safety measures for myself, and people were knocking on the door hoping to get inside early.“For me, as a customer, every time a place reopens I’m really happy. I think: ‘Great, I’ve got somewhere else to go, different people to meet, some different walls to look at.’ It’s definitely the same for our customers. They’re very pleased to have us back.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Six months later, I was shocked to learn he had passed’The next day, the guys arrived for the shoot laughing. Kurt was in sunglasses, with a sweater all buttoned up. When he took it off, it turned out he was wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words: “Corporate Magazines Still Suck.” Thankfully, Rolling Stone saw the humour in it and ran it on the cover.\u0026nbspThis photo came about in October 1993, when the band were touring the US after the release of the album In Utero. Kurt remembered our previous shoot, and I think he was grateful that we hadn’t tried to interfere. The shoot took place in Kalamazoo, Michigan. It was pretty smooth sailing, I think because we already had that bond.\u0026nbspMy sister helped me to order the dolls’ heads from New York, and we arranged them on an altar with rose bushes I’d picked up from a florist and left to wilt. The image was intended to be surreal – more of a still life than a portrait – but Kurt got it, and the band were really enthusiastic about the concept.\u0026nbspI tried variations with the whole band, but nothing worked quite so well as Kurt alone. There was something about him that pulled the image together. There was such intensity in his eyes and beauty in his face – even with the wear and tear of the road and the physical pain he had gone through.Great photography is not about lighting or technical stuff: it’s about how to engage your subjects. Having your picture taken isn’t necessarily easy, and in many ways it’s very unnatural to sit in front of the camera. But you need your subject to trust you in what is, frankly, quite a weird experience. That connection is essential to your work.He was quiet, but things seemed to be going pretty darn well for him at the time. He had his daughter with him, and the tour was in full force. I was in total shock when I heard the news six months later that he had passed. I couldn’t get my head around it. But I don’t think this image needs to be seen with a sense of foreboding. If anything, there’s something life-affirming about where he’s at, even if the framing is grotesque. It’s overwhelmingly about the beauty of him as a man. I only photographed him twice, but I always found him generous and gentle.Shooting Nirvana taught me that sometimes it’s better to allow the artist to direct where it’s going to go. It doesn’t have to be the photographer. And I think it distilled what this work is about for me: trying to interpret as closely as I can who my subject is, while at the same time staying loyal to my point of view. Marrying those two things is always the starting point.\u0026nbspNirvana changed modern music. Those transitions don’t happen very often. They were as important as any musicians in the last century. Even now, when I have a conversation with a young person who wasn’t alive during their years of stardom, they will know Nirvana and the various images of them. It’s like the Stones, the Beatles, or Elvis Presley – they’re milestones in culture.• This shot is on sale as part of an online auction in aid of charities combatting Covid-19 (bids close on 12 June), organised by Christie’s, RAD (Red Carpet Advocacy) and Mark Seliger Studio.\u0026nbspTrained: Houston’s High School for Performing and Visual Arts and East Texas State UniversityInfluences: “My 10th-grade teacher Don Lawson and my portrait and documentary teacher James Newberry.”High point: “Making my first book, When They Came to Take My Father: Voices of the Holocaust, on a subject matter that was personal and unedited.”Low point: “As far as I know I haven’t had any – but I’m open to suggestions.”Top tip: “There is no room in the middle and plenty of room on the top.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3283e73cef024b7011da78d627e266acd8add250/0_262_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc9d397133bfd98741a75962b032e3b9","title":"greta portrait of humanity 2020 shortlist in pictures","story":"A jockey in Belgrade, a barber in Havana, a famous young eco-warrior in Quebec ... the Portrait of Humanity prize captures the many vibrant faces of humanity around the world.

There will be smaller cuts at Rotherham, Washington, Denby, Bristol, Ansty near Coventry and London Heathrow.The Rolls-Royce chief executive, Warren East, suggested last month that about two-thirds of the 9,000 job cuts would fall in the UK, with another 3,000 redundancies expected in 2021.Before the job cuts were announced, Rolls-Royce employed 52,000 staff globally. As well as making and servicing commercial jet engines, it also makes fighter jet and ship engines in addition to reactors for nuclear submarines. However, it said there would be no job losses at its defence business.A Rolls-Royce spokeswoman said: “Offering voluntary severance is an important step as we resize our business to adapt to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the aviation industry.”She added: “We will unfortunately lose people who have worked hard to establish our world-leading position.”The Unite union’s national officer for the aerospace sector, Rhys McCarthy, said: “Today’s announcement by Rolls-Royce is another warning sign that the UK is in serious danger of losing its leading position in aerospace, in addition to losing thousands of skilled jobs.”The union also called for the UK government to give investment at levels “last seen in the postwar period” with a focus on new, environmentally friendly technologies.Rolls-Royce and Airbus have already cancelled their EFan-X programme to develop electric-powered aircraft.\u0026nbspMcCarthy said: “The UK needs to develop a survival and recovery strategy that includes an aircraft scrappage scheme so that more environmentally friendly aircraft, wings and engines that the UK produces can be brought into service by airlines.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21b7a30328150a0333317896cf2672f4aad25f9f/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=871ad9fb441bf347f79ff323e380131c","title":"indias reliance conglomerate raises 7bn in rights issue","story":"Sprawling company of Asia’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, claims world’s biggest non-bank fundraising in a decadeIndia’s telecom-to-oil conglomerate Reliance Industries has completed a massive $7bn rights issue in what it touted as the world’s biggest by a non-financial institution in a decade.Reliance, owned by Asia’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, had said the fundraising drive was meant to pay down debt and help shift the company to a digital future.The firm said in a statement late on Wednesday the rights issue was subscribed 1.59 times and attracted “huge investor interest”.The successful rights issue was a “vote of confidence, by both domestic investors, foreign investors and small retail shareholders, in the intrinsic strength of the Indian economy”, Ambani said in a statement.In April, Facebook took a $5.7bn stake in the Mumbai-based firm’s Jio digital platforms in one of India’s biggest foreign investments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47ff4b289e0db89728f7f73f5c2ac705fbfb3237/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0beb82b0408b03009155bdc2ce37cc9","title":"covid 19 uk car sales aston martin lookers ecb christine lagarde interest rate sterling dollar euro business live","story":"Live coverage as Aston Martin and car dealer Lookers announce costs savings plansAnother interesting detail from the SMMT data: Tesla’s Model 3 was the most popular car during May.That is mainly because Tesla does not rely on car showrooms to anywhere near the extent of traditional car manufacturers. However, it also illustrates the progress being made by battery electric cars, which have continued to grow strongly even during the pandemic.However, battery sales still only account for 1 in every 25 car purchases in the UK. The UK car market has halved compared to last year as the coronavirus crisis hits, with just over half a million registrations in the first five months compared with more than one million at this point last year. Some 20,247 cars were registered in the month, as “click and collect” services, allowed from mid-month, saw some movement in the market, the trade body said.That was an improvement from the 4,321 sold in April, but still 163,477 fewer than in the same month last year.Battery electric vehicles were the only segment in which sales improved - albeit from a low base - with 429 more units registered year-on-year as pre-orders of the latest premium models were delivered to customers. After a second month of shutdown and the inevitable yet devastating impact on the market, this week’s re-opening of dealerships is a pivotal moment for the entire industry and the thousands of people whose jobs depend on it. Customers keen to trade up into the latest, cutting-edge new cars are now able to return to showrooms and early reports suggest there is good business given the circumstances, although it is far too early to tell how demand will pan out over the coming weeks and months. Restarting this market is a crucial first step in driving the recovery of Britain’s critical car manufacturers and supply chain, and to supporting the wider economy. Ensuring people have the confidence to invest in the latest vehicles will not only help them get on the move safely, but these new models will also help address some of the environmental challenges the UK faces in the long term.Just when you thought you were out, Brexit drags you back in - that seems to be the view of foreign exchange analysts on the future prospects for sterling, which is under pressure this morning.Even as economists weigh economic prospects, there is very little time left for the UK to agree a wide-ranging free-trade agreement with the EU, extend the transition deal before the June deadline, or come up with a compromise of some sort. That is weighing on the pound.This is from the report by the perfectly named Jonathan Cable, from Reuters:“The fading prospect of an extension to the post-Brexit transition period, and the risk of supply chain disruption at the start of 2021, casts a cloud over (Britain’s) GBP outlook,” said James Smith at ING. “Brexit is back in the spotlight. There’s little to suggest we should expect any real progress, and that’s one reason why we’ve seen some risk premium creep back into the pound.” The pound is expected to have weakened to $1.23 by end-June, according to the wider poll of over 50 foreign strategists taken this week. Car dealer Lookers, which today announced plans for 1,500 job cuts, was in trouble well before the pandemic struck, with a fraud investigation and plans to close dealerships. The Covid-19 crisis has hurt it further.It will close 12 dealerships as it returns to selling and servicing vehicles after the coronavirus shutdown, writes the ’s Joanna Partridge.The group, which operates 164 car dealerships, says the latest redundancies are needed to protect the long-term future of the business and it hopes to save £50m a year from the job cuts.You can read the full report here:The FTSE 100 is on track for its first decline this week. It had been buoyed earlier in the week by optimism that the world economy will recover from the pandemic faster than previously thought.Good morning, and welcome to our live, rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets.Every aspect of the car industry has been hit hard by the pandemic, with showrooms lying idle for weeks (until Monday in England) and factories shutting their gates because of health fears and parts shortages. The latest updates show that the pain is only starting to be felt in the UK. Preliminary figures (ahead of the final release at 9am) showed that around 20,000 new cars were registered last month, up from just 4,321 in April but just a fraction of the 183,724 sold in May 2019. The weak sales show why the industry is pulling back, with two major rounds of job cuts announced this morning.Aston Martin has said 500 workers will lose their jobs, the embattled sportscar manufacturer said, as it seeks to cut costs under new chief executive Tobias Moers.The cuts reflect “lower than originally planned production volumes and improved productivity across the business”, the company said.

Black people know we need to dismantle the same system herePay attention to African Americans.\u0026nbspThe headlines are now describing the US as a nation in crisis. As the protests against the killing of African American George Floyd by a white police officer enter their second week – curfews in more than 40 cities, the deployment of the national guard in 15 states – there is a far deeper, more important message.\u0026nbspBecause the US is not, if we are honest, “in crisis”. That suggests something broken, unable to function as planned. What black people are experiencing the world over is a system that finds their bodies expendable, by design.\u0026nbspAfrican Americans told us this when they lost Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner, Chinedu Okobi, Michael Brown, Aiyana Jones, Tamir Rice, Jordan Davis, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, and so many more.African Americans told us this during the civil rights movement, the last time the US knew protests on this scale. And if the world paid attention to black people, then it would know that this state of terror extends far beyond the US. The Ghanaian president, Nana Akufo-Addo, captured the trauma of so many Africans around the world when he said that black people everywhere were “shocked and distraught”.In Australia, protesters relived the death of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Indigenous Australian man who died while being restrained by five guards in 2015. He also cried the haunting phrase, “I can’t breathe.” Meanwhile, just this week, a police commissioner in Sydney said that an officer filmed casually attacking an Indigenous teenager with brutal violence had “had a bad day.”\u0026nbspIn the UK, black people and our allies are taking to the streets as I write to wake British people up out of their fantasy that this crisis of race is a problem that is both uniquely American, and solvable by people returning to the status quo.The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on behalf of Britain: “We want to see de-escalation of all of those tensions.”\u0026nbspIf he had bothered to listen to black British people, he might have discovered that many of us do not want de-escalation. We want protest, we want change, and we know it is something for which we must fight. Because many of us have been fighting for this all our lives.\u0026nbspThe British government could have had the humility to use this moment to acknowledge Britain’s experiences. It could have discussed how Britain helped invent anti-black racism, how today’s US traces its racist heritage to British colonies in America, and how it was Britain that industrialised black enslavement in the Caribbean, initiated systems of apartheid all over the African continent, using the appropriation of black land, resources and labour to fight both world wars and using it again to reconstruct the peace.\u0026nbspAnd how, today, black people in Britain are still being dehumanised by the media, disproportionately imprisoned and dying in police custody, and now also dying disproportionately of Covid-19.\u0026nbspWhat the British government did instead is remarkable.\u0026nbspFirst, it emerged that it may have used George Floyd’s death as an excuse to delay a report into the disparity in ethnic minority deaths from Covid-19. Although the Department of Health officially denies it, there were reports that the Public Health England review\u0026nbspwas delayed because of concerns in Whitehall about the “close proximity to the current situation in America”.\u0026nbspThe government needn’t have worried, because instead of meeting the grief in our communities at so many deaths from Covid-19, its review fails to offer any new insight anyway.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt has now emerged that a key section, containing information on the potential role of discrimination, was removed before publication.\u0026nbspThe government’s response has been to appoint Kemi Badenoch, the minister for equalities, and a black woman, to “get to the bottom” of the problem.\u0026nbspWhat do we know about Badenoch’s approach to racism in Britain? On “institutional racism” – a phenomenon that affects minorities in Britain – she has been reported as saying that she doesn’t recognise it .\u0026nbspOn former mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith’s Islamophobic campaign? She helped run it. On the black community? She doesn’t believe that it really exists.On American racism? “We don’t have all the horrible stuff that’s happened in America here,” Badenoch said in 2017. \u0026nbspFor those of us who see racism for what it is, as a system that kills – both our bodies, and our humanity – this is traumatic. I listened to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, announce – as if it was his new discovery – that “black lives matter”, and offer someone as seemingly uninterested in anti-racism as Badenoch as a solution.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, that “horrible stuff that’s happened in America”?\u0026nbspOur reaction to George Floyd’s death as black British people is our expression of generations of lifelong, profound, unravelling pain. Some of us are speaking about this for the first time, in too many cases that I’m personally aware of, attracting reprimands and sanctions at work.\u0026nbspMy own personal protest has been silence.\u0026nbspNot silence at those protesting, with whom I am in full solidarity, and to whom I offer my support, my labour, my platform, my time and my resources. But a refusal to participate in the broadcast media, which – when racism becomes, for a few short days, a relevant part of the news cycle – call me in their dozens inviting me to painstakingly explain how systems of race are constructed.This time I’m watching other black people graciously, brilliantly, appear on these platforms to educate hosts and viewers alike.\u0026nbspAnd I know next time they will be asked to come again and repeat the same wisdom.\u0026nbspWe do this work all the time. We have taken what we inherited and had no choice but to make sense of it. We have studied, read, written and understood the destructive power of race. And we are telling you that race is a system that Britain built here.We are also telling you that as long as you send all children out into the world to be actively educated into racism, taught a white supremacist version of history, literature and art, then you are setting up a future generation to perpetuate the same violence on which that system of power depends.\u0026nbspWe are telling you that we need to dismantle, not to de-escalate.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6358913b8f70f64db6fa3f7f735a173c935bcb3a/0_42_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a63d51e6a6a2c2a535b684ad5592ce4","title":"covid 19 internet universal right lockdown online","story":"The internet eased lockdown life for millions. But millions more still can’t get online, and that’s fundamentally unfairMy 100-zip black backpack, previously the logistical and geek centre of my life, now sits neglected in a corner, not needed since Covid-19 abruptly halted my near-constant travel schedule.Life went on – with limited disruption, if not quite as normal. After all, I have enough space, equipment and internet connectivity to work comfortably from home. In some ways, life has become more efficient. Less jet lag. More sanity.I’m hardly alone in experiencing this. Those of us fortunate to have jobs we can do from home have tidied up our video conference backdrops and changed how we operate. Where they can, many children have adapted, more or less, to virtual classrooms and the need to compete for workspace with their parents.We keep in touch with loved ones via computer screens in ways we couldn’t have imagined only three months ago, while the crisis has spawned myriad coping mechanisms – from a boom in online quizzes, art classes and workouts to a golden age for memes.And while many of us are cooped up indoors, we have seen examples of great collective endeavour and support: communities coming together to help each other and the most vulnerable, albeit keeping two metres apart.In all of these things, the web has been the critical unifying force, enabling work, school, social activity and mutual support. Always intended as a platform for creativity and collaboration at a distance, it is great to see it also being used more than ever for compassion at a distance too. This is all very well, of course, if we have the web at our fingertips. But we are the lucky ones. Billions of people don’t have the option to turn to the web in times of need or normality. A gross digital ide holds back almost half the planet when it most needs the web.The challenge extends to the wealthiest nations, too: 60,000 children in the UK have no internet at home and device poverty stops many more from learning online while schools remain closed.In the US, an estimated 12 million children live in homes without broadband connectivity, and people are parking cars outside schools and cafes, desperate for a connection good enough to learn and work “from home”. These inequalities fall along the familiar lines of wealth, race and rural v urban ides.Working from home isn’t an option for many — including some who have jobs that could be done remotely. Businesses in areas without the infrastructure to trade online are denied a lifeline that is keeping others around the world afloat.\u0026nbspThe Alliance for Affordable Internet, an initiative of the World Wide Web Foundation, which was the foundation that I co-founded with Rosemary Leith, has outlined urgent actions that governments and companies should take to provide this lifeline to more people as quickly as possible.We’re in a world where it is so much harder to get by without the web. And yet the digital ide won’t disappear once this crisis is over. The ever-quickening march to digitisation has become a sprint. We must make sure those currently in the slow lane have the means to catch up. Otherwise billions will be left behind in the dust. As Covid-19 forces huge change to our lives, we have an opportunity for big, bold action that recognises that, as with electricity in the last century and postal services before that, the web is an essential utility that governments and business should combine to deliver as a basic right.History shows us that after all great global upheavals there are major attempts to repair the damage and rebuild, with some more successfully delivered than others. In the midst of this turmoil we must surely strive to ensure some good emerges out of the darkness.The web can and must be for everyone — now is our moment to make this happen. We have the technical means to connect the entire world in meaningful and affordable ways: we now need the will and the investment.Governments must lead the way. They must invest in network infrastructure, not only in urban centres, but in rural settings where market forces alone fail to connect residents. And because data affordability remains one of the biggest barriers to access, these networks must be efficient. For example, policies that encourage service providers to share network infrastructure, and regulations designed to shape competitive markets for data, can go a long way towards bringing down costs for users.\u0026nbspAnd, to connect everyone, governments will need to target typically excluded groups – including people on low incomes, women, and those in rural areas. This means funding public access and digital literacy initiatives to ensure everyone has the skills to use the internet in meaningful ways.Service providers must invest in network performance, reliability and coverage so that everyone is within reach of high-quality connectivity. We have seen experiments with drones, balloons and satellites to connect hard-to-reach areas. While these don’t replace good policy and investment in proven technologies, innovation such as this is a welcome addition to the mix.There is nothing to stop governments and companies making a choice now, to accelerate progress on connectivity where good changes are happening and to step up where they aren’t.Finally, we can all play a role as iniduals. If you’ve relied on the web recently, don’t you owe it to the other half of the world to help them get that lifeline, too?Demand action from your government to make universal internet connectivity a priority. Support a technology NGO such as the World Wide Web Foundation. Back the Contract for the Web — a collaborative project to build a better web, with universal connectivity as a key priority.Just as people campaign for clean water and access to education, we need a global campaign for universal internet access.We must, of course, be more alert than ever to the web’s shortfalls – the privacy violations, the misinformation and the online gender-based violence that has become far too familiar. But these very real problems must not deter us from achieving the foundational challenge of making the web available to all.Just as the world decided that electricity and water were basic needs that should reach everyone, no matter the cost, we should recognise that now is our moment to fight for the web as a basic right. Let’s be the generation that delivers universal internet access."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f16b797f659e09bf9673db64778cc459b5bcf539/305_0_5455_3273/master/5455.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e2d1bcdee8df426b3f713ec5a641e57","title":"how coronavirus could bridge generational divides not widen them","story":"Rather than pitting old people against the young, now is the time to unite against a system that only benefits those who are wealthyDuring the first weeks of the coronavirus lockdown in the United States and Britain, a flurry of media commentary centred around issues of generational difference in response to the pandemic. “Boomer” parents, although at heightened risk of deadly complications from contracting Covid-19, were apparently not taking the virus seriously enough. They flouted social distancing measures in favour of bridge games and cruise trips. The young, it seemed, were the adults in the room, begging for seriousness from their at-risk elders.\u0026nbspFor the most part, these stories were media trend pieces and glossed anecdotes drenched in unspoken class assumptions. These reckless parents in their 60s and 70s had accrued enough capital to be cruise-tripping and golfing they owned the homes where they should have been sheltering. And, as it turns out, the narrative of “unserious boomers” and “cautious millennials” obscured more than it revealed. The New York Times reported that a higher percentage of Americans born between 1946 and 1964 were practising social distancing than people born after 1980. Not to mention that many thousands of older essential workers, from nurses to supermarket workers, were left out of this tale of generational difference and indifference.There’s an understandable appetite for generational analysis during this pandemic. The risk of dying from the virus is primarily determined along age lines, while most workers under 40, already shut out of capital ownership, face mass unemployment and an economic depression with little financial insulation. Yet the story of medically imperilled boomers and economically imperilled millennials, while largely valid, ignores the cross-generational isions of class and racialised inequality this pandemic has exposed and exacerbated.\u0026nbspWe can argue about whether younger or older generations will suffer more and in what ways. Or we can recognise that our economic and political reality, forged in the service of capital, is incompatible with human flourishing for all but the wealthy. This reckoning need not pit the old against the young, but it will require a long overdue undressing of the economic ideology that defined the baby boomer generation and its legacy.Namely, that with a decent enough education, and by obtaining the necessary skills to produce value for a boss, you were ensured a materially secure future. This was already a boomer myth in pandemic times, it’s a cruel joke. Intergenerational solidarity during this crisis requires challenging the very value system that defined boomers and millennials as meaningfully distinct generations in the first place.\u0026nbspIn his 2017 book, Kids These Days: Human Capital and The Making of Millennials, the author Malcolm Harris defines millennials according to the material conditions that have defined the post-1980s decades in which they came of age. That is, a world where we were taught to accrue, indeed to become, “human capital”, turning ourselves into walking investments in our future capacity to earn and produce value. While wages have stagnated in recent decades, even some of the most privileged young people have taken on unprecedented amounts of student debt to chase the promise of a sustainable future available to a vanishingly small number of people.\u0026nbspThese conditions apply as much to millennials as they do to members of so-called Generation Z. While the affective experiences of current teenagers differ to those of early millennials, we’re in the same boat when it comes to the imperative of becoming human capital. “As it turns out,” wrote Harris, “just because you can produce an unprecedented amount of value doesn’t necessarily mean you can feed yourself under twenty-first-century American capitalism.”\u0026nbspThis should not be surprising: that capitalism depends on human life as exploitable labour is a feature, not a bug. The boomer experience of postwar wealth and full employment on a living wage was the exception to this rule. The pandemic and its attendant economic crisis are now exposing the horrifying stakes involved when life is reconfigured wholly in market terms. In late May, White House adviser Kevin Hassett cheerfully told CNN, “Our human capital stock is ready to go back to work.” Everyone from 40-year-olds to teenagers were sold a promise that we were to accrue “human capital” as an investment on returns for our own futures. But that promise was a myth. The capital was never ours. As Harris told me, in response to Hassett’s comment, “That’s giving away the game right there, admitting that human capital is something for capitalists and states to control and exploit, not a ‘company of the self’ that each worker has, which is what they’ve been telling us it is for years.”“Human capital stock” refers to the workers across generations who are being pushed back to work during a health crisis in order to produce more value for asset holders. It’s a dystopian scenario that offers up poor, older workers – especially workers of colour – as a blood sacrifice as readily as any millennial or younger slice of “human capital”.To be sure: it does not need to be this way. American billionaires have grown $434bn richer since the beginning of the pandemic. There are more than enough resources to go around. But the exposure of capitalism’s brutal incompatibility with human and non-human flourishing is hardly new. It would be naive to presume that the highly visible unequal suffering caused by the pandemic will force a revaluation of values.\u0026nbspAt the same time, in the midst of this crisis, we’re seeing what resistance looks like. Across the US and the UK, mutual aid networks have sprung up where young and able-bodied people are providing food and medical necessities to their elderly and infirm neighbours. These networks of mutual aid and community care are hardly thorns in the side of capital for now, they fill gaps where the state and market are failing. But at their best, they transcend the ethos of charity and recognise how our current system designates certain lives as disposable, while organising towards liberation from within that system. The youth of the Navajo Nation, which s four US states, have self-organised to provide for their elders as their communities are devastated by the pandemic and government neglect. This is life-affirming resistance in the face of an unbroken history of state violence.\u0026nbspThe same can and should be said of the current wave of bold uprisings across nearly every city in the US following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. The protests have shown a righteous anger and resolve that speaks to far greater needs and demands than the indictment of inidual killer police officers. This movement is led by young people but informed by generations of black liberation struggle, responding to centuries of oppression. The battle to abolish the racist status quo has supporters of all ages, who share the urgent desire to see the old world die.\u0026nbspIf the pandemic has crystallised generational antagonisms along class lines, the space for intergenerational solidarity has been, as ever, created by the victims of our racist, capitalist society. We are now witnessing the sort of intergenerational and communal work through which we might begin to value ourselves and each other in new ways: more human than human capital.• Natasha Lennard is a contributing writer for the Intercept and the author of Being Numerous: Essays on Non-Fascist Life"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/875c56ada6293ac4cf454de7dffa258fdd5fea46/0_322_5121_3073/master/5121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7f1b93c518a9b4f56da117eec1d5861","title":"i dont want to have a barbecue not even a lockdown one","story":"The food, the cooking process, our unreliable climate – there’s nothing good about them.

Schools must feel equipped to open when it is safe to do so and the government has a duty to address their valid safety concerns.”Most schools in England have remained open to small numbers of key workers’ children and vulnerable pupils, yet there remained widespread concerns about admitting further pupils safely.The north-east has the highest per-capita infection rate of any region in the UK, and is thought to be particularly vulnerable given its relatively high proportion of people with secondary illnesses linked to heavy industry, such as mining and shipbuilding. Of the 10 worst-affected local authorities, the top four are all in the north-east: Sunderland, Gateshead, South Tyneside and Middlesbrough.In County Durham, Gateshead and Hartlepool, not a single primary school out of 309 reopened to more pupils, reflecting continuing concern among headteachers about the safety of opening up to more pupils. In Newcastle, officials said only two of its 73 primary schools might be able to admit more pupils before next week.  The opening figures for primary schools in England emerged as the Welsh government said schools there would reopen at the end of June, almost a month after the planned phased return began in England.The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, said schools would reopen on 29 June and the summer term would be extended by a week to 27 July, with plans for an additional week off at half term in the next\u0026nbspacademic year. Further education colleges would reopen from 15 June for face-to-face learning, especially\u0026nbspfor vulnerable students and those working towards a licence to practice assessments, she said.The NEU, which has more than 450,000 members, has consistently argued for a later reopening date, when the number of new infections will be lower and the system of testing, tracking and isolation of new cases will have bedded in.Kevin Courtney, the NEU’s joint general secretary, said the figures were a wake-up call for the government. He said many schools intended to delay a wider reopening and that some would not be able to admit all suggested year groups. A number would not take in any further pupils this term beyond the children of key workers and vulnerable children already attending, he added.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.\u0026nbsp“It was always reckless of Boris Johnson to set an arbitrary date and expect schools to fall in line,” he said. “Heads and their staff know far more about their inidual challenges than Whitehall ever will. As the regional variation according to coronavirus levels show, schools are listening to the science rather than politicians.\u0026nbsp“Not only is the safety of the government’s plan in question but also the feasibility of it and confidence of headteachers in what the prime minister requested.”The Department for Education (DfE) has yet to publish any data on pupils returning or schools opening more widely, but ministers anticipate numbers will rise in the coming days and weeks. A DfE spokesperson said: “From this week, many schools have begun welcoming children from reception, year 1 and year 6 back to the classroom as part of a phased and cautious approach.“To prepare for this, headteachers and school staff have been doing an excellent job, including putting protective measures in place and engaging with parents and children. We will continue to support schools who haven’t yet been able to open more widely to do so as soon as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e18c7f4ce40cda8d7b5005879b827d5320ef2cf6/0_168_4197_2518/master/4197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55d3111cecf14f29f67f8ea183348577","title":"world oceans day tell us about issues affecting your local ocean","story":"World Oceans Day is a moment to celebrate the ocean and reflect on how to protect it.

JBS remains unable to monitor a significant proportion of its suppliers despite operating deep in the Amazon, while last year Marfrig admitted that more than half of the cattle it slaughtered originated from indirect suppliers that it could not monitor.According to a joint investigation by the , Unearthed and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, financial data between January 2013 and May 2019 shows that HSBC underwrote $1.1bn of bonds for Marfrig and $917m for Minerva. They also held nearly $3m in JBS shares.\u0026nbspSchroders held $14m in Marfrig bonds and $12m in Minerva bonds, while Standard Life Aberdeen held $10m in Marfrig bonds and $3m in JBS shares. Prudential UK had $23m in JBS shares and $5m in Minerva bonds.\u0026nbspBanks frequently hold bonds and shares on behalf of clients who invest through their asset management funds.Other European-based institutions provided an additional $2.1bn of backing. Santander underwrote $1.4bn worth of bonds across the three companies. Deutsche Bank underwrote $69m worth of Marfrig bonds and loaned JBS $57m.\u0026nbspEuropean institutions also held significant shares in JBS: Crédit Agricole, Deutsche Bank and Santander invested $37m, $12m and $7m respectively. All data was correct as of May 2019.The European Commission is considering new financial reporting rules in light of the coronavirus crisis that would require banks, insurance firms and listed companies to disclose their exposure to bioersity loss and pandemic risk. Scientists have warned that deforestation is increasing the risk of new diseases emerging.Some of the financial institutions told the  they were engaging with the three companies over deforestation, and could reconsider their support if they saw insufficient progress.\u0026nbspThe three meat companies say they are confident that the farms their slaughterhouses directly purchase cattle from are not involved in deforestation, but they also accept they cannot know the origin of some animals that have passed through other farms beforehand.In a statement, JBS said it had blocked thousands of direct suppliers for breaking rules concerning deforestation and was working with the Brazilian government and industry on solutions for monitoring indirect suppliers.Minerva said there was “no accessible and reliable data and statistics on the complete cattle traceability chain” in Brazil and that it was evaluating a new tool developed by the National Wildlife Federation and University of Wisconsin to monitor indirect suppliers. Marfrig said it was developing a tool to combat the risk of buying from indirect suppliers which it cannot monitor. “No UK financial institution should be profiting from the destruction of rainforest or other precious habitats in Brazil or elsewhere. If the government’s claims to global leadership on climate are to have any meaning at all, it must stop turning blind eye to the links between UK banks and deforestation, by introducing strong regulation, harsh penalties and strict provisions on full public transparency of environmental and social impacts of all investment portfolios,” said Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion.In response to the findings, a spokesperson for Aberdeen Standard Investments said: “There are definitely shortcomings in supply chain monitoring for the entire beef industry in Brazil, but these practices are improving across the industry and investor activism plays an important role in this development ... At present, we remain invested but this may change depending on a number of factors.”Schroders said it was in dialogue with both Minerva and Marfrig and that, “if we did not see these signs of progress, we would certainly consider changing our recommendations for these companies.”Deutsche Bank said it did not finance activities where there is clear and known evidence on clearing of primary forests, areas of high conservation value or peat lands, illegal logging or uncontrolled andor illegal use of fire. Crédit Agricole said it did not finance projects on deforested land with high bioersity value.Prudential UK said it was actively engaging with companies operating in the Amazon region to find solutions. HSBC said it conducted reviews of clients for their commitment to sustainable business practices. Santander said it conducted annual reviews of more than 2,000 clients in Brazil, including those that are large soy producers, soy traders and meatpackers, especially about their supply chain.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eaa3066bc0ec0eee64f4b28762ef68ca32c552a/0_56_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=0ca55061fa6217f2d25e1aa5ff76b142","title":"how to make caesar salad recipe felicity cloake masterclass","story":"A guide to making the classic American salad that was, in fact, invented by an Italian restaurateur in MexicoDespite its imperial name, caesar salad was created in 1920s Mexico to feed the hordes of thirsty Americans forced across the border by prohibition. Wanting to relieve the pressure on his kitchen, restaurateur Caesar Cardini came up with a recipe simple enough to be prepared by his waiters instead. The fact it’s also salty and rich enough to pair perfectly with a cold beer is no doubt mere coincidence.2 garlic cloves150ml olive oil4 slices day-old bread, preferably white and chunky2 anchovy fillets1 egg yolkJuice of ½ lemonSalt and ground black pepper2 cos or romaine lettuces1 large handful finely grated parmesan or pecorinoStart by infusing the oil for the dressing. Peel and crush the garlic, either using a press or in a mortar, then mix with the oil and leave to mingle, ideally for an hour or so. If you’re keen to eat immediately, you can bypass this stage, but it gives the finished dish a more mellow flavour, so do make time for it, if you can.At least 20 minutes before you want to eat, heat the oven and a large baking sheet to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6. Cut the bread into rough, crouton-sized cubes (I like to keep mine quite large). You can use just about any bread you want here, but something fairly robust such as a sourdough will give the crunchiest results.Toss the bread cubes in a little of the oil – just enough to coat them, rather than soak them completely – and a pinch of salt (bear in mind that the dressing will be quite salty anyway, thanks to the anchovies), then scatter them over the hot baking sheet, spreading them out well. Bake for about 15 minutes, until golden and crisp.Meanwhile, rinse the anchovy fillets if they’re packed in salt (there’s no need to do this for those in oil), then use a fork to mash them to a smooth paste in the bottom of a large salad bowl if it’s easier, you can do this in a mortar, but scoop them into the serving bowl before moving on to the next step.Beat in the egg yolk until well combined, then gradually whisk in the remaining garlic oil until you have a thickish dressing, rather like a thin mayonnaise.Finally, whisk in the lemon juice and taste: season with plenty of roughly ground black pepper and a little salt, if necessary.Split the lettuces into inidual leaves, then wash and dry well in clean tea towels – the dressing will just run off wet leaves, so it’s important not to skip this step. Originally, caesar salad was finger food for drinkers and the leaves were left whole, but if you intend to eat yours with a knife and fork, tear the leaves into rough pieces.Add the lettuce to the salad bowl and toss to coat in the dressing (I use my hands, but if you’re vigorous enough, two big spoons or some tongs will also do the job).Add the grated cheese and toss again, then scatter over the croutons and serve at once, before the bread has time to go soggy.Chargrilled chicken is often added to turn this salad into a more substantial dish. Bash two chicken breasts out until fairly flat, then rub with olive oil and season. Heat a griddle pan or greased frying pan until sizzling hot, then fry the chicken for about four minutes on each side, until cooked through. Slice and add to the salad at the same time as the croutons.Chargrilled salmon or white fish also works well in a caesar salad, and large prawns are popular in the States, but my favourite topping is warm boiled eggs. Cooked in simmering water for eight minutes and cooled under cold running water, then peeled and quartered, they turn this into a very punchy egg mayonnaise salad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/453f5060511c4eb75941225d53ecbbf773f7286c/0_87_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afec833e945d68a4b67e6145400db461","title":"tottenham reveal unnamed player has tested positive for coronavirus","story":"Tottenham have revealed that one of their players has tested positive for Covid-19 and will self-isolate for seven days, although he is not experiencing any symptoms of the virus. The London club want to keep his identity confidential. It is understood he is not a key first-team player.The positive test was the only one from the Premier League’s fifth and latest round of screening, which took in 1,197 players and members of staff at the 20 clubs – representing another boost on the road to Project Restart.The league has pledged to make public the results of the tests in the interests of transparency and the aggregated numbers now show that there have been 13 positives from 5,073 people screened.The fear has always been that high or rising numbers of infections could jeopardise the plan for the league to restart on 17 June and complete the remaining games by 25 or 26 July but that has not been the case thus far, showing the safety measures introduced at training grounds are proving robust. The isolated positive announced on Wednesday follows zero positive results from the previous round of testing.The league and the clubs will hold their latest conference call on Thursday at which a variety of topics will be discussed. They include curtailment scenarios and a proposed fixture list, together with more technical matters relating to player registration, squad size and substitutes.The politan police says it will look at the final proposed fixture list before recommending whether any games in London should be moved to neutral venues. In Liverpool, the city council’s safety advisory group is due to meet early next week, with Everton hoping it will allow them to stage the derby against Liverpool at Goodison Park over the long weekend of 19‑22 June.Amazon has announced its four remaining televised matches will be made available free to air, to go alongside Sky Sports’ pledge to do the same with 25 of its 64 games and the BBC’s four terrestrial fixtures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08a7a0d8b690d582ea270241f4c94469f5fbd46e/0_0_1464_974/master/1464.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67fb1c97fd5a23c1a51492e997fd8720 700w","title":"dont stand so close to me the new rules of social distancing","story":"As lockdown eases, meeting up with friends has become bewildering. Can you share food – or a hug? Scientists and etiquette experts weigh inFrom this week the lockdown rules in England have relaxed – groups of up to six can meet in an outdoor space, so long as they stay two metres apart. Anyone who can’t work from home has already been told to go back to work – while avoiding public transport. The sceptics among us smell a rat – with the alert level the same and the government’s five tests unmet, track-and-trace not ready and a government desperate to deflect attention from its shortcomings – is this easing really for our benefit, or just a way to kick responsibility back on to the population?\u0026nbspIn other words, we are living in one giant grey area, where judgment, common sense, good faith and, most of all, manners are going to be doing a hell of a lot of heavy lifting. So what advice do the etiquette experts – and the boffins – offer?\u0026nbspWilliam Hanson, an etiquette coach and host of the podcast Help I Sexted My Boss, was born to answer this question. “There was an awful tendency, before all this, to respond to an invitation with: ‘Who else is going to be there?’” (This implies you are checking that it will be cool enough, and is beyond rude.) “Now it is permissible, even healthy, to ask that. But you may still want to disguise the question, so if you’re bringing a cake or a homemade cordial, say: ‘Let me know how many it will be for.’” No manners specialist in town has given me an acceptable get-out for turning up only to find a packed party. Talk numbers before you arrive and then, as Debora Robertson, the co-author of Manners: A Modern Field Guide (out next spring), says: “It’s your job to express clearly what you need in a social situation, so just say: ‘I’m not ready yet for that.’” After that, it’s all in the tone and the intention. “If it’s not your intention to make people feel like they’re reckless or stupid, then that won’t come across in your tone.”\u0026nbspAgain, if you explain yourself plainly and make it a boundary of yours, a decent friend will accept that even if they think you are extremely cautious. Adam Collins, a doctor of emergency medicine, says: “If everything is washed and clean, and everyone, while they’re there, has their own inidual set of plates and cups, that should be fine.”\u0026nbspYou are now allowed to use someone else’s toilet if you wipe down surfaces afterwards. If you don’t want people to use your loo, tell them before they arrive. Regardless, Diana Mather, the author of The Good Manners Bears and host of the Granny Manners YouTube channel, has this timeless piece of advice: “Make sure you go before you leave.”If you’re happy for people to use your loo, Hanson says: “I would, as a host, put Dettol wipes out. I would hope that people got what I was trying to imply.” As a guest, you don’t then need to be sheepish about having cleaned the toilet, because they in effect told you to do that. I know. This is all getting pretty intense.\u0026nbspAccording to Mather, absolutely not as long as you would normally. The longer you are there, the more some of you will drink, the less observant of social distancing you will become, the more of an awkward spot you will put anxious friends and relatives in. It’s not a four-hour gig. It would be polite, as a host, to set the terms – shall we have a drink between six and seven? – “And if it gets to seven and people are still chatting,” Mather says, “you can push it to half past seven.” How do you make people leave, though? This bit is easy, apparently. “You stand up,” Mather says authoritatively. “Everyone should take that hint.”There is no way to not offer these around, yet I’m struggling to see how you would get a Quaver off someone without coming closer than two metres, so it’s sort of a pass-agg move. You’re asking them to either break the rules or make a big deal out of not breaking them. I think you just have to eat these things privately, or buy more than one bag of Quavers.At a whole population level, public health agencies are trying to move people away from buffet-style eating, where you are all digging in to the same bowl, and a large number of people are using the same serving spoon. However, this doesn’t mean that you can’t safely cut a cake for six people or prepare salads for people.Hanson says: “If it’s a serious breach that is breaking the rules, then fine. But be prepared, if it becomes known who reported them, that is a serious breach of friendship and you probably won’t be friends with them going forward.” Robertson is more trenchant: “We’ve all got to stop the grassing-up thing. It came too easily to some people.” I think, from both a moral and manners perspective, no.\u0026nbspIt’s really up to you, but don’t leave things because you feel embarrassed or awkward. Robertson says: “Phone them up, or email, or send a postcard to re-establish connection. Just be normal, don’t be weird.”Remember, too, that it’s not all about you. We all have a tendency to blame ourselves when communication breaks down, but it takes two not to tango. “There’s this brilliant story in the Duchess of Devonshire’s autobiography,” Robertson says. “She’s upstairs on her wedding day, and she’s waiting to come down, and 85 million people are waiting to see her. And she says to her mother: ‘I feel a bit shy.’ And her mother says: “Don’t be ridiculous, nobody’s looking at you.’” I mean, it is brilliant. But mothers are also weird.\u0026nbspI am currently going with: “I have nothing to say and I hate Zoom.”Collins takes the point: “Given that you’re allowed to have as many different sets of six people as you want, to me, that’s no different to having a barbecue of 12.” This is the moment at which you berate them with science. The magic number is because any group larger than six finds it hard to stay in the same conversation, at two metres apart, so will naturally start to cluster together. Just be reasonable, is the overall medical message here.\u0026nbspSomeone doing it by accident can be repelled by a light remark. With a deliberate offender, Hanson says, you have to be firm. “You have got to step in and say: ‘It’s two metres, I’d appreciate if you would respect that.’ I wouldn’t say sorry, necessarily. Keep it short. If you soften it too much, it will weaken the impact. I know some of my friends probably would transgress, and I just won’t meet up with them until this is over.”Children are relatively unaffected by Covid and yet Covid\u0026nbspis all we think about. But there’s a danger that because of this we might forget about their other needs altogether. Heneghan counsels strongly against this. “There’s been a lack of thinking about our younger generation, right across the board up to university age. They are at such low risk, them going back to school is no more risky than it is after Christmas, when there’s been an outbreak of influenza.” They need education, but they also need fellowship, play, fresh air and normality. So yes, they should be allowed to play with one another. If they are too young to observe any meaningful social distance, you just have to chase them apart (try not to be terrifying).Heneghan says: “I got into a car with a person on Saturday. I’m also an urgent care GP, he had to drive me around. The important point here is that we’ve come through an era where, if you’re ill, you take a paracetamol and carry on. That has to end. The important alertness is that if you feel unwell, you have to take it seriously and get yourself a test.”Collins gives something close to a definitive answer on this, and all things: “What people should focus on is not: ‘Can I do this specific thing?’ It’s: ‘What am I doing here that is genuinely beneficial or genuinely necessary?’ Lockdown is driving us all a little bit crazy and it affects some people’s mental health in really serious ways.” It’s really not as simple as: “Responsible people stay locked down for ever” and very few rules are absolute. “You have to ask yourself, honestly, whether you’re doing everything you can to protect yourself and protect others.”Oh, hello fresh minefield. Alan Redman is an organisational psychologist at Birkbeck, University of London, with a sideline in the psychology of commuter cycling. His top manners tips are: “One, wavesmile at other riders. Always. Two, don’t shout at drivers or pedestrians. Three, don’t overtake and then immediately slow down.” More broadly, he says, there is too much focus on commuting being terrifying – it is at the start, but people overcome that fairly fast and afterwards get a huge sense of zeal from their sense of legitimacy on the road and their feeling of having sailed over the fear barrier.\u0026nbspAs it is allowed for two people to meet, there is no reason you can’t go out on a date, so long as you can cope with pubs not being open. Given the two-metre distance, however, you probably can’t do much else. There is a hilarious legal loophole, here – as of this week it is illegal for two people from different households to meet indoors and have sex. The rules around outdoor gatherings, however, are guidance not law, so in theory you could breach your two-metre rule and have sex in the garden without getting arrested. So long as you weren’t overlooked, which would of course breach another law. And so long as there were six of you. No, wait …\u0026nbspYou can continue to hug members of your own household. You can definitely hug any of the six people you have just had outdoor sex with, in for a penny etc (joke! This is a joke). People I’ve been extremely tempted to hug include those who have definitely had the virus already, with the antibody test to prove it, and those who are at the end of their lives and claim not to care whether they get it or not. The expert advice remains: do not hug any of these people.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad5485d1cfd8df6c5003d96e91766693683c0f72/607_303_5007_3004/master/5007.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2aa9ee161cc2dbf94d16a4d7d766e91","title":"ive never felt so close to anyone this quickly the whirlwind romances of lockdown","story":"In March, couples in England were advised to move in together or stay apart to avoid coronavirus. What happened to those in new relationships who went for it?Hurtling down the motorway on a Triumph T120 with a backpack full of knickers, Jen Lewandowski thought: this is terrific. Lewandowski, 41, had met Tom Gidley, 51, just four times before she moved into his Ramsgate home at the beginning of the coronavirus lockdown in March.\u0026nbspThey originally met through work. Lewandowski had contacted Gidley, who is an artist, to ask if she could sell some of his paintings at an exhibition she was staging. When she collected the paintings from his studio in January, there was an instant connection. “She had an energy and real light about her,” says Gidley. After the show opened in March, they went for a drink, and then a cup of tea at Lewandowski’s kitchen table. Finally, Lewandowski, who lives in London, visited him for the weekend.\u0026nbspThen the lockdown measures were announced. “I said: ‘Look, why don’t you just come down here?’” says Gidley. “Everything’s getting a bit strange.” She agreed, and Gidley collected her on his motorcycle. Since that high-speed jaunt, their relationship has barely slackened in pace. They have spent the entire lockdown together, said “I love you” to each other within days and are in general horribly in love. “Isn’t it wild?” giggles Lewandowski. “It is quite whirlwind, but it feels right, and we’re going with it.”Gidley and Lewandowski are just one example of the British couples turbocharging their relationships by moving in together during the coronavirus lockdown despite scarcely knowing each other. On 24 March, a day after the lockdown was introduced in England, the deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, suggested that couples living apart may want to consider moving in together. “They should test the strength of their relationship,” said Harries at a government press conference, “and decide whether one wishes to be permanently resident in another household.”Harries’ comments sent couples across the country scrambling into crisis talks, as they tried to decide whether moving in together during a global pandemic was a good idea, a bit premature or potential disaster. During this time, many came to the conclusion that it was worth a shot – the partner could just move out again if everything went down the toilet. “I didn’t really have an exit strategy,” confesses Jack McGarey, a 31-year-old teacher. “I suppose, at the back of my head, I thought: ‘If it doesn’t work out, she can just go home.’”McGarey is a bold man: he asked Francesca Elizabeth Williams, a 33-year-old marketer, to move in with him after just one date. After matching on Bumble, the couple had gone for a physically distanced walk in Crowthorne, where they both live, on 21 March, just before the lockdown restrictions came in. After the walk, at a loss for what to suggest – most restaurants and bars had by then closed – Williams invited McGarey over for dinner. He arranged the furniture so it would be two metres apart. “We didn’t want to break the rules,” McGarey says. “We had good intentions.” He groans. “Obviously, the night started with social distancing,” Williams says, “but as the night wore on and we had a few glasses of wine, we didn’t keep our distance.”Two days later, the lockdown began. “I said: ‘Grab your gym kit and your laptop, and come over.” Williams never left. When we speak, the couple are still syrupy sweet on each other. Every day, they stick to a strict schedule of thrice-daily exercise (a morning 5k run, a yoga class and evening high-intensity interval training workout), meditate, listen to a podcast together, cook and have a “deep chat” about their families or childhoods. “We do an audit later in the day,” says McGarey, “to make sure that we’ve ticked everything off.” It may sound hellish to some, but it’s working for them – although they haven’t said, “I love you,” yet, it’s clearly on the cards. “A few times, I almost said it,” admits Williams shyly, “but then I thought it was too soon.”Still, it is easy to rush headlong into a whirlwind romance when you are young. Time takes the edge off romantic ardour: we become cynical, crablike, cautious. “I’ve learned a lot over the years,” muses Jonathan Lovett, a 53-year-old design director from London. “You have to look for someone who is emotionally available. So many people think they want relationships, but they don’t really.” He met his boyfriend, Kit Yunes, 45, an Argentinian-born, London-based retail worker, on a dating app in February.\u0026nbspWhen the lockdown restrictions came in, Lovett and Yunes were in a music shop, waiting to buy a drum kit. “I turned to Kit,” Lovett says, “and said: ‘Where are we going to put these drums, then?’” The men got an Uber to Lovett’s house, drum kit in boot, and Yunes never left.\u0026nbspExperience has made both men certain that their relationship is durable, and not mere infatuation. “We’re not in a sort of puppy love,” Lovett insists. But the speed at which they have moved has raised eyebrows among some of their friends, particularly when Yunes gave up his rented property and officially moved in. “Some people have said: ‘What if this doesn’t work? You don’t want to end up homeless in a pandemic,’” Yunes says. He is unconcerned. “I am happy to take this risk. Everything feels natural, not rushed. I’ve never felt so close to another partner in my life this quickly.”Still, living with someone and picking up their socks when you have milk in your fridge that’s probably older than your relationship – there’s no way for that not to be weird.\u0026nbsp“You catch yourself laughing at how surreal it is,” Lewandowski jokes. “How did this happen?” Adjusting to the rhythms of another person’s life, their schedule, their caprices, takes time. “You definitely have to negotiate around each other,” Gidley says. “The proximity is wonderful, but it takes work to get the balance right.” He has noticed they tend to have a tiny bust-up when they’re tired, on Friday evenings – which they always resolve immediately. “It’s like a pressure valve,” Gidley says. “It feels healthy.”Is there any way to tell how a relationship formed under the weight of a global pandemic can go? “All things are possible,” says the Relate counsellor Gurpreet Singh. “I don’t think there is a single rule that applies.” Moving in prematurely will exacerbate underlying stressors. “Couples who move in together too soon haven’t worked out a strategy for resolving arguments amicably,” he says. “If you end up in a lockdown situation too soon, you may drive each other up the wall a little bit, and that might put you off the relationship.”\u0026nbspTaking a punt on love doesn’t always go to plan. Emily, a 26-year-old student from Birmingham, met Neil (not their real names) on Bumble in late March: they went on a date just before the lockdown was announced. “I went over to his, and we had a nice time,” says Emily, “so I ended up staying over. He seemed quite keen for me to stay again the next night, so I did, and then I ended up staying for the weekend.” When Neil asked her to stay with him during the coronavirus lockdown, Emily agreed. “I thought it would be a way of helping each other through a mutually difficult time,” she says. “Maybe, in retrospect, I wasn’t using my best judgment.”The two cohabited together amicably, at first mostly because Emily swallowed her feelings. When Neil was on video calls with his family and friends, he didn’t mention she was there. “He was cagey,” Emily says. “I felt like he was trying to conceal me and our relationship, whatever it was.” The anxiety gnawed away at her. “I finally cracked,” she says. “I said that I was uncomfortable and anxious about where I stood. He said he wasn’t ready for a relationship yet.” That must have been tough, I say, after living together for two months as a quasi-couple. “The fact that it was so intense –\u0026nbspI suppose I expected a little bit more,” Emily says flatly. “I wish he had been a bit more honest about his expectations because then I wouldn’t have opened up so much and allowed myself to fall for him.”\u0026nbspEmily isn’t bitter about her decision to move in with Neil, even though it ended badly. “I don’t regret it,” she says. “Last year, I was serially dating, mostly through apps, and not getting much out of it.\u0026nbspThis seemed like a nice chance to give a relationship a go, without overthinking it all the time.”The pandemic has given prospective partners the opportunity to connect outside a brutal and sometimes dehumanising dating scene. “With online dating,” says Gidley, “it can feel horribly like a marketplace. It encourages you to think there’s always another option out there, so you never commit to anyone, even if you really like each other.”In our hyperscheduled modern lives, having the time and space to get to know someone away from work, family and friends means that lovers can develop an intimacy that would take months, even years, to gestate under ordinary circumstances. “It’s given us a bubble of time to build our closeness,” says Lewandowski. “I think that intimacy would be hard to achieve when normal life is happening.” In lockdown, time speeds up, slips forward, accelerates. A meal at your kitchen table together is the equivalent of three real-world dinner dates. A Zoom quiz with friends feels like hitting the three-month mark.\u0026nbsp“You feel like you have time to waste, almost,” says Lovett. “Nothing has to just be a conversation over dinner. You can have conversations for hours or even days. That’s the beauty of it. It’s been so intense.” Lovett travels abroad frequently for work and doubts he would have had the time to grow so close to Yunes were it not for the lockdown. “I’d have had to make space for him in my daily routine, seeing my friends, going to work, the gym,” agrees Yunes. “It would have taken a lot longer.”\u0026nbspThis is dating on steroids: a time-lapse fast-forward stumble through all the major relationship milestones. “It feels like we’ve been together for six months,” says McGarey, “not six weeks.” They plan to move to Texas together later this year, so that McGarey can take up a teaching job. “I want to be where Jack is,” Williams says. They have met each other’s families – on Zoom, of course.Lewandowski compares the heady excitement of her lockdown romance to the shotgun weddings of the second world war. “There’s something old-fashioned about it,” she says. “We haven’t met any of each other’s friends or families. It reminds me of those old movies where the soldier coming back from the war hops off a train with his new bride.”But a better comparison may be prison. “Those who have relationships in prison have better mental health than those who don’t have a partner or have a partner outside prison,” says Dr Rodrigo González of the University of Salamanca. He has conducted research into relationships in Spanish prisons. “It’s partly about companionship,” González says. “But it’s mostly about sex. Having sex relates to better mental health and higher satisfaction levels in the public as well as prison inmates.” He’s probably on to something: the always practical Dutch authorities even recommended that single people find a designated “sex buddy” during lockdown.Is the intimacy these couples feel real? Or are they punch-drunk on the surreal enforced intimacy of a global pandemic? “It’s as real as it can be,” says Singh. “If they’ve coped well together during these times, it would give me the sense there is strength in the relationship.” But Singh points out that none of the couples will have met each other’s family or friends in real life or had to balance commuting, living apart or work commitments. “Good, healthy relationships are formed over time, when people have lived in each other’s lives during periods of vulnerability,” Singh says. “You can’t build that in a few days.”“Reality is the true test of any relationship,” Lovett admits. “We’ve been in this bubble, but I know it’s coming very quickly – the real world.” But he’s confident they will go the distance. “People may be cynical,” Lovett says. “But sometimes you’ve just got to take that leap of faith.”Lewandowski and Gidley certainly are. On a beautiful Saturday afternoon in the Kent Downs a few weeks ago, Gidley asked Lewandowski to marry him. “I said yes,” Lewandowski says, “and we had a lovely kiss. Just as we did, the wind picked up! It went: whoosh. It was very romantic.” Lewandowski lets out a peal of laughter. “It’s a good job we’re in lockdown because if people could see us, they would puke,” she cries. “Let’s just see if it lasts!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf68f7376d4b9da9321f741b00074c2845bff4f7/0_180_3934_2361/master/3934.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3af80bed6496322dc5faedbb6ac98529","title":"the 100 greatest uk no 1s no 2 the specials ghost town","story":"The remarkable, dark power of this song, with its harrowing wail of a chorus, plunges you straight back into the anger, violence and despair of the early 80sBut the Specials were falling apart. They were overworked and riven with internal disagreements about the jazz and easy-listening-influenced direction leader Jerry Dammers was taking them in. They were a band born out of political and racial tension. They had changed their name from the Coventry Automatics and started playing a punky take on ska, with lyrics pleading for racial tolerance and unity, after a 1978 gig supporting the Clash was disrupted by the National Front. But now political and racial tension was threatening to engulf them. Guitarist Lynval Golding was seriously injured in a racist attack in south London. Gigs on their late 1980 tour were marred by audience violence: in Cambridge, Dammers and vocalist Terry Hall were arrested and charged with incitement to riot after trying to stop the fighting. The band announced they would quit touring.Things came to a head in the studio while trying to record their next single, Ghost Town, a song Dammers had spent a year writing, horrified by what he had seen on the road: “In Liverpool, all the shops were shuttered up, everything was closing down. Margaret Thatcher had apparently gone mad, she was closing down all the industries, throwing millions of people on the dole. You could see that frustration and anger in the audience. It was clear that something was very, very wrong.”The day before Ghost Town reached No 1, Britain erupted. There had been riots in Brixton the previous month, sparked by a new police stop-and-search policy named Operation Swamp 81 after Margaret Thatcher’s 1978 assertion that the UK “might be rather swamped by people of a different culture”: 943 people – the vast majority of them black – were stopped by plainclothes officers in six days.On 10 July, a second wave of rioting spread across the country: Brixton, Southall, Battersea, Dalston, Streatham and Walthamstow in London, Handsworth in Birmingham, Chapeltown in Leeds, Highfields in Leicester, and many other cities including Edinburgh, Luton, Sheffield, Portsmouth, Preston, Newcastle, Derby, Southampton, Nottingham, Wolverhampton, Stockport and Cardiff all reported “riots” of varying degrees. In the past, No 1 singles had occasionally alluded to recent events or a prevalent mood – the blissed-out ambience and dippy logic of the Summer of Love was encapsulated by Procul Harum’s A Whiter Shade of Pale and the Beatles’ All You Need Is Love a sense of trepidation around the moon landings found a voice in David Bowie’s Space Oddity and Zager and Evans’s In the Year 2525 – but nothing before had developed the terrible currency of Ghost Town, and nor has anything since.Backstage at Top of the Pops for their No 1-crowning performance, Hall, Staples and Golding announced they were leaving the band: the Specials effectively broke up. Over the following 39 years, there have been reformations and recriminations of varying degrees of seriousness. And, over the same period of time, 2 Tone has slipped into the realm of BBC Radio 2 and TV advert soundtracks, stripped of its fraught context and connotations, a cheery, nostalgic knees-up embodied by A Message to You Rudy and Our House: “Britain at its Best”. But Ghost Town hasn’t made the same journey. It was the Specials’ biggest hit and one of the biggest-selling singles of 1981. Its sound seems to presage a lot of subsequent music – you can hear its gloomy echoes everywhere from Massive Attack to Burial – but you almost never hear it on the radio or TV. Perhaps it’s too bleak, too disturbing, its tone too hopeless: a reminder of something we’d rather forget. It sits in the past, brooding and glowering at us, its remarkable, dark power undimmed.

David Hunter, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the University of Oxford, looks at the risks Early estimates of R0, the original infection rate, for Covid-19 were in the range of 2.0 to 3.0, but more recent estimates have come in at 4.0 or more. This is substantially higher than the usual estimate for influenza of about 1.4 to 2.0. The infection rate dropped incrementally with the series of recommendations that started on 12 March, but did not fall precipitously until the full lockdown was announced 11 days later. Those restrictions have meant the R0 now appears to be below 1.0 in the UK, and on Monday the government eased some of the lockdown rules, allowing people to meet outside in groups of up to six, outdoor markets and car showrooms to begin operating again, and schools to reopen. But is it actually safe? David Hunter, professor of epidemiology at the University of Oxford, talks to Rachel Humphreys about the risks involved in lifting lockdown too early.

Most of them, the country’s office for statistics said, had chosen to keep their British passport, as remains possible during the transition period ending on 31 December 2020.“Of those Brits that have managed to get a German passport, all of them reported Brexit as a key motivation,” said Daniel Tetlow, co-founder of the British in Germany association and co-author of a study by the Oxford in Berlin research partnership and the Berlin Social Science Centre looking at the impact of Brexit uncertainty on migration patterns.“For most of the people we spoke with, it didn’t mean any kind of rejection of Britishness but more the compliment of being British European. And it’s a plain insurance policy, a no-brainer for Britons who have their livelihoods here and want to continue to have the rights and freedoms that come with an EU passport.”While Brits can try to apply for German citizenship after living in the country for six years, most of those who were naturalised in 2019 had been away from the UK for longer: half of those who gained citizenship last year had been in Germany for more than 26 years.They also tended to be older than those applicants with a Turkish, Polish or Syrian background: half of the Britons who applied for a German passport were aged above 54 years old. The oldest applicants were aged 90.Tetlow said one of the reasons why the numbers of granted applications had risen so steeply was that German officials had also spotted the current circumstances as an opportunity to get British workers to commit to the country long term.“One thing we have seen, for example, is German immigration offices committing more staff to deal specifically with British applications,” Tetlow said.“There has been no schadenfreude on the part of German officials, just a lot of solidarity in spite of the tone of the political debate around Brexit.”While the total number of people granted British citizenship over the same period were comparable, Germans in Britain appeared to be more reluctant to commit to a British passport. Out of 125,346 applications for naturalisation granted in the UK in 2019, only 3,269 were by German citizens."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91b90276e6b609c799fe30dddc44f1dade1c2001/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=913b00a8f98ea585439703514dbac772","title":"no hiding place for boris at pmqs","story":"PM flounders as he tries to answer Keir Starmer’s questions on coronavirus You can sense the growing disbelief and anger. All his life Boris Johnson has been told that he is the Special One. A person for whom all rules are there to be broken. He is a man who has consistently managed to fail upwards. Sacked from one job for lying or incompetence, he has always effortlessly moved on to a better one. Friends, family and children have only ever been collateral damage in a ruthless pursuit of an entitled ambition.Yet now there is no hiding place. Boris has achieved his narcissistic goal of becoming prime minister and from here the only way is down. And it’s a lonely place to be because even he can’t escape the fact that he’s just not cut out for the top job. It’s not just that it’s too much like hard work and he is basically lazy: it’s that he’s not that good at it. Lame gags, bluster and Latin free association just don’t cut it.Put simply, Boris isn’t as bright as he has come to believe he is. In fact, he’s quite dim. And nowhere is this more evident than when he’s up against Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions in front of a near empty chamber. During their first few outings, much was made of how Boris crumbled in the face of the Labour leader’s forensic questioning. But now it’s clear Johnson can’t cope with any kind of questioning at all. Because even when Starmer isn’t at his absolute sharpest, Boris begins to fall apart. It’s as if he knows he’s up against a man of greater intellect and morality and his only defence is to lash out.It doesn’t help that Boris has become his own worst enemy. The charmer turned charmless. Mr Happy turned Mr Angry. It also doesn’t help that even when his friends at the Daily  try to big him up with a story about how he was going to take direct control over the government’s handling of the coronavirus, they only succeed in teeing up Starmer with his first free hit. Who had been in charge of the government during the past three months? Apart from Classic Dom of course. Because we could all take that as read.Boris immediately became defensive and snappy. He had always been in control. All that was changing was that now he would be in total control. Besides, he stood behind what the government had done so far. There hadn’t been many other countries that had managed to kill so many of its citizens through negligence and indifference, so that was something of which we should all be proud. Besides why was the Labour leader standing up and asking him all these difficult questions when he could easily have been more supportive?This left Starmer rather perplexed as he had a copy of a letter he had written to the prime minister a fortnight ago offering to help find a solution on reopening schools to which he had not yet received a reply. “Um … er,” said the floundering Boris. He had rung him back. Except he hadn’t. He had merely spoken to all the opposition leaders on a joint conference call.There was something almost pathetic about Boris pleading for people to trust him at the very moment he was lying. Starmer merely pointed out that trust had to be earned, and returned to the charge sheet. Why had Johnson eased lockdown restrictions when the woman in charge of track and trace on which the new guidance was predicated had said the programme wouldn’t be fully functional till the end of the month? Why had the guidelines been altered when the threat was still stuck at level 4?By now it was clear that Starmer had got under Boris’s skin, and Johnson began to visibly fall apart as he tugged at his hair, tried to prevent his chin from wobbling and angrily jabbed his finger. A prime minister unable to differentiate between being picked on and being subjected to the bare minimum of democratic scrutiny. For Boris even the most modest of criticism is interpreted as a personal betrayal. He might not be very good but he was doing his very best and it was about time the Labour leader and the rest of the country expressed their gratitude for that.As so often, the leaders’ exchanges ended with Boris doing a U-turn on government policy. If you had to guess from PMQs who was running the country then you’d have to say it was Starmer. Only the previous day, Johnson had insisted on a three-line whip in support of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s plans to institutionalise discrimination into the workings of the Commons. Now it sounded very much as if he had had a change of mind. Which had meant that much of Tuesday’s proceedings had been as big a waste of time as MPs queueing up for 90 minutes to deprive absent MPs of a vote.Not that queueing was necessarily a bad thing, Boris ad-libbed. The public had queued for Ikea so it was right for MPs to get their knees dirty and queue to vote as well. Even though there was a fully functional alternative up and running already. It’s getting harder and harder to know where satire ends and reality starts. Boris breathed a sigh of relief when Starmer’s six questions came to an end, but there was no let up. The SNP’s Ian Blackford twice asked Boris to condemn President Trump’s handling of the riots in the US – teargassing peaceful protesters to get a photo op in front of a church had been a particular low point – and twice the prime minister declined. Even Theresa May got in on the act by asking a Brexit question he couldn’t answer. How the Tory benches could do with her at PMQs right now.The truth is that Boris is a beaten man even before he stands up to speak at the dispatch box. He knows that. Keir knows that. Worst of all, the country knows that. The shouting is all just empty, white noise. A distraction from his own limitations. And at a time of national crisis you can’t get away with putting that on the side of a bus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b8b8805437778de95a7e9d93b072451409b5227/1401_1662_2525_1516/master/2525.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e483f0d75f789292e880abca6f407f48","title":"uk coronavirus live covid 19 latest updates news","story":"News updates: latest updates on the UK coronavirus situation and responseThe business secretary, Alok Sharma, might have had a bout of “severe hayfever” when he appeared ill in the House of Commons on Wednesday, according to the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Lewis said: “I don’t want to be premature because Alok, who I wish well and hope he recovers quickly, may well have had severe hayfever, we’re not sure yet.”He denied that Sharma’s case supported the argument for virtual voting in the Commons to be resumed. He said: It is important for parliamentarians to be able to properly scrutinise legislation, not just for Covid but for the wider legislative agenda we have to continue with for people across the country, but to do so within proper guidelines.That’s what the house authorities have set up, that’s what’s been working over the last few days and that’s a very good thing.It highlights Alok’s situation, if he has got coronavirus, why it is so important that if you are in a work environment, you have got to follow the guidelines.Lisa McNally, public health director at Sandwell council in the West Midlands, said she was surprised the lockdown had been eased before the test and trace system was “at full speed”. She told the Today programme:This system is certainly up but I’m not sure about running.I don’t think I’m particularly surprised, to be honest, that this system isn’t running effectively in a few short days - it was never going to be, it is an enormous task.What surprises me, I guess, is that we are moving ahead so quickly with easing lockdown before the system is at full speed.We need to allow time to assess how things are going, get this system up to speed.To be honest with you, I’m concerned that by the time we realise we need to hit the brakes, we will have spun off the road and be over the cliff-edge.McNally predicted the UK could be “going back to a place we really don’t want to be, which is where we were at the end of April” in terms of the number of coronavirus-related infections and deaths if test and trace did not prove effective.In his first interview since the resignation of Douglas Ross over Dominic Cummings last week, the Scottish Conservative leader, Jackson Carlaw, has said that the prime minister’s adviser had left people “perplexed and angry”, that his explanation for his trip to Durham during lockdown was “wholly unconvincing” and that “I do believe that he should have gone”.After Ross, the Scotland Office minister resigned, Carlaw’s initial statement was considered to be fairly non-committal about Cummings’ behaviour, though he firmed up his position later in the day. Carlaw was pressed on whether he had made his views clear to Boris Johnson, and whether he had as much influence on Downing Street as his predecessor Ruth Davidson, he said that “who is employed by the prime minister is a matter for the prime minister”.Asked about the promotion of Milton Keynes MP Iain Stewart to the Scotland Office to replace Ross, he refused to agree it was a point of principle that Scottish MPs should represent their country. Tens of thousands of Britons have had to be retested for coronavirus following a controversial decision to send swabs to a US laboratory.Almost 30,000 Britons will have to be retested for coronavirus costing taxpayer hundreds of thousands of pounds, the  reports. Ministers admitted that 67,000 Covid-19 tests were sent to a lab in the US over 10 days at the beginning of last month, after capacity at a lab in Northern Ireland suddenly stopped processing samples.The newspaper reveals that when these tests were returned to the UK, more than four in 10 — nearly 30,000 — were “voided” because of the way they had been processed. The cost to the taxpayer is likely to have run into hundreds of thousands of pounds.Morning and welcome to the UK liveblog on the coronavirus.

Finally, the business secretary, Alok Sharma, has been tested for coronavirus after feeling unwell while delivering a statement in the House of Commons. Sharma has gone home to self-isolate following his appearance at the dispatch box earlier on Wednesday.His suspected illness is likely to cause concern about the government’s decision to bring back parliament in its physical form, after weeks of allowing MPs to attend remotely via video link."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be66345b9fa9784fa76c8f7f9c3641de9ef277e9/0_38_4420_2651/master/4420.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=802f0853c02f31ffc032e0f21aaa0502","title":"rugby union dan carter return new zealand","story":"Former All Blacks flyhalf Dan Carter has made a surprise return to New Zealand domestic rugby after an absence of five years by joining the Auckland Blues.Carter confirmed he had signed for the team for the Super Rugby Aotearoa competition after his first training session with the side on Thursday. The 10-week competition features all five of New Zealand’s Super Rugby sides and starts on 13 June.“It’s a chance to put the boots on ... whether I play or not,” Carter said. “I have not played for several months so it will be a number of weeks before I will be ready to be considered to play. And then only if my form warrants it. I’m fit but not rugby fit.”The 38-year-old spent his entire professional career in New Zealand with the Canterbury Crusaders before he went to France after the 2015 Rugby World Cup.He spent the last two seasons in Japan with Kobelco Steelers before the Covid-19 outbreak ended the 2020 Top League campaign. Carter said in April he would not be returning to Japan but that he had not retired, and a conversation with one of his sons convinced him he should sign with the Blues.Blues coach Leon MacDonald, a former All Blacks and Crusaders teammate of Carter, said the side were lucky to have the three-times World Rugby Player of the Year in the squad.“Some of the young guys are pinching themselves,” MacDonald said. “They don’t know whether to shake his hand or get an autograph.”The Blues, who have struggled for direction and success since Carlos Spencer’s departure 15 years ago, now boast Carter and Beauden Barrett as their playmaker options for the looming season.The brilliant Barrett is expected to be the starting No 10 when the Blues host the Hurricanes in the opening round next week.That game was expected to be all about Barrett, a nine-season Hurricane who has yet to make his Blues debut. However, two-time world player of the year Barrett acknowledged the game’s profile had gone to another level following Carter’s move.“How good eh?

People are supposed to stay one metre apart, and as throughout the lockdown, there will be a visible police presence ready to hand out fines, especially when late-night drinking at gets out of hand at hotspots such as Fondamenta dei Ormesini, Campo Santa Margherita and Campo Bella Vienna by the Rialto.Venice started gradually reopening early, from 14 May, and residents already see the greatest difference at weekends. Walking around Venice on weekdays is like stepping back in time, with most streets and squares deserted, vaporetti empty apart from rush hour, and the Rialto market, which stayed open throughout, no longer packed with slow-moving tour groups. The still waters of canals are disturbed only by slender wooden boats, rowed by locals standing up in classic gondolier style, rather than the moto ondoso waves made by speeding water taxis. How long it will stay like this is the big question, and no one can agree on the answer.\u0026nbspEverywhere I walk, bars and osterie are busy, with staff in masks and gloves, and customers using smartphones to scan barcodes on menus. While the flagship Architecture Biennale has been postponed till 2021, the Venice Film Festival is going ahead from 2-12 September, and the weekend of 18 July will see the traditional Festa della Redentore firework display. From 15 June, cinemas and theatres reopen, and the Fenice opera house is planning a spectacular musical installation, whose details are still secret. And the long sandy beaches of the Lido are already open, with spaced sun loungers awaiting a summer invasion. The many campsites along this Adriaticcoast are already gearing up for a short but hectic summer season.Two-star Hotel Guerrini near the railway stationis expecting its first guests on 11 June. “We already have two reservations for that day, so we will be open, as we have been for over 80 years,” says owner Adriano Mazzo. “Everything will be slow at first, to be sure, but we have had several inquiries from foreign travellers about availability and reservations in November and December.”Luxury hotels are not all rushing to reopen, but Giampaolo Ottazzi, director of the iconic Cipriani, tells me: “We will be greeting guests again from 19 June and I hope that flights arriving again at Italian airports will permit the return of our international clientele alongside Italian guests. In terms of reservation enquiries, the US market is especially interested from August onwards, whereas UK travellers are waiting to learn how and when they will be able to come here again.”He says the Cipriani is already getting enquires from countries such as Germany, Switzerland, Austria and France as well as places in the Middle East. “I believe there really is a strong desire to travel again, especially with family”Not everyone here is welcoming back tourists with open arms. Environmental scientist Jane da Mosto is co-founder and director of the NGO We Are Here Venice, and is also active in the movement against cruise ships. She says: “We have a genuine opportunity today to change the future of Venice, and when the free movement of people is restored, we have to stop having such a tourism-dominated economy. There is a lot of idealist talk going around, but government is not putting forward any serious, coherent policies or proposals at this unique moment. We can seize the chance to reinvent Venice and capitalise on the human potential of the residents of what is still a living city. To ‘save Venice’ you have to save the residents first, give them affordable places to live and alternative work opportunities.”Her views are echoed by Cesare Benelli of fine-dining restaurant Al Covo . “This is the moment we must grab to definitively change Venice, limit the number of visitors and stop the daily mass invasion of people who contribute nothing and disrespect our special city,” he says. “Yes, this may mean restaurants serving preheated pastas and microwaved pizzas have to close, along with gift shops peddling poor-quality carnival masks, plastic gondolas and fake Murano glass. Well so be it.”As I walk through quiet backstreets towards Saint Mark’s Square, gondolier Mauro Tochi is patiently waiting for customers. “We were asked to come back on duty from 1 June, ready to welcome visitors again,” he says, “but I don’t expect any work for the first few weeks, till flights really start working again in July. If there is one place in the world people will want to come back to when they can travel again I honestly believe it will be Venice. Nothing compares to our city. But I hope also that this new generation of tourists that come here will respect the city more. Who knows, maybe they will start listening to what I tell them of the history of the Serenissima as we glide down the canals, rather than snapping selfies and talking on their phones.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c3ca12e81f976ff6bf2cb6629480ca07be19ccd/0_570_2625_1575/master/2625.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cffdee7ddc46f79fa02ba6568073b463","title":"share your coronavirus contact tracing experiences with us","story":"Whether you are a contact tracer or have taken part in the scheme, we would like to hear from youOn Thursday 25,000 new contact tracers started speaking to those with coronavirus and tracing people they have come into close contact with over the past two weeks.

The colour doesn’t matter.”Camargo also sought to burnish his credentials as a supporter of Bolsonaro’s political idol, Donald Trump, retweeting a post from the US president about the unrest there following the killing of George Floyd. “LAW \u0026amp ORDER!” it said.In a statement the Palmares foundation, which takes its name from a vast 17th-century community of runaway slaves, said it regretted the “illegal recording of an internal and private meeting”.The foundation said it was now “in sync” with Bolsonaro’s federal government and would no longer attend the interests of only those “who proclaim themselves to be representatives of the entire black population”.The pinned tweet of the man now responsible for nurturing Afro-Brazilian culture reads: “I owe everything to the education I received from my parents. I owe nothing to Africa. Nothing to my skin colour. Nothing to the left!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3369c901a7e1c6a923361fd5c1f9aa9b817c994c/119_68_1532_919/master/1532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fd00734a2436c1dc78e4b423a2d95d0","title":"business secretary alok sharma coronavirus test speech commons","story":"Alok Sharma self-isolating after feeling unwell while delivering statement on WednesdayAlok Sharma, the business secretary, has been tested for coronavirus after feeling unwell while delivering a statement in the House of Commons.The cabinet minister has gone home to self-isolate following his appearance at the dispatch box earlier on Wednesday.The parliamentary authorities are understood to have given the area a deep clean and MPs were at the time sitting at least two metres apart. “This was done as a precaution,” a House of Commons source said.However, his suspected illness is likely to cause concern about the government’s decision to bring back parliament in its physical form, after weeks of allowing MPs to attend remotely via video link.Many MPs have protested against the new arrangements, which have resulted in them queueing around the parliamentary estate while complying with the two-metre physical distancing rules in order to vote.Observers noticed that Sharma appeared unwell and to be sweating profusely while he spoke about the corporate insolvency and governance bill in the Commons.A spokeswoman for the business secretary said: “Alok Sharma began feeling unwell when in the chamber delivering the second reading of the corporate governance and insolvency bill. In line with guidance he has been tested for coronavirus and is returning home to self-isolate.”If Sharma does test positive, it will be an early trial of the government’s new contact tracing system. Other MPs and officials who have been in close contact with him will be tested and could be asked to self-isolate.During the debate, after Sharma was seen wiping his face with a handkerchief several times, his Labour shadow, Ed Miliband, passed him a glass of water. Sharma also appeared sweaty and sounded hoarse on Tuesday, according to one fellow MP, when he voted to abolish hybrid parliamentary measures.During one vote, the minister voted straight after the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, and immediately before the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock. He was also one of a few ministers who attended full cabinet, a source said.In another vote on the substantive motion, Sharma queued to vote immediately after Saqib Bhatti, the Conservative MP for Meriden, and just before Paul Scully, the Tory MP for Sutton and Cheam.\u0026nbspLisa Nandy, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, said the development was “just awful”, adding: “The government stopped MPs from working from home and asked us to return to a building where social distancing is impossible. MPs are travelling home to every part of the country tonight. Reckless doesn’t even begin to describe it.”Digital voting in the Commons was ended on Tuesday after MPs approved a government motion introduced by the leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, despite widespread objections.Senior Conservatives, opposition groups, unions and the equalities watchdog raised concerns that the move would prevent many MPs, particularly the elderly and vulnerable members who are shielding, from being able to vote.Chaotic scenes unfolded in the Commons when MPs formed a long queue snaking through parliament so they could maintain social distancing while voting on the motion.The Labour MP Karl Turner said he had asked the Health and Safety Executive to conduct an urgent risk assessment of working conditions in parliament.He said MPs having to “huddle together” on escalators on the parliamentary estate while lining up to vote were among a number of “unsafe practices”.A string of cabinet ministers and senior officials have come down with coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, including Boris Johnson, who was treated in intensive care.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, Chris Whitty, the chief medical adviser, Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, Dominic Cummings, the senior No 10 adviser, and Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, were also all unwell with coronavirus in late March or early April.The first MP to fall ill with the virus was Nadine Dorries, a health minister, who tested positive in March.A House of Commons spokesperson said: “The house’s priority is to ensure that those on the estate are safe while business is facilitated. We have closely followed guidance from PHE on action to take following a suspected case of Covid on site, including additional cleaning. Our risk assessment outlines the measures we have already put in place to reduce the risk of transmission in parliament.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a31db3607995d764750f154f326864ecd803921b/0_142_4259_2555/master/4259.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66319c45a521815b3145f9b347c6b7fd","title":"coronavirus lockdown rules what is allowed in england scotland wales and northern ireland","story":"From socialising to sports, everything you need to know about the latest lockdown dos and don’tsThe latest coronavirus rules, from Monday 1 June, are plentiful and complicated. This is your ultimate guide.Q. Can I visit other people’s homes?You can spend time in private gardens or other outdoor spaces in groups of six from different households if you live in England or Northern Ireland – but you must adhere to 2-metre distancing. Those considered clinically extremely vulnerable can meet one person from outside their household if they live alone.Bring your own chairs and wipe them down carefully with household cleaner before and after use. You can go inside the property only for the purpose of accessing the garden or outdoor space.In Scotland, two households can meet outdoors, in groups no larger than eight, or visit close family in their gardens,\u0026nbspwith people urged to stay local and distance at all times. In Wales, two households can meet outdoors but should avoid travelling more than five miles.Q. Can I use the lavatory?Yes, but avoid touching surfaces, wash your hands thoroughly, wipe down surfaces and use separate towels, or paper ones.Q. Can I stay away from home?You cannot stay overnight away from your home except for in a limited set of circumstances, such as for work.Q. Should I wear a mask or visor and when?The UK government advises people to wear a face covering in enclosed spaces, such as on public transport and in shops, or anywhere that physical distancing is not always possible. The Scottish government has urged people to wear face coverings in all shops.While evidence suggests that wearing a face covering does not entirely protect you, it is likely to prevent others from becoming infected – especially important if you have not yet developed symptoms and are not self-isolating.Conversely, scientists say it is possible that visors protect the wearer but not those around them. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200601-73293-20200602_tif_DavidHunterRnumber.mp3 Q. Who should not wear a face covering?Face coverings should not be used by under-twos or those who may find it difficult to manage them correctly, such as unassisted primary-age children or those with respiratory conditions.Q. Does it matter what type of mask I wear?Different types of face covering offer different levels of protection, with surgical grade N95 respirators offering the highest, followed by surgical grade masks. However, these are costly, in limited supply and contribute to landfill waste. Even countries that have required the public to wear face masks have generally suggested surgical masks be reserved for health workers and those at high risk. You can make your own face covering, or use a scarf, shawl, or old T-shirt.Q. What shops can I visit?Essential outlets, which range from supermarkets to homeware shops, have remained open and car showrooms and outdoor markets opened on Monday in England.High street shops in the non-essential category will reopen in England from 15 June if the government’s five tests for coping with the virus are met, and provided that the shops are “Covid-secure”. Shops that expect to open from 15 June include those selling clothes, shoes, toys, furniture, books and electronics, plus tailors, auction houses, photography studios and indoor markets. Welsh high streets may open later than in England, while Scottish retailers will open on a phased basis, based on monitoring of the virus.Hairdressers, nail bars and beauty salons, cafes, pubs and other hospitality venues. While no dates have been given, the UK government has said they will reopen on a phased basis.Q. When can I get my hair cut and go to a pub?Ministers have an “ambition” to\u0026nbspopen at least some remaining businesses such as hairdressers and beauty salons, restaurants and pubs, but it will be no earlier than 4 July in England, and subject to the government’s five tests.Q. Who can go to work?Employers should make “every effort” to support working from home, according to the government in advice for England, but anyone who cannot do so is expected to return to work if it is safe.Q. What provisions are in place in workplaces?Government guidance emphasises that the risk of transmission can be lowered by reducing the number of people workers come into contact with and avoiding face-to-face meetings.Employers can support this by changing shift patterns and rotas, and splitting people into smaller, contained teams. Workers should avoid sharing equipment.Primary schools in England have been asked to bring back reception, year 1 and year 6 classes, as well as nursery children, from 1 June. In secondary schools, year 10 and 12 pupils are due to have some face-to-face time with teachers before the end of the summer term.The government’s “hope” is that all other primary children in England will return to school before the summer break. Secondary school pupils will not return before September.In Scotland,\u0026nbspteachers can return to prepare for\u0026nbspthe start of the new school year on 11 August,\u0026nbspwhen pupils will begin a “blended” model of at-home and in-school learning. Childminding services and fully outdoor nurseries are reopening while some councils are allowing older primary school pupils to begin the transition to secondary school.In Wales, all schools\u0026nbspwill reopen on June 29 with a four-week term ending on July 27 intended to give pupils, staff and parents time to prepare for a “new normal”. Some pupils in Northern Ireland will return to school in late August, with a phased return for the remainder.Amid concerns from unions and some parents, the UK government’s\u0026nbspguidance on reopening schools\u0026nbspstates that constant physical distancing of 2-metres is, in effect, impossible in schools.Its recommendations emphasise the importance of regular handwashing and cleaning of surfaces, and maintaining distance as much as possible, for example with different classroom layouts and staggered break times.\u0026nbspQ. How far can I travel?While people in England and Northern Ireland can travel as far as they want to take exercise and spend time outside, those in Wales are being asked to stay within five miles from their homes. Guidelines in Scotland require people to stay within five miles except when visiting close family.Q. When, where and how can I travel?Reduce demand on the public transport network by walking or cycling wherever possible, or driving, and by reducing trips. Use less busy routes where possible.Q. Can I share a car with someone else?Taxi services are operating, subject to advice such as passengers sitting in the back left-hand seat if travelling alone. Those who have to share private cars with people outside of their household group have been advised to keep to the same small groups.Q. Can I travel within the UK and go abroad?The UK government advises against all but essential travel abroad. People in England can now go as far as they want for exercise.Despite an easing of lockdowns around the UK, people are advised not to travel between Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland.Q. What sports can I do and where?Basketball and tennis courts, bowling greens and golf courses are open in England. Physical distancing must apply, with no more than five other people from outside one’s household allowed to take part.In Scotland, outdoor activities such as golf, bowls, tennis and fishing have restarted, with distancing caveats, while in Northern Ireland outdoor activities and sports including golf, water sports, tennis and those that don’t involve shared contact with hard surfaces are permitted.Outdoor gyms, playgrounds and outdoor and indoor swimming pools remain closed, though there are plans for pools to reopen, possibly without changing rooms.Q. Are professional sports people treated differently?Yes. Elite athletes, as defined by specific\u0026nbspguidance, can train and compete using specified gyms, pools and sports facilities. In Wales, only golfers and professional footballers have been allowed to play again.* Key workers and those needing access to childcare have not been subject to the same lockdown rules as others."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68b2cc3ee316f8a61e3df97b36954c1c6a20638c/0_0_4166_2500/master/4166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b28006d66b17b7d115d287e6ff3bc7cf","title":"covid 19 surgisphere who world health organization hydroxychloroquine","story":"Surgisphere, whose employees appear to include a sci-fi writer and adult content model, provided database behind Lancet and New England Journal of Medicine hydroxychloroquine studiesThe World Health Organization and a number of national governments have changed their Covid-19 policies and treatments on the basis of flawed data from a little-known US healthcare analytics company, also calling into question the integrity of key studies published in some of the world’s most prestigious medical journals.A  investigation can reveal the US-based company Surgisphere, whose handful of employees appear to include a science fiction writer and an adult-content model, has provided data for multiple studies on Covid-19 co-authored by its chief executive, but has so far failed to adequately explain its data or methodology.Data it claims to have legitimately obtained from more than a thousand hospitals worldwide formed the basis of scientific articles that have led to changes in Covid-19 treatment policies in Latin American countries. It was also behind a decision by the WHO and research institutes around the world to halt trials of the controversial drug hydroxychloroquine. On Wednesday, the WHO announced those trials would now resume.Two of the world’s leading medical journals – the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine – published studies based on Surgisphere data. The studies were co-authored by the firm’s chief executive, Sapan Desai.Late on Tuesday, after being approached by the , the Lancet released an “expression of concern” about its published study. The New England Journal of Medicine has also issued a similar notice.An independent audit of the provenance and validity of the data has now been commissioned by the authors not affiliated with Surgisphere because of “concerns that have been raised about the reliability of the database”.At a\u0026nbsppress conference on Wednesday, the WHO announced it\u0026nbspwould resume its global trial of hydroxychloroquine, after its data safety monitoring committee found there was no increased risk of death for Covid patients taking it.The WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that all parts of\u0026nbspthe Solidarity trial, which is investigating a number of potential drug treatments, would go ahead. So far, more than 3,500 patients have been recruited to the trial in 35 countries.“On the basis of the available mortality data, the members of the committee recommended that there are no reasons to modify the trial protocol,” said Tedros. “The executive group received this recommendation and endorsed continuation of all arms of the Solidarity trial, including hydroxychloroquine.”Questions surrounding Surgisphere have been growing in the medical community for the past few weeks.On 22 May the Lancet published a blockbuster peer-reviewed study which found the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, which has been promoted by Donald Trump, was associated with a higher mortality rate in Covid-19 patients and increased heart problems.Trump, much to the dismay of the scientific community, had publicly touted hydroxychloroquine as a “wonder drug” despite no evidence of its efficacy for treating Covid-19.The Lancet study, which listed Desai as one of the co-authors,\u0026nbspclaimed to have analysed Surgisphere data collected from nearly 96,000 patients with Covid-19, admitted to 671 hospitals from their database of 1,200 hospitals around the world, who received hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with antibiotics.The negative findings made global news and prompted the WHO to halt the hydroxychloroquine arm of its global trials.But only days later  Australia revealed glaring errors in the Australian data included in the study. The study said researchers gained access to data through Surgisphere from five hospitals, recording 600 Australian Covid-19 patients and 73 Australian deaths as of 21 April.But data from Johns Hopkins University shows only 67 deaths from Covid-19 had been recorded in Australia by 21 April. The number did not rise to 73 until 23 April.\u0026nbspDesai said one Asian hospital had accidentally been included in the Australian data, leading to an overestimate of cases there. The Lancet published a small retraction related to the Australian findings after the ’s story, its only amendment to the study so far. has since contacted five hospitals in Melbourne and two in Sydney, whose cooperation would have been essential for the Australian patient numbers in the database to be reached. All denied any role in such a database, and said they had never heard of Surgisphere. Desai did not respond to requests to comment on their statements. Another study using the Surgisphere database, again co-authored by Desai, found the anti-parasite drug ivermectin reduced death rates in severely ill Covid-19 patients. It was published online in the Social Science Research Network e-library, before peer-review or publication in a medical journal, and prompted the Peruvian government to add ivermectin to its national Covid-19 therapeutic guidelines.The New England Journal of Medicine  also published a peer-reviewed Desai study based on Surgisphere data, which included data from Covid-19 patients from 169 hospitals in 11 countries in Asia, Europe and North America. It found common heart medications known as angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers were not associated with a higher risk of harm in Covid-19 patients.On Wednesday, the NEJM and the Lancet published an expression of concern about the hydroxychloroquine study, which listed respected vascular surgeon Mandeep Mehra as the lead author and Desai as co-author.Lancet editor Richard Horton told the : “Given the questions raised about the reliability of the data gathered by Surgisphere, we have today issued an Expression of Concern, pending further investigation.“An independent data audit is currently underway and we trust that this review, which should be completed within the next week, will tell us more about the status of the findings reported in the paper by Mandeep Mehra and colleagues.”One of the questions that has most baffled the scientific community is how Surgisphere, established by Desai in 2008 as a medical education company that published textbooks, became the owner of a powerful international database. That database, despite only being announced by Surgisphere recently, boasts access to data from 96,000 patients in 1,200 hospitals around the world.When contacted by the , Desai said his company employed just 11 people. The employees listed on LinkedIn were recorded on the site as having joined Surgisphere only two months ago. Several did not appear to have a scientific or statistical background, but mention expertise in strategy, copywriting, leadership and acquisition. Dr James Todaro, who runs MedicineUncensored, a website that publishes the results of hydroxychloroquine studies, said: “Surgisphere came out of nowhere to conduct perhaps the most influential global study in this pandemic in the matter of a few weeks.Desai told the : “Surgisphere has been in business since 2008. Our healthcare data analytics services started about the same time and have continued to grow since that time. We use a great deal of artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate this process as much as possible, which is the only way a task like this is even possible.” It is not clear from the methodology in the studies that used Surgisphere data, or from the Surgisphere website itself, how the company was able to put in place data-sharing agreements from so many hospitals worldwide, including those with limited technology, and to reconcile different languages and coding systems, all while staying within the regulatory, data-protection and ethical rules of each country.Desai said Surgisphere and its QuartzClinical content management system was part of a research collaboration initiated “several years ago”, though he did not specify when.“Surgisphere serves as a data aggregator and performs data analysis on this data,” he said. “We are not responsible for the source data, thus the labor intensive task required for exporting the data from an Electronic Health Records, converting it into the format required by our data dictionary, and fully deidentifying the data is done by the healthcare partner.”This appears to contradict the claim on the QuartzClinical website that it does all the work, and “successfully integrates your electronic health record, financial system, supply chain, and quality programs into one platform”. Desai did not explain this apparent contradiction when the  put it to him.Desai said the way Surgisphere obtained data was “always done in compliance with local laws and regulations. We never receive any protected health information or inidually identifiable information.”Peter Ellis, the chief data scientist of Nous Group, an international management consultancy that does data integration projects for government departments, expressed concern that Surgisphere database was “almost certainly a scam”.“It is not something that any hospital could realistically do,” he said. “De-identifying is not just a matter of knocking off the patients’ names, it is a big and difficult process. I doubt hospitals even have capability to do it appropriately. It is the sort of thing national statistics agencies have whole teams working on, for years.”None of the information from Desai’s database has yet been made public, including the names of any of the hospitals, despite the Lancet being among the many signatories\u0026nbspto a statement on data-sharing for Covid-19 studies. The Lancet study is now disputed by 120 doctors.When the  put a detailed list of concerns to Desai about the database, the study findings and his background, he responded: “There continues to be a fundamental misunderstanding about what our system is and how it works”.“There are also a number of inaccuracies and unrelated connections that you are trying to make with a clear bias toward attempting to discredit who we are and what we do,” he said. “We do not agree with your premise or the nature of what you have put together, and I am sad to see that what should have been a scientific discussion has been denigrated into this sort of discussion.”An examination of Desai’s background found that the vascular surgeon has been named in three medical malpractice suits in the US, two of them filed in November 2019. In one case, a lawsuit filed by a patient, Joseph Vitagliano, accused Desai and Northwest Community Hospital in Illinois, where he worked until recently, of being “careless and negligent”, leading to permanent damage following surgery.\u0026nbspNorthwest Community Hospital confirmed that Desai had been employed there since June 2016 but had voluntarily resigned on 10 February 2020 “for personal reasons”.“Dr Desai’s clinical privileges with NCH were not suspended, revoked or otherwise limited by NCH,” a spokeswoman said. The hospital declined to comment on the malpractice suits. Desai said in the interview with the Scientist that he deemed any lawsuit against him to be “unfounded”.Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the institution affiliated with the hydroxychloroquine study and its lead author, Mandeep Mehra, said in a statement: “Independent of Surgisphere, the remaining co-authors of the recent studies published in The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine have initiated independent reviews of the data used in both papers after learning of the concerns that have been raised about the reliability of the database”.\u0026nbspMehra said he had routinely underscored the importance and value of randomised, clinical trials and that such trials were necessary before any conclusions could be reached. “I eagerly await word from the independent audits, the results of which will inform any further action,” he said.Desai’s now-deleted Wikipedia page said he held a doctorate in law and a PhD in anatomy and cell biology, as well as his medical qualifications. A biography of Desai on a brochure for an international medical conference says he has held multiple physician leadership roles in clinical practice, and that he is “a certified lean six sigma master black belt”. It is not the first time Desai has launched projects with ambitious claims. In 2008, he launched a crowdfunding campaign on the website indiegogo promoting a “next generation human augmentation device” called Neurodynamics Flow, which he said “can help you achieve what you never thought was possible”.“With its sophisticated programming, optimal neural induction points, and tried and true results, Neurodynamics Flow allows you to rise to the peak of human evolution,” the description said. The device raised a few hundred dollars, and never eventuated.Ellis, the chief data scientist of Nous Group, said it was unclear why Desai made such bold claims about his products given how likely it was that the global research community would scrutinise them.“My first reaction is it was to draw attention to his firm, Ellis said. “But it seems really obvious that this would backfire.” Today Prof Peter Horby, Professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases and Global Health in the Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, said: “I welcome the statement from the\u0026nbspLancet, which follows a similar statement by the\u0026nbspNEJM\u0026nbspregarding a study by the same group on cardiovascular drugs and COVID-19.\u0026nbsp“The very serious concerns being raised about the validity of the papers by Mehra et al need to be recognised and actioned urgently, and ought to bring about serious reflection on whether the quality of editorial and peer review during the pandemic has been adequate.\u0026nbspScientific publication must above all be rigorous and honest.\u0026nbspIn an emergency, these values are needed more than ever.”• This story was amended on 4 June 2020 to correct the number of patients in the Lancet study, originally reported as 15,000 rather than 96,000."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db7f66649f4b9bf768c514ee3900edcc848d7950/0_317_4784_2872/master/4784.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c48121ae8df55db9022a0045761ba7ce","title":"hydroxychloroquine no better than placebo study finds","story":"Trial suggests drug does not protect those exposed to virus from becoming infectedTaking hydroxychloroquine does not protect people who have been close to someone with coronavirus from becoming infected, a study suggests.Donald Trump told the world he was taking one pill a day to safeguard himself against the coronavirus, on the advice of his doctor. However, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests the drug is no more effective in protecting people exposed to the virus than a placebo.The trial, which was carried out in the USand Canada, recruited people who were at moderate to high risk of contracting Covid-19. Most of them were deemed at high risk because they had been closer than 2 metres from somebody with the virus for more than 10 minutes without wearing any personal protective equipment. The hope was that the drug could be used to protect people where somebody in their family was infected.This was a randomised, controlled trial – the so-called “gold standard” – and was set up to compare what happened in people given hydroxychloroquine within four days of exposure and those given dummy pills instead.The researchers enrolled 821 mostly younger and healthy adults with an average age of 40 who had no symptoms at the time. Within four days of exposure, each received a delivery from a courier of a package containing either placebo or hydroxychloroquine. The pills were\u0026nbspto be taken over five days, starting with a stronger dose on day\u0026nbspone.About one in eight (107 out of 821) of the participants developed Covid-19 over the 14-day follow-up period. Both confirmed cases and probable cases – those not tested but judged on symptoms – were included in the study owing to some lack of availability of diagnostic testing in the US.Among those who received hydroxychloroquine, 49 developed Covid-19 (or compatible symptoms such as fever or cough), compared with\u0026nbsp58 in the group that received the placebo. The difference is not considered to be significant. Two patients had to treated in hospital, one in each group and there were no deaths.“While we had\u0026nbsphope\u0026nbspthis drug would work\u0026nbspin this context,\u0026nbspour study\u0026nbspdemonstrates that\u0026nbsphydroxychloroquine is no better than\u0026nbspplacebo\u0026nbspwhen used as post-exposure prophylaxis within four days of exposure\u0026nbspto someone infected with the new coronavirus,”\u0026nbspsaid Dr Todd Lee, an associate professor of medicine, ision of infectious diseases at McGill University in Canada and one of the lead authors of the study.“Our study’s results set politics aside and provide unbiased evidence to guide practice in the prevention of Covid-19 and reinforce the importance of randomised clinical trials as we work together nationally and internationally to combat the novel coronavirus,’’ said Dr Ryan Zarychanski, an associate professor of internal medicine at the University of Manitoba, Canada.Other trials taking place will show whether there is a place for the drug in preventing infections in other settings.

Opening the WHO’s regular coronavirus briefing, he added: “For several weeks the number of cases reported each day in the Americas has been more than the rest of the world put together. We are especially worried about Central and South America, where many countries are witnessing accelerating epidemics. We also see increasing numbers of cases in the eastern Mediterranean, south-east Asia and Africa, although the numbers are much smaller.”Brazil registered a record number of daily deaths from the novel coronavirus for a second consecutive day, according to health ministry data released on Wednesday, even as city and state authorities moved aggressively to open commerce back up. There were 1,349 new coronavirus deaths and 28,633 additional confirmed cases, the data showed, meaning Brazil had registered 32,548 deaths and 584,016 total confirmed cases. Its rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro, has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the virus, saying on Tuesday that death was “everyone’s destiny”.Mexican health authorities reported 1,092 coronavirus deaths on Wednesday, the highest toll in one day so far, with total infections surging past 100,000. The number of deaths was more than twice a previous record and daily infections were also at an all-time high of 3,912. The additions bring the total number of known cases to 101,238 and deaths to 11,729. Health authorities have previously said the real number is higher.The Minneapolis man who died with a policeman’s knee on his neck tested positive for coronavirus, according to a full autopsy report released by the Hennepin county medical examiner’s office. The report noted that the virus was not a contributing factor in his death and that Floyd had no symptoms. KSTP news reported: “A postmortem nasal swab was taken, which confirmed that Floyd was positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. It is noted that Floyd was known to be positive for Covid-19 on April 3. The postmortem positivity likely reflects asymptomatic but persistent PCR positivity from previous infection.”The number of coronavirus cases in California is on the rise after weeks of optimism that infections had slowed, raising fears that plans to reopen counties, along with mass protests against police brutality, could accelerate transmission. According to numbers from Johns Hopkins University, California is\u0026nbspone of 20 states\u0026nbspthat have seen an increase in cases in the past five days.The coronavirus outbreak could trigger a $25tn (£20tn) collapse in the fossil fuel industry by accelerating a terminal decline for the world’s most polluting companies. A study has found that the value of the world’s fossil fuel reserves could fall by two-thirds, sooner than the industry expects, because\u0026nbspthe Covid-19 crisis has hastened the peak for oil, gas and coal demand.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireDublin city shops will have to enforce a strict on-street queuing regime if they are to reopen their doors on Monday.Shop owners must ensure customers do not queue past the length of their shop front, and will be required to “take measures to prevent members of the public joining the queue” if it breaches this length, under strict protocols issued by Dublin City Council.The council’s Covid-19 queuing rules are designed to prevent overcrowding on the city’s shopping streets, particularly pedestrianised areas such as Henry Street and Grafton Street, and the small streets that surround them, where shops are densely positioned.However, the rules, coupled with two-metre distancing requirements, would mean that most shops could not have more than two or three customers waiting outside.Queues will be required to run along the shop front, and not perpendicular to it, as would be typically seen with cash machine queues on Grafton Street and Henry Street.The queue must not extend beyond the length of the shopfront, but also must not begin immediately at the entrance door or run in front of a fire escape.Queues to different premises must not overlap, but physical barriers must not be used to control or manage queues.The council will be placing “queueing icons” on the ground in the main pedestrianised streets in the city centre and O’Connell Street, but retailers can also mark the footpath with removable stickers to indicate the direction of the queue and appropriate spacing.Not blockedThe onus has been put on shops to ensure the queueing rules are adhered to, with the guidelines stating that “care should be taken by the retailer to ensure that appropriate social distancing is being observed” and that pavements are not blocked, particularly for those with visual or mobility impairments.The protocols also state: “Where the available pavement space is insufficient to accommodate queuing demand, the retailer must take measures to prevent members of the public joining the queue.”The council advises that retailers should consider operating on an “appointment-only basis” if possible.Despite the onerous responsibilities placed on retailers, business groups have largely welcomed the council’s guidelines.Graeme McQueen of Dublin Chamber of Commerce said they were “a useful starting point for firms as they ramp up their reopening plans” and said the chamber would be meeting with council chief executive Owen Keegan in the coming days to “further the dialogue” between businesses and the council. “By working together, and with a common sense approach, a successful reopening of Dublin can happen that works for all parties. Dublin Chamber is liaising with members currently regarding their reopening plans and feeding any issues back to Dublin City Council and the other local authorities in Dublin.”SafetySmall Firms Association senior executive Elizabeth Bowen said safety of staff and customers would be retailers’ “top priority” as they reopened.“Retailers and local authorities need to work together to determine how to manage this process and I would welcome this guidance from the council.”Many shops, particularly smaller retailers, were likely to focus on an appointment-only system for their initial reopening, she said.“We would be very aware that in Dublin city the retail spaces can be quite small and queuing, particularly with the guidelines in mind, would be almost impossible. So I think a lot of retailers will use an online booking system, or if queues do form, will take customers numbers and call them or use an automated text system to tell them when there is space to come back.”The reopening of shops would be “a learning process”, she said, and shops were already learning from their neighbours such as pharmacies and supermarkets which had remained open.Business organisation Dublin Town said it had circulated the queuing protocols to its members and believed they represented a “sensible, balanced approach”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Unthinkable: Is nature\u0026rsquos mother god sending us a message with Covid-19?Q\u0026ampA: What you need to know as the State faces its second hosepipe ban in two yearsNew motor trade lobby group wants to delay ban on diesel and petrol engines until 2040"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteriaAs top marine predators, dolphins accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutants"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4270153.1591220549!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what ireland s exceptional drought means for our water supply","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe State is facing a second hosepipe ban in the space of  two years. File photograph: Gareth FullerPA A second hosepipe ban in two years is likely, why is this happening?It is hard to reconcile that vast tracts of the country were subjected to extreme flooding in late January and early February while four months later we are facing a likely hosepipe ban for the coming summer – the second such ban in two years.Such extremes, however, are exactly what is predicted for Ireland in a world which month after month is seeing record temperatures due to carbon emissions derived from human activity. A combination of prolonged flooding episodes in winter and more frequent (and longer) summer heatwaves are forecast for the country, as well as extreme weather events in the form of storms that are more intense.At this point, we are in the midst of a prolonged drought, with nothing in mid-range weather forecasts to suggest it will end soon. Once again, it has exposed the country’s vulnerability due to cavalier attitudes among consumers about the need for water conservation and poor “resilience” in the water supply system – a problem that is most acute in the greater Dublin region.The Dublin region has had its driest spring since 1837, at a time when the need for extra hygiene to combat Covid-19 has resulted in a 20 per cent greater demand for water. What’s more, according to analysis by Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units (Icarus) in Maynooth University, drought conditions now are more extreme – and earlier in the year – compared with 2018. “Truly remarkable is the fact that combined rainfall totals for April and May 2020 rank as the driest consecutive two months ever recorded at Phoenix Park, the longest running continuous series in the Republic,” it notes in its latest monitoring blog.Prof Fiona Regan of DCU Water Institute has been tracking water levels since mid-March they are now 10 times lower than over the previous five years. Typically, water availability in Dublin and the eastern region has been on average just 1 per cent above demand.There is every likelihood the extent of drought and water shortages is being exacerbated by climate disruption driven by CO2 emissions – though heatwaves can be a feature of natural weather patterns.How can a country with plenty of rain end up having to restrict water usage?The State’s water supply issues are twofold. The first issue is poor water-supply infrastructure, as indicated by high levels of leakage concentrated in the area of biggest demand: the Dublin region. The capacity to maintain supplies in the capital is on a knife-edge, with an overreliance on water taken from the river Liffey. Latest indications suggest that 45 per cent of Dublin’s water is lost due to leaks.“There has also been a disappointing drop-off in the number of leak repairs completed under the First Fix Scheme from mid-2016,” the Government’s Water Advisory Body warned earlier this year. “By any measure, Ireland’s leakage rate is unacceptable,” it added.The second issue evident across the country is lack of routine water conservation, reuse and recycling while water remains free for householders. Evidence has shown the lack of a water charge leads to overuse, and our current regime in this regard puts us at odds with most modern economies.What are the risks from prolonged water shortages?Due to the threat from coronavirus, water is critical to reducing spread of the virus washing your hands is a key preventative action – and will continue to be so, inevitably increasing demand for water. The threat, however, goes much further. Extended dry weather amid continued demand will result in lower water levels in rivers and lakes which are the source of public drinking-water supply for more than 80 per cent of the Irish population, the Water Forum notes. Lower water levels mean there is less water to dilute pollutants, so discharges to rivers and lakes will be able to cause deterioration in water quality, with resulting impact on flora and fauna. Low water levels impact on “recharge rates” for groundwater sources and this can impact on water supply to small private supplies. Water shortages also mean more water is taken from rivers to irrigate land, putting further pressure on drinking supplies.How are the State’s water supply issues going to be solved?Irish Water is currently preparing a National Water Resources Plan that aims to ensure a sustainable, secure and reliable water supply for the next 25 years. This will assess the amount of water available in our rivers, lakes and groundwater systems and calculate the demand from businesses and homes. It will also factor in the impact of climate change on the geographic distribution of water resources. Piping water from the Shannon river south of Lough Derg will be the utility’s key action towards solving Dublin’s supply difficulties, though that is likely to cost in excess of €1.6 billion and won’t solve the city’s leakage problem. Irish Water has an extensive programme of repairing leaking pipes, though cost factors and disruptions in busy urban areas mean it’s a far from straightforward task. Those favouring more aggressive efforts to tackle leakage point to less disruptive and more technologically advanced options now available for use in big cities.Conservation has to be part of the mix – a national conversation on this is long overdue.What is the immediate outlook from here?It is important to note this drought is ongoing. The numbers are exceptional to date and large soil moisture deficits exist, Icarus notes. There are obvious implications for agricultural production, especially in the form of likely fodder shortages.It will take a considerable amount of rain to bring this drought event to an end. Continued dry conditions will make the 2020 drought an even more remarkable event than in 2018, when the first water conservation order (hosepipe ban) was introduced. While forecasts for the coming weeks show some chance of rain, the totals for now look to be small. The longer-term seasonal forecasts for this summer, while uncertain, suggest a drier and hotter summer than average over western Europe, Icarus predicts. While the drought of 2020 is more limited in spatial scale so far, affecting the east most intensely, the unfolding situation needs to be carefully monitored. Unlike in 2018, we now find ourselves in the midst of a global pandemic where water has taken on a new public health importance and created new vulnerabilities.Longer term, the Irish climate is projected to warm across all seasons, with every indication that living with regular hosepipe bans will be an inevitable consequence."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

The closing date for nominations is next Sunday, June 7th, at 11pm. A potential candidate must receive the support of 50 members before to be eligible.As of now it is certain that deputy leader Catherine Martin has received sufficient nominations – she will have upwards of 150. Party leader Eamon Ryan will also have no difficulty reaching the threshold from among the 3,000 members.However, while the nominations close on Sunday night, the rules are silent on declarations. Therefore no potential candidates will be required to declare this weekend.Party officials will use this lacuna as a device to separate the leadership contest from the ongoing programme for government negotiations over fears of what one source described as “cross-contamination”.In effect, it will allow the party to put a stay on any potential leadership contest until July.ThresholdPotential candidates will be informed early next week if they have reached the required threshold. The expectation is they will be Mr Ryan and Ms Martin.The  understands from a reliable source who is a supporter of\u0026nbspthe deputy leader that Ms Martin will likely decide to declare her candidacy given the volume of nominations she has received. However,\u0026nbspnot immediately.“The leadership contest will be decided on policy, on the direction of the party, about who is best at communicating its message, and if the party could perform better under a new leader.”The source claimed while Mr Ryan had very strong support within parliament, Ms Martin could claim stronger rank-and-file backing.Among the party’s wider membership, those who support or oppose a leadership contest are roughly ided along the lines of who is in favour of government negotiations and who is opposed.Younger and more left-leaning members of the party tend to favour a contest. Those in favour of going into government tend to see the contest as an unhelpful distraction that will weaken the party’s hand.“I am a complete outlier,” said one councillor. “I am a really strong supporter of Eamon Ryan as leader, but I am opposed to the Greens going into government.”InopportuneAnother member who favours the party going into government said: “The timing is inopportune. The constitution says that this is when we should have the contest, but I thought it should have been deferred.“I am pleasantly surprised it does not seem to be as isive as I am reading in the media. Perhaps we should just vote and see who wins and move on from there.”A Dublin-based member opposed to going into government said it was good for the party to have a debate on its direction, saying it would be a “respectful contest” not a “bloodbath”.If the contest goes ahead after negotiations conclude there will have to be remote hustings and a postal ballot.The party has decided ballots have to be in by July 22nd, with the count on July 23rd.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsIndependent TDs have been offered deals similar to that given to former Kerry Independent Jackie Healy-Rae to support a coalition between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party.The offer was made at a meeting between Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan and Independents.The meeting was attended by TDs Marian Harkin, Michael Fitzmaurice and Michael McNamara. A separate meeting with the nine-strong Regional Group of Independents is due to take place on Thursday.Mr Varadkar said the deals would be similar to those offered to Mr Healy Rae and Mildred Fox, a former Wicklow Independent, by Bertie Ahern in the past.Such an arrangement would involve local deals for inidual TDs as well as access to government ministers. The Taoiseach is understood to have said the Fine Gael-Independent minority government operated similar deals.The Independents were told they would be given a programme for government when it was agreed, and they were left with the impression that they would be supporting an administration from outside. It is understood that no ministerial posts or committee chairs were offered.Crucial junctureThe offer from the three party leaders comes at a crucial juncture in the negotiations on a programme for government. One source said that the “mood has soured in the last week”, while another source, from another party, acknowledged that “a bit of gloom has descended over the whole thing”. However, sessions on finance and transport were said to be more positive on Wednesday.Sources still say a deal is possible, but achieving the Greens’ demands of a 7 per cent annual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is still a significant problem in the talks.Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have particular problems with proposed reductions in the agriculture sector, where some Green proposals are “undeliverable”, sources in both parties say.The Greens have made clear that the 7 per cent reduction is a red line for the party, and they must have credible paths to achieve it if they are to sign up for a deal.One of the other issues is a demand that 20 per cent of transport infrastructure budgets be spent on walking and cycling. This would be in addition to a Green demand that all transport spending be split on a 2:1 basis in favour of public transport over roads.However, there is optimism that differences on the public finances can be resolved, despite differing views within the parties.One senior figure in Fianna Fáil warned that the country would face a “full-blown political crisis” if there was no agreement on a programme for government next week, while a senior Fine Gael source acknowledged there is a belief in the party that it could benefit from another general election.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4270139.1591219882!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord michael ring came to praise his department not bury it","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Ring: ‘Whoever comes into government, I will see it as a slight on rural Ireland if the Department of Rural and Community Development is not left there.’ Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill The last few months have been tough on Michael Ring. So many removals and Masses he has been unable to attend. So many hands not shaken, so many sympathies left unsaid.The consummate constituency man has been furloughed from funerals by Covid-19 and he’s not himself. The TD for Mayo and Minister for Rural and Community Development came to the Dáil on Wednesday afternoon to make a statement on his department’s handling of the crisis and answer questions about it. As the session progressed, it began to feel like the Dáil’s most celebrated send-off specialist (for there are many) was presiding at the obsequies for his own ministerial job and beloved Government department. He recalled the new department’s difficult birth. Some TDs tried to stop it but he managed to deliver the Bill establishing it at a Dáil sitting which ran close to its midnight deadline.“I’ll say this and I’ll say this openly and honestly – we have the finest department,” he Trumpily declared. There is talk of a shake-up of departments after the new government is formed with Ringo’s pride and joy figuring among those mentioned as suitable for integration with other ministries. And there has also been talk that he won’t be included in a much reduced Fine Gael coalition cabinet team. This was clearly playing on his mind. During an uncharacteristically subdued performance, the Minister became animated when strongly hinting he will not be back in any new administration. “I want to put this on the record – and I shouldn’t, but I will. Whoever comes into government, I will see it as a slight on rural Ireland if the Department of Rural and Community Development is not left there. And I don’t care who goes into government, that department has to be left there,” he passionately declared. Add to that the sudden, cruel removal of his long-established right to roam the parishes of Mayo condoling with constituents in a manner perfected over the years and you can see why the normally ebullient Ringo was a bit out of sorts. There was a valedictory sense to the proceedings. While ministers always go over the top lauding the wonderful works wrought by their special corner of government, Michael’s opening contribution had a touch of eulogy about it. He managed to mention “my department” 16 times. It sounded like he was trying to send a last-ditch message to save the department he brought into the world while laying claim to be the person best qualified to run it. From the beginning of the crisis, his department has played a central role in mitigating the Covid-19 threat and before that it was chalking up countless achievements in rural communities and disbursing bucketloads of funds around every far-flung corner and up every boreen, he modestly pointed out in great detail.And the TDs present were generous and sincere in acknowledging the work he has done and thanking him for it. Travel limitsWith an eye to the particular needs of people living in rural areas, the Minister has been critical of the strict travel limits imposed during the lockdown. There are reports of tension within Cabinet between Ministers who want the restrictions eased (Ring firmly in that camp) and those who want to stick with the expert advice. He took the opportunity to publicly express those views when Labour’s Sean Sherlock said the restrictions were unfair to rural communities. “I can’t disagree with you . . .There is a difference between 5km in an urban area and a rural area.” That statement shouldn’t have made sense, except it did. People in urban Ireland don’t have to go very far to access services and amenities, but it’s a different story for those living in less densely populated areas of the country. But then “lookit” sighed the funereally deprived TD, the whole lockdown has been very hard going. “There is no point in pretending and I don’t mind saying it in this Dáil myself today that I found it difficult myself, when you’re, you know . . .” He gathered himself. “What I miss most is actually meeting people, talking to people. And it’s, it’s very difficult when you’re all your life . . .” he looked up sadly towards fellow flesh-presser Bernard Durkan, who was in the chair. “Sorry, you know that Cathaoirleach, as somebody that’s going around talking to people, meeting people and the next thing, all of a sudden, that all stops.”You had to feel for him.Michael’s mood wasn’t helped by negative comments from some TDs. He pointed across to Sinn Féin’s Pauline Tully. “And I heard you criticising the funding that Cavan got. Well Cavan got more funding from the last government, and I’ll put it on the record now . . . Go back and check the record,” he told her. “You’ve got substantial funding in the towns and villages, I remember off the top of me head, and I wasn’t expecting to get parochial today but because you raised it, I will.” Perish the thought.Thanks to colleagues Frankie Feighan and Peter Burke, who obligingly kept their questions very short and glowingly complimentary, Ringo was allowed more time to talk about his department. He was delighted to hear some positive comments for a change. “It does annoy me sometimes when I hear people knocking rural Ireland,” he sighed, also expressing his irritation with those who are “not truthful” about the government funding they receive for their communities.“People have short memories.” And to think his bailiwick might be at risk. “Let nobody tell me that rural Ireland isn’t a better place since this department was set up,” quivered the Mouth of Mayo. It has done a “tremendous job” in all sorts of areas, including “the broadband”. It’s been success all the way. “There’s more people working and living in rural Ireland now then there ever has been since the foundation of the State. Not me saying it, not the Government saying it, that’s the CSO figures.”Ringo’s operation is so good that other departments offload difficult issues on to Community and Rural Development. “I don’t mind them throwing over the issues, but they never throw over the funding,” sniffed the Minister, feeling a bit sorry for himself and his predicament.Michael Healy-Rae was very supportive, thanking him for his particular interest in local improvement schemes. “You delivered every penny that you could, you certainly weren’t found wanting when it came to County Kerry.”At this rate we’ll have to set up a petition to have Michael Ring returned to cabinet. “I’d love to be here myself,” he said, hopefully."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Storm made landfall further south than expected giving some respite to metropolis ravaged by coronavirusDeath at Wuhan\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquowhistleblower hospital\u0026rsquo prompts wave of anger at hospital authoritiesSchools in deprived areas reported girls using newspapers and rags in attempt to manage periodAnnual vigil to mark Tiananmen Square massacre cancelled but activists still plan to rallyOfficials and media say US criticism of Hong Kong policing illustrates double standardsExperts fear country\u0026rsquos caseload could reach 1m in several weeks if virus is not curbedBejing approved decision to create laws for Hong Kong to curb sedition, secession, terrorismMove paves way for anti-sedition laws which rights advocates say will threaten city\u0026rsquos freedomsAt least 69 cases this week linked to cluster of infections at logistics facilityThousands take to streets to oppose Beijing-backed laws curtailing city\u0026rsquos freedomsMove to impose security law illustrates Beijing\u0026rsquos increasing tendency to flex its muscleProtesters get ready for more demonstrations against proposed Beijing lawsCommissioner in territory says contentious new security law aimed at \u0026lsquotroublemakers\u0026rsquoPM has made most of her communication skills and the country\u0026rsquos political cultureCian English (19), from Carlow, died following fall from Gold Coast apartmentChina proposes path to imposing rules used against dissidents on the mainlandPolice fire tear gas in popular shopping district as protesters take to the streets\u0026lsquoThere is a political virus spreading in United States,\u0026rsquo says China\u0026rsquos foreign ministerWinds gusting up to 210kmh expected near iron ore producing heartland of the PilbaraInvestigation begins into cause of Pakistan International Airlines crash that killed 97Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4270113.1591215700!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why facebook wants the eu to decide the limits of free speech","story":"Different approaches taken by two of the biggest social media giants in recent days have highlighted the high stakes of managing problematic online content.As protests against the killing of black people by police swept the United States, president Donald Trump wrote on Twitter and Facebook “Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts”.In a first in its dealings with the US president, Twitter obscured the post with a warning label, saying it violated its rules against glorifying violence.But Facebook took a different approach, leaving the president’s post as it was. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said that while he found the post “deeply offensive”, it did not violate his company’s policies.Both companies have faced consequences.\u0026nbspTwitter has been the focus of a backlash from Trump, who threatened to “strongly regulate” social media companies or “close them down”. For Facebook, the heat came from employees who openly criticised the company’s inaction. Two of them publicly quit.What kind of posts should not be allowed on social media, who should make those decisions, and how, is a regulatory puzzle. And Zuckerberg has asked the European Commission to solve it.In a public discussion with internal market commissioner Thierry Breton last month, the Facebook boss asked the commission to set rules for social media companies to follow. “Basically, the platforms shouldn’t be left to govern themselves,” Zuckerberg said. Europe had the opportunity to set a standard for the world, he argued, and should do so before China did.It might seem a strange position for Zuckerberg to take, but it makes sense.Such platforms are too big and too famous to host harmful speech without damage to their reputations. If there are to be rules, it’s easier for Facebook to follow one set of them for all of the EU rather than differing laws in each country. And it’s easier if the company does not have to do the expensive and difficult work of solving the riddle itself.Currently, internet companies are not liable for content that is published on their platforms. But once notified of illegal content, they must act.Monitoring content is a minefield. Both humans and artificial intelligence are bad at it in different ways.Text is one thing: it can be scanned for problematic key words. Video is rich in information and time-consuming to monitor. One clip could contain multiple languages, fuzzy outlines, and key information only a person familiar with the context would pick up on. That’s why China’s persecuted Uighur minority use TikTok to find out about crackdowns, because censors can’t keep up.Once online networks have a copy of a problematic video they automatically scan for the same clip and remove it. Once known to the system, the same videos are prevented from being published again. Hollywood films don’t appear on YouTube, because such copyrighted content is scanned for and removed.Mass shootingsBut there’s no pre-emptive scanning, so deeply disturbing content such as videos of mass shootings have been broadcast live on Facebook.Then there’s the question of how to manage communication on private messaging app WhatsApp, which has been a major source of misinformation on Covid-19 all over the world. Messages on it are private and encrypted, so there is no oversight.The European Commission views problematic speech online as fitting into roughly three categories. The first is terrorist communication, which is clearly illegal. Then there is hate speech, for which different member states have different national laws. The third covers false information and foreign interference, and it is the most difficult to deal with, as it is fraught with subjectivity and trade-offs with freedom of speech.The harm that misinformation can cause has become clear during the coronavirus pandemic, as poisoning incidents spike across the world due to the promotion of false cures.But the dangers of regulating this kind of speech has also been made clear by the case of Hungary. There, the authoritarian government of Viktor Orban created sweeping new powers in response to the pandemic that included penalties of several years in prison for people who publish untrue or distorted facts. This has led to police raids on iniduals who criticised the government on Facebook.The EU this week launched a public consultation to gather information on how it should update its 20-year-old regulation of internet services, the e-Commerce Directive, in a new Digital Services Act. The topics on the table are enormous, ranging from how to manage illegal activity on the internet to dealing with online monopolies.When it comes to judging acceptable online content, the commission is likely to address only what is illegal, and steer clear of any matters that edge towards the sticky overlaps with freedom of speech.Ultimately it may pass the buck back to the social media companies. “They have an interest in keeping their house in order because they have an interest in remaining an attractive place for information sharing,” one official said. “We cannot solve all the problems.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"War and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayAccident in which 15 wounded takes place during training exercise in Gulf of OmanFormation of coalition to proceed after supreme court clears way for PM to remain in officePolitics and ision facilitate virus in country with just 208 ventilators and scant testingPresident fears country\u0026rsquos 44 cases and three deaths could \u0026lsquosuddenly spike in few days or weeks\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states.

The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role.

We believe the car was still in Portugal and would like information if you saw it.”Both of the vehicles were tracked down and seized by German police, where they remain now in an evidence pound.Two mobile phone numbers were also unearthed by police which could prove central to the case.The first number is +351 912 730 680. Extensive enquiries led investigators to believe the suspect was using this number and received a call, starting at 7.32pm and finishing at 8.02pm on 3 May 2007. The call was received in the area of Praia da Luz.The number that made the call is +351 916 510 683. Whoever called the suspect was not in the area of Praia but could provide information pivotal to the investigation.Madeleine was reported missing from the Ocean Club resort at 10.14pm that night.Detectives have described the caller as “a highly significant witness” and have appealed to them to get in touch.They have also asked people to check their phones, old phones and contacts books to see if they have ever made a call to the numbers or received one from them.The police also established that until a year before Madeleine went missing, the suspect was living in a white-painted bungalow around two miles from the Ocean Club with a girlfriend.Neighbours have said the property was run-down at the time, and littered with old cars which the suspect bought and sold.One, who helped clear out the rented property for new occupants, said she found bags of wigs and exotic clothing inside.The identification of the blond-haired suspect comes seven years after Scotland Yard said it was eager to trace a blond-haired man who had been seen loitering in the area on April 30 and May 2. He was described as “ugly” with a spotty complexion and a large nose.Two blond-haired men were seen on the balcony of an empty apartment two doors from the McCanns’ at 2.30pm on the day of the disappearance. Blond men were seen again near the apartment at 4pm and 6pm that day, and at 11pm that night.On Wednesday night German police broadcast a televised appeal for new information about the suspect, who is currently in prison for an unrelated matter.DCI Cranwell said: “There may be people in the past who would be quite fearful of coming forward to the police, and my message to anybody that has information is, did he speak to you in confidence and tell you what happened that night?“He is currently in prison and this might be a good time to come forward and talk to the police.”A £20,000 reward remains on the table for information leading to the conviction of the person responsible for Madeleine\u0027s disappearance.The Met\u0027s £12 million investigation has identified more than 600 people as being potentially significant but the German — who was already known to police — is the first to be named by them as a suspect.German police are treating Madeleine’s disappearance as a murder investigation but Operation Grange, launched in 2013, has always considered the case a missing person inquiry.The identification of the new suspect marks the biggest development in years in what has been one of the most high-profile — and so far fruitless — missing persons investigations in British criminal history.Madeleine, who vanished shortly before her fourth birthday and would have turned 17 last month, had been left to sleep with her twin siblings Sean and Amelie in the family’s holiday apartment at the Ocean Club as the family dined at a tapas restaurant on the other side of a swimming pool.Nothing was amiss when Mr McCann checked the children just after 9pm that night, but when his wife went back at about 10pm Madeleine had gone from the apartment at 5A Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva.Jane Tanner, one of the friends dining with the McCanns, reported seeing a man carrying a child earlier that night. For years afterwards, the mystery man would be a key suspect, if not the prime suspect, but in October 2013 the politan Police announced that a British holidaymaker who had been taking his daughter back to his apartment after picking her up from an evening crèche had been identified as the man Miss Tanner had seen and ruled out of the inquiry.The first person to become an “arguido”, or official suspect, was Robert Murat, a local property consultant, whose home was searched 12 days after the disappearance. He was formally cleared of suspicion in 2008.Then in September that year, the McCanns themselves were made arguidos. The Portuguese police came up with the theory that Madeleine had been killed by her parents by accident, possibly by being given an overdose of a sedative to make her sleep, that they had hidden the body, faked her abduction and then used the hire car weeks later to move her body to a burial location.Kate McCann later claimed she was told by the Portuguese police that if she admitted that Madeleine had died in the apartment and she had hidden her body she might only serve a two-year sentence and Gerry McCann would not be charged at all.Goncalo Amaral, the chief inspector who had been in charge of the case, resigned in 2008 to write a book alleging that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment and the McCanns had faked the abduction. The McCanns sued him for libel, and won: Amaral was ordered to pay them £394,000 in damages, but in April 2016 that decision was overturned by an appeal court.Both the McCanns and Mr Murat were cleared of suspicion in 2008.For the next six years, Portuguese police made little progress, and in July 2013, following a review of the case by Scotland Yard at the request of then home secretary Theresa May, supported by prime minister David Cameron, Scotland Yard launched its own investigation, Operation Grange.The Yard announced it was looking into possible links between Madeleine’s disappearance and bogus charity collectors who were knocking on doors in Praia da Luz at the time. Between 3.30pm and 5.30pm on the day in question there were four separate sightings of men who said they were collecting money for an orphanage.British detectives believe men whose photofits they released in 2013 may have been engaged in reconnaissance for a pre-planned abduction or for burglaries, in keeping with the theory that Madeleine may have been killed by a burglar she disturbed.Another suspect was Euclides Monteiro, a convicted burglar with a drug habit, who had been sacked from the Ocean Club in 2006. Mobile phone tracking showed he had been in the area on the night of the disappearance, and police believe he may have been burgling apartments there to fund his drug addiction. He died in a tractor accident in 2009.Then, in May 2019, Portuguese media reported that local detectives were investigating a foreign paedophile as a suspect.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"amazon sorting centre near frances pont du gard affront romans","story":"Plans to build a vast Amazon sorting centre within sight of France\u0027s famed Pont du Gard are an “affront” to the Roman’s greatest aqueduct that is a Unesco world treasure, say detractors.Their warning comes amid a local row over whether the facility belonging to the American e-commerce conglomerate is an unwanted eyesore in a relatively untouched area or an economic gift horse in a southern French region in desperate need of jobs.The 2,000-year old Pont du Gard rises 160ft and s 1,500ft of the Gardon valley. It is the highest of all Roman aqueduct bridges, and one of the best-preserved. The monument near Nimes is the fifth most visited monument in France, with around 1.25 million visits per year.Some 20,000 people have signed a petition calling for local authorities to halt the imminent construction of the “immense” 40,000 square metre sorting centre on current Côte-du-Rhône vineyards belonging to the village of Fournès.Calling the site a “blot on the landscape”, petitioners say the centre “will be the first and the last image that millions of visitors to the Pont du Gard and the region will see”.“The proposal to undertake such a major industrial project adjacent to this exceptional site would represent an irreversible assault on the heritage of the Gard, the Occitania region and France,” claim local environment and heritage defence groups Adere and Prima Vera.The expected 500 lorries and 3,000 vehicles that will transport goods from the site will create “pollution, road congestion, explosion of CO2 emissions, health risks,” they argue.The project has split the local population, with officials of a string of nearby villages dead against it, backed by some residents and an influential crowd of Parisian neo-rurals, reportedly including ex-culture minister Françoise Nyssen.However, a group of other 17 villages around the Pont du Gard and Fournès’ mayor, Christelle Hinque, support the plan.Claude Martinet, incumbent mayor of nearby Montfrin said: “Even if I don’t agree with everything Amazon does, this project is indispensable. It will create jobs. For once a business is interested in us, we shouldn’t refuse. If we stop them from coming, they’ll go elsewhere,” he told Nouvel Obs. At 13 percent, the local unemployment rate is well above the national average.Detractors counter that since promising 600 jobs, the figure has already dropped to 150 and could reduce further due to “robotisation”. They cite ex-French digital minister Mounir Mahjoubi who said that for every job Amazon creates in France, it destroys 2.2 others in traditional commerce.Since receiving planning permission in September 2019, Adere has sued Ms Hinque and other officials for “illegal conflict of interest” as they sold their land to the developer in charge of the site.France’s Confederation of merchants has also waded in, calling Amazon centres in general “an attack against physical commerce, which doesn’t benefit from the same rules”. Its petition to oust such centres altogether from France has obtained 62,000 signatures.It has received the support of Delphine Batho, a Green MP who has tabled a draft bill calling for a two-year moratorium on all new Amazon logistics depots in France.“A major transformation of our economy is in the pipeline, which has been debated nowhere with devastating social and economic impacts,” she said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"iran losing influence iraq1","story":"Just like Sweden\u0027s Nobel Prize, the judging panel is made up of luminaries tasked with honouring outstanding achievement.The criteria, though, for winning Iran\u0027s new Qassem Soleimani Global Award will be rather different to its Scandinavian counterpart.Unveiled last month in memory of the hardline military chief killed by the US in Iraq, the award will champion acts of resistance by Tehran’s proxies across the Middle East.Yet if events since Mr Solaimani\u0027s death are anything to go by, the panel - which includes Iran\u0027s foreign minister - may struggle to find worthy recipients.When Mr Solaimani was killed by a US drone strike during a visit to Baghdad in January, Iran vowed severe revenge against the US through its proxy militias in Iraq. The pro-Iranian bloc in Iraq\u0027s parliament also demanded the withdrawal of the 5,000 US and coalition troops in Iraq to help fight Islamic State.Nearly six months on, though, the foreign troops are still stationed across Iraq and look set to stay for some time. And apart from a rocket attack on a coalition base in March that killed a British soldier and two Americans, Iran-backed Shia militias have yet to make good their threats to avenge Solaimani\u0027s death in spectacular fashion.Moreover, Iraq has just appointed its most pro-Western prime minister in years. Mustafa al-Khadimi was sworn in earlier this month, replacing Adel Abdul Mahdi, who stepped down last November in the wake of huge anti-government protests.For the past four years, Mr al-Khadimi has run Iraq\u0027s intelligence service, where he worked closely with the coalition in the fight against Isis. He previously spent years in Britain as a journalist and human rights campaigner, having fled Iraq during Saddam Hussein’s rule.He is both a liberal and non-sectarian, said Sarkawt Sams, a Kurdish MP who once worked as a journalist with Mr al-Khadimi. He doesn\u0027t want to make trouble with Iran, he’s just pro-Iraq. He also realises that we cannot survive right now without US support.A crunch point looms in mid-June, when the US and Iraq are expected to hold a strategic dialogue conference to set out their future relationship. Far from bowing to demands to withdraw all troops, America and the wider coalition is likely to lobby for a continued - albeit smaller - presence to ensure that the Islamic State does not resurge.There is scope for an agreement on a more focused and probably smaller troop presence in Iraq to counter Daesh (Islamic State) in the future, one Western official told The .Mr al-Khadimi\u0027s appointment reflects the fact that the Iranian military chief who replaced Mr Solaimani has struggled to wield the same influence in Iraq as his predecessor did.Esmail Ghani, a senior commander in Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards, visited Baghdad in late March, in a bid to exercise sway over the choice of the new prime minister. But as a non-Arabic speaker who lacks both Mr Solaimani\u0027s warrior charisma and personal connections, the reception was lukewarm. Some senior Shia leaders declined to meet him.Solaimani had enormous influence over different Iraqi politicians, and Ghaani has struggled to fill those shoes, said the Western official. He has not had the same influence, for example, over the formation of the new government.Nonetheless, given the strength of the pro-Iranian bloc in the Iraqi government, Mr al-Khadimi was still a surprising choice. Mr Sams beleives that some in the bloc have cooled to Tehran since the anti-government protests, which were partly a nationalist outcry against Iranian influence.The pressure from the street has been huge - it is anti-Iranian even if it is not explicitly pro-US, added Mr Sams, who received death threats from militias for refusing to vote for the troop pull-out. Iran is finding that it doesn\u0027t have that many truly loyal friends in Iraq.Mr al-Khadimi, who is regarded as a media-savvy technocrat, has already made his mark. Among his first acts was to order the release of some of the hundreds of people arrested during the protests, which had ground Baghdad and many other cities to a standstill.He has also promised a more rigorous probe into the gun attacks mounted on some of the protests last year, in which around 600 people were killed. Pro-Iranian militia groups and Iraqi security forces were widely blamed, but an inquiry by the previous prime minister concluded only that they were unidentified gunmen.“It remains to be seen if al-Khadimi can deliver on these promises, cautioned Aymen Salman, a Baghdad protester. So far, no protesters have been freed , and if he arrests those who did the shootings, he may run up against powerful political interests.In an early boost for Mr al-Khadimi, some more moderate elements of the Peoples\u0027 Mobilisation Units - the Iran-backed Shia militias mobilised in 2014 to help fight Isis - have already opted to come under full government control. The move is thought to be an effort to distance themselves from more extreme pro-Iranian units, such as Khataib Hezbollah, suspected of the March attack on the coalition base.In return for backing Mr al-Khadimi, Washington is likely to lean heavily on him to do more to assert Baghdad\u0027s independence from Tehran.The US will want assurances that Iran-backed groups are put firmly in their place, said Robert Tollast, of Middle East analysis firm NAMEA. That will mean cooperating with the US to enforce targeted sanctions against Iran\u0027s financial interests in Iraq, and if Iran oversteps in Iraq militarily, could extend to security cooperation against Iran\u0027s Iraqi proxies.Should Mr al-Khadimi face push-back from Iraq\u0027s pro-Iranian block, Washington could withdraw its multi-billion dollar financial support to the Iraqi government. It is currently facing fiscal meltdown because of the collapse in world oil prices caused by the coronavirus.However, having spent much of his time in Britain, Mr al-Khadimi has no real Iraqi power base of his own, which means he is could easily be ousted. Iran, says Mr Tollast, remains deeply entrenched in Iraq, through militia proxies on the government payroll and sympathetic politicians and business networks. We can\u0027t expect an absolute winner in terms of US-Iranian competition, he added.Steering a successful course between America and Iran\u0027s rival interests could make al-Khadimi a watershed leader for Iraq. Given the odds against him, though, many would rate his chances of success only slightly higher than his chances of winning the Qassem Solaimani Global Award.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"kate gerry mccann couple refuse give hope","story":"The parents of Madeleine McCann have reacted to the news that a new suspect has been identified in the disappearance of their daughter by vowing to “never give up hope” of finding her alive.As their 13-year long quest to uncover the truth of how she went missing took a new turn, Kate and Gerry McCann said: “All we have ever wanted is to find her, uncover the truth and bring those responsible to justice.We will never give up hope of finding Madeleine alive, but whatever the outcome may be, we need to know as we need to find peace.Ever since her disappearance, Madeleine\u0027s parents have campaigned to find their daughter, appearing in television interviews and posting updates on social media.Just last month they said they were “buoyed up” by the happy news that a Chinese family was reunited with their missing son after 32 years.As they wished that family “all the best”, the McCanns recalled the day that their perfect nuclear family was hit by horror.On May 3 2007, the couple, from Rothley, Leicestershire, left their three children asleep in their holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in southern Portugal while they had dinner with friends at a nearby tapas restaurant.Mr McCann found nothing amiss when he checked on the youngsters just after 9pm, but when his wife returned at about 10pm she discovered three-year-old Madeleine was missing.Driven by an almost feral reaction they carried out a desperate search and raised the alarm, but from that night their lives would never be the same again.The couple are both from close-knit working-class Catholic families and have found solace through their relatives and their faith in the years since Madeleine\u0027s disappearance.Mr McCann is from Glasgow and his wife from Liverpool, but they met while working as junior doctors at the Western Infirmary in Glasgow.Mrs McCann stopped working as a GP after her daughter went missing to focus on campaign work and her two other children, twins Amelie and Sean, aged just two when Madeleine disappeared.She poured her energies into charity work, including as an ambassador for the Missing People charity, before returning to work in another area of medicine.Mr McCann is a professor of cardiac imaging at the University of Leicester and a consultant cardiologist who has been open about his mental health struggles since the night Madeleine went missing.Over the years the McCann family have launched numerous public appeals, won high-profile backers, seen millions of pounds in public money spent on investigations, all to no avail.In 2017, the McCanns said they had managed to adjust to a new normality of being a family-of-four, with their focus on giving the twins a very normal, happy and fulfilling life.Speaking to the BBC on the 10-year anniversary of her daughter\u0027s disappearance, Mrs McCann said: We had some excellent advice early on. We have been as open with them as we can. We have told them about things and that people are writing things that are simply just untrue and they need to be aware of that.Madeleine\u0027s parents admitted they have been shocked by hurtful online abuse, saying they had seen the worst and the best of human nature since the campaign to find their daughter thrust them into the spotlight.They have also endured a long-running libel battle against Goncalo Amaral, the Portuguese detective who led the initial inquiry into Madeleine\u0027s disappearance, who alleged in a book that the girl had died in the holiday flat.In 2017, Mrs McCann blasted the misinformation, half-truths and downright lies that had circulated around her daughter\u0027s case, but her husband has insisted that overall they had been overwhelmingly seeing the better side of human nature and received fantastic support.Over the years, the McCanns have built a bond with the Portuguese town where they last saw their daughter.The couple were regular visitors to the church of Our Lady of Light in Praia da Luz after Madeleine\u0027s disappearance.In 2017, it was revealed that villagers in Praia da Luz have prayed for Madeleine every Sunday since.In a letter written that year, Mrs McCann thanked local friends and supporters for being strong enough and brave enough to keep Madeleine and our family in your prayers and in your hearts.She added: Your love and compassion has given us fortitude over the years and sustained our hope in immeasurable amounts.As sad and difficult anniversaries come and go, Madeleine\u0027s parents refuse to give up hope.In 2017, Mrs McCann said she continued to buy birthday and Christmas presents for Madeleine.Last Christmas, a message on the official Find Madeleine Facebook page, said nothing has changed.As they faced their 13th Christmas without their daughter, the McCanns added: We love her, we miss her, we hope as always.The search for Madeleine goes on with unwavering commitment.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"listen former head mi6 believes pandemic started accident","story":"The coronavirus crisis has strained relations between China — the source of the pandemic — and Europe, one of the regions worst hit by the disease.

She said the driver shot Falconio and tied her up, before she managed to escape and hide in the bush.The case made headlines all over the world. Bradley Murdoch was convicted of murdering Falconio, although a body was never found.A Channel 4 documentary, Murder in the Outback: The Falconio and Lees Mystery reviews the evidence from the trial and casts doubt on the conviction.It also presents for the first time an expert report that, the film claims, was not put before the jury at Murdoch’s 2005 trial. The Scientific Content Analysis (SCAN) report used a technique that assessed the language used by witnesses or suspects.Four analysts looked at the statement that Lees gave to police on the night after Falconio’s disappearance. At several points in her account of being tied up by Murdoch, Lees said she could not remember particular details or said her memory was hazy.The report said: “These statements are all indicative of a false account. There is missing time, missing information and no commitment to an account. This part of the story is particularly sketchy.”The analysts said that Lees’ habit of switching to the present tense when recounting events was a sign that she was not telling the truth. They concluded: “This account provided by the subject has strong indications of being deceptive. The statement has many contradictions and lacks commitment from the subject.”The documentary shows Lees being confronted with this information in a police interview. A detective told her: “The consensus without exception is that there is vital information missing from this statement. Asked what information was missing, Lees replied: “I don’t know.”According to the documentary, the report was not put in evidence at Murdoch’s trial, meaning his defence counsel could not cross-examine Lees on its contents.However, SCAN analysis is controversial and a 2001 study commissioned by the Home Office concluded that there is no clear evidence that it can significantly improve an experienced investigator’s ability to determine truth or deceit in a written statement.The documentary also includes the verdict of Bill Beale, a SCAN trainer, who re-assessed Lees’ statement and said he was satisfied that she was telling the truth.Beale said that in the years since the case, it has been discovered that women often switch to the present tense when reliving a traumatic event.Murder in the Outback, which begins on Sunday and runs over four consecutive nights, features interviews with the truck driver who rescued Lees on the night of the incident, and a man who is convinced he saw Falconio several days after the disappearance in a town more than 1,000 miles away.It follows the attempts of Andrew Fraser, a former lawyer, who is campaigning for Murdoch’s conviction to be overturned. The documentary examines various theories, including that Murdoch (below) is a victim of mistaken identity and that Falconio, 28, may have faked his own death.It also questions the reliability of the DNA evidence used to convict Murdoch.The police officer who led the original case appears in the programme and says he is convinced of Murdoch’s guilt.When Lees, then 27, first appeared before the press following Falconio’s disappearance, she was criticised for her aloof manner. But the police liaison officer who managed her media appearances told the film-makers that Lees was unfairly judged because people “believe women should behave in a certain way… had she cried, things would have been different.”Lees is reported to be living in Australia, and appeared on television there in 2017, in the current affairs programme 60 Minutes. She returned to the crime scene and said she would not give up on her search for Falconio’s body.She said then: “Pete’s still missing. I know that he’s somewhere here. His spirit just feels stronger whilst I’m in this area because I know he’s nearby. It’s because I love Pete so much and I want to bring him home and I need to bring him home.”Lees and Falconio’s family declined to be interviewed for the documentary.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"two metre rule political decision needing nuanced approach says","story":"Standing back-to-back, ordering remotely and sitting at tables only with members of the same household are among measures that have been proposed.So a fleeting instance where you have been within two metres of somebody is nowhere near the same risk as face-to-face for 15-20 minutes with that person.So it may be time for a slightly more nuanced approach, an interpretation of what we mean by two metres.It is a political decision, whatever distance it is.His comments were supported by Professor Catherine Noakes, who sits on the main Sage committee and said: Two metres isn\u0027t a magic distance at all.I think people get very hung up on two metres.

Universities are preparing for it.” Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute said.“There are concerns that the online learning experience may not be as good as in person. There is always an excitement about freshers’ week, and students will think they are not going to have any of that.”A survey published last month found that over a fifth of university applicants have said they will defer their places if plans to put lectures online go ahead.Up to 23 per cent of prospective students said they would no longer want to take up a place at university this autumn if it is not “operating as usual”, according to a report by London Economics for the University and College Union.This would mean an estimated 120,000 students may delay attending British campuses when the academic year begins in September and October.Earlier this week, university leaders revealed that they are drawing up plans for students to be grouped into “bubbles” to live and study together in a bid to limit the transmission of coronavirus on campus.The arrangement will see students ided into groups of students from the same course as them and allocated the same hall of residence as the others in their group. Prof Sir Steve Smith, vice-Chancellor of Exeter University, told The : “What we are trying to work out is the extent to which there will be a bigger percentage than normal who defer. I am in touch every day with my team about this, we need to prepare for two or three very different outcomes.”He said that for prestigious Russell Group universities that have multiple students applying for every place, a wave of deferrals pose less of an issue than they do to less competitive institutions.Prof Smith said that he “totally sympathises” with students who do want to defer their places, acknowledging that the experience they will have this year will not be what they envisaged.“Vice-Chancellors are spending all their time trying to make sure that online lectures will be the highest quality, it is challenging, and it won’t be the same,” he said.Prof Julia Buckingham, president of Universities UK (UUK) which represents vice-Chancellors, insisted this week that this remains an incredibly “exciting” time to go to university, adding that a good degree will prepare students for what will be a “very challenging jobs market”.UUK warned ministers in April that they faced “major financial risks” in the 2020-21 academic year due to a fall in the number of international students combined with a rise in undergraduate deferrals from home students. They said that without Government support, some institutions will face “financial failure”.It comes as the universities watchdog, the Office for Students, publishes a new report into drop out rates and degree outcomes.Less than two thirds of poorest students graduate with a first class degree or an upper second, compared to 85 per cent of wealthier peers, the report found.It also found that the poorest students, defined as those who were eligible for free school meals in the six years prior to their GCSEs, were also more likely to drop out than those from more privileged backgrounds.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"craven response coronavirus breeding generation miserable youngsters","story":"They f--- you up, your Mum and Dad. They may not mean to but they do  They fill you with the faults they had  And add some extra, just for you”, wrote Philip Larkin in the rebellious Seventies. Were Larkin composing in the time of corona, he might add swathes of the adult world to his list of offenders.Education unions are doggedly resisting plans to reopen schools, and though some teachers have kept their charges busy and informed under lockdown, this cannot be said of all. The Sutton Trust reports that two thirds of children have not received any online lessons, with the neediest left floundering. While some primary school pupils returned to school this week – albeit to playground temperature checks and other sinister protocols – millions of under-18s are still sitting listlessly at home. This is a crisis to which the Government should be applying the same moral urgency it did to expanding NHS capacity or keeping food supply chains running. In the face of resistance, however, it is merely backing down on its promise to have all primary children back by the beginning of July.Students taking up their university places this year, meanwhile, are likely to be greeted by a “virtual” freshers’ week, featuring online lectures and one-way systems across campus. Save for Hemingway’s “tragedy in six words”: “For sale, baby shoes, never worn”, can there be a more mournful phrase than “virtual freshers’ week”?It gets worse. Under plans drawn up by vice-chancellors, students could be grouped into “bubbles” to live and study together in a bid to limit transmission on campus. Beyond the social lottery this entails (imagine being paired with a bunch of rotters and being barred from meeting anyone else), social distancing neatly excises much that makes university worthwhile. Student life experienced at two metres’ distance, or through a screen, is like trying to travel the world via a Lonely Planet guide. Many will now defer their entry, but intensified competition as two years apply at once inevitably means that students will miss out on top places they would have secured under normal circumstances.The irony is that these miserablist schemes are unnecessary. As everyone in government and higher education knows, for the young, the virus’s risks are negligible – certainly compared with the risks of serious mental health problems due to atomised living, being forced into protective bubbles at university and treated like diseased creatures at school. Universities should of course protect the minority of staff and students in “high-risk” groups, but their failure to demand normality for the rest is a betrayal of their pastoral duties. Some authorities have even refused to offer refunds or reduced fees, arguing that students are receiving the “same” service – a level of sophistry that only a professional academic could achieve.Facing adversity is character-building, allegedly, and the pandemic offers plenty of that. Yet our locked-down young lack even the freedom to venture out into the world and make mistakes. Those of us in our mid-to-late 20s may moan about postponed weddings and interrupted social lives, but most of us have had some fun, know who our friends are and have gained at least a foothold in our careers. The younger crop have barely begun the trial and error process of life.Besides the social penalty, their economic situation is comparatively dire too new starters are more likely to be furloughed – some will find they have no job to return to. Many firms are paring back their graduate schemes, and apprenticeship recruitment has already taken a hit.The authorities’ negligence in fighting for the young on multiple fronts is a scandal which runs against the proper order of things. It took philosophers and reformers centuries to convince society to view children as independent moral beings, deserving of rights, not merely as the property of their parents. Yet in their neglect, craven authorities and teaching unions are echoing a pre-Victorian view of the young as inherently less valuable than the rest of the population. Between the scandalous lack of urgency on school reopenings, universities’ feeble efforts to fight for their students, and the Government’s own political cowardice, we are conspiring to make a whole generation miserable.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/06/04/TELEMMGLPICT000232414796_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqUaGs7jc7oGYE8c0ezfrmAtAKFk2dGAMM9NwEKHtMZOQ.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"madeleine mccann latest news two three people know happened","story":"Only two or three people know what has happened to Madeleine McCann, according to the family\u0027s spokesman, as one key witness has been urged to come forward. A German prisoner has been identified as a suspect by Scotland Yard in the case of the missing girl, who vanished from Praia da Luz in 2007. Clarence Mitchell - who down the years has been a representative of the McCanns  - has hinted this breakthrough is the most significant in 13 years.He told the BBC\u0027s Radio 4 Today programme that in his time involved in the case, he cannot recall such focus on one inidual, and stressed that it is the family\u0027s belief that only two or three people maximum on the planet know what has happened to Madeleine.His interview is available for you read in full below.The police themselves have called it a significant part of the investigation.It\u0027s the first time in 13 years that I can recall focusing on one inidual, not named but clearly identifiable by them and the authorities, in terms of wanting to know extra detail about this movements and the vehicles he was using even down to the phone calls he was apparently receiving on the night where Maddie went missing. The Jaguar linked to the prime suspectSo Kate and Gerry do feel it\u0027s potentially very significant. They have welcomed the appeal, but they\u0027re not doing any interviews themselves because they wish the focus to remain on the police request rather than themselves. But this is an important chapter in the search for their daughter. They\u0027ve never given up hope that she may still be alive, but they are realistic and they say whatever the outcome of this particular line of investigation, they do need to know what happened to their daughter to find peace and to bring whoever is responsible to justice.The German police are classing it as a murder investigation in sharp contrast the British police are not saying that and are classing it as a missing person.The British police have been at pains to say there is no evidence at all she has come to harm, is dead or indeed alive. They are literally keeping an open mind about it. The police and the private investigators brought in by the family have always thought that only two or three people maximum on the planet know what happened to Madeleine. In this case the police are looking at a particular phone call that I understand was received by somebody else on a Portuguese number.The German police and the British police have made it clear the person making the call is not a suspect but a material witness in this, which is why they\u0027ve released those Portuguese numbers in the hope that they might jog somebody\u0027s memory. Are they in their contacts? Were they ever phoned by these numbers? And of course the distinctive vehicles - the campervan and the distinctive Jaguar - that he is said to have been using. It\u0027s 13 years on, but the police still feel it\u0027s important to bring these details out now in the hope that somebody out there can still come forward and make that call. There have. There have been countless sightings, tip-offs, rumours, assumptions made usually by the media, which have all sadly come to nothing. Nor would I want to talk about any sense of hope or optimism around this one given the circumstances. But as I say, in my memory of being in the case, police have never been quite so specific about an inidual as they have been about this inidual. They make the point that allegiances change. This man is in prison and if he is involved to the extent it appears, then people shouldn\u0027t be afraid to come forward now.George Floyd protests: Donald Trump’s former defence chief launches blistering attack on ‘isive’ presidentPolitics latest news: Commons \u0026#39conga lines\u0026#39 U-turn after Alok Sharma is tested for coronavirusThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayKate and Gerry McCann: The couple who refuse to give up hopeWhen did Madeleine McCann go missing?

Our liquidity needs thereafter will depend, among other things, on the timing of a full resumption of operations, the timing of movie releases and our ability to generate revenues,” the company wrote, warning that its estimates might not be correct because it has ”never previously experienced a complete cessation of our operations”.It then warned that if operations don’t resume at the estimated time, or if revenues don’t match expected levels, or if a new Covid-19 wave triggers another shutdown, it might require additional financing.“Due to these factors, substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time,” the company wrote.“Going concern” is a term used to refer to a viable company that has the ability to keep operating for the foreseeable future, without threat of liquidation.Preliminary estimates, which have yet to be audited, shows a loss of $2.1bn to $2.4bn for AMC Theatres in the first quarter of 2020.States across the US are reopening on different timelines.

HSBC “respects and supports all laws that stabilise Hong Kong’s social order,” it said in a post on social media in China.StanChart later said it believed the law can “help maintain the long term economic and social stability of Hong Kong”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBoth banks are based in Britain but have a significant Asia focus. Markets responded positively to the announcement which allayed concerns about the banks getting hurt by any potential political crossfire in their largest market.UK gave training and ‘support’ to Hong Kong police accused of abuses“Does HSBC feel compelled to weigh in on other laws in other countries? We have watched over the past week China clearly assert pressure on businesses and other actors to show their support for the law to create the illusion of support,” said Sophie Richardson, China director for US-based Human Rights Watch.HSBC was caught up in Hong Kong’s months-long anti-government protests, with its branches vandalised and bronze lion statues outside its headquarters defaced during a protest march on 1 January.Some protesters accused HSBC of being complicit in action by the authorities against activists trying to raise money to support protesters, accusations the bank denied.Some of HSBC’s corporate peers have faced retribution from Beijing for perceived support for the anti-government protesters. Cathay Pacific Airways last year was forced to suspend staff involved in the protests, and chief executive Rupert Hogg and his top deputy resigned in August.Now Europe’s largest bank, HSBC has its origins in Hong Kong, a British colony until 1997. It has previously avoided weighing in on the political situation there in recent months, while facing increased calls in Chinese state media to make its position clear.A Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for the bank declined to comment beyond the contents of the post.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has invested billions of dollars in China to grow its market share in the world’s second-largest economy, and it has become harder for the bank to follow an apolitical line as it faces criticism from both the pro- and anti-Beijing camps.PM promises UK will ‘provide an alternative’ for Hong Kong citizensChina ‘should take a step back’ on Hong Kong, Dominic Raab saysHong Kong’s annual Tiananmen Square vigil banned for first timeShould Britain take stronger action over Hong Kong?“The US no longer considers Hong Kong autonomous from China and there are risks that HSBC becomes a political football after Peter Wong’s declaration of support for the new national security law,” Will Howlett, analyst at HSBC shareholder Quilter Cheviot, said.Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the guarantee of freedoms, such as an independent legal system and right to protest, not enjoyed on the mainland.The city was rocked by unrest last year by pro-democracy protesters fearing an erosion of those freedoms by Communist Party rulers in Beijing. China denies this and accuses the West of stirring up trouble.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said London would not walk away from the people of Hong Kong if China imposed the new law.Britain has called the law “authoritarian” and said it is in breach of the “one country, two systems” principle enshrined in a 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration.Jardines Group, one of Hong Kong’s original foreign trading houses, published a full-page statement in the pro-Beijing newspaper, Ta Kung Pao, saying it was important to enact a legal framework to safeguard the city’s national security.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We never faced the structural unemployment that we saw in the 1980s.Unemployment expected to be in double digits through November electionHe added that the Government must make sure unemployed workers do not end up on long-term benefits.The former Tory chancellor explained: Governments of all colours since the Second World War have not done terribly well at getting structurally unemployed people back into work.The pair were giving evidence alongside former Tory chancellor Philip Hammond, who said there were too many uncertainties to know how quickly and successfully the economy can recover.He said: A lot is going to depend whether over the next months it is clear that we are heading towards a vaccine or treatment for this disease and returning the economy to something like normal, or, by contrast, that we\u0027re not heading towards an early vaccine or a treatment and we have to plan, in terms of restarting the economy living with Covid - restructuring our businesses so they can operate in a sub-optimal way so they can operate with the disease.All three said the Government should not concern itself with the high levels of debt the UK is wracking up in the short term, avoid tax rises and consider tax cuts either through a VAT reduction or national insurance payments.Mr Hammond said there was no economic logic to increasing taxes in the short term.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, more are expected to do so in the coming days.Boris Johnson had urged schools to allow pupils in reception, year 1 and year 6 to return to school, but had conceded that he could not force them to do so until they were suitably prepared.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?While many schools have continued physical lessons for vulnerable children and those whose parents are key workers, the vast majority of pupils have been learning online at home – but there are also significant numbers without the means to do so.Despite the risks of some 700,000 children without laptops or tablets falling behind, with school leaders fearing some “may never return” to schools if they remain closed all summer, unions and scientists have criticised the government’s decision to start reopening schools on 1 June.The Independent Sage group warned the move could risk “a new surge” of Covid-19 cases in certain communities, accusing the government of not listening to its own scientific advice, The government’s own scientific advisory committee, Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), has modelled the impact of seven different ways schools could reopen, which all result in the R rate – or the rate of transmission – increasing, the group said.“The school reopening scenario chosen by the government is not one of those modelled by Sage, making the potential impact of reopening even more uncertain,” said the report by Independent Sage. “Robust testing systems are not in place everywhere.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Having reviewed the scientific and medical advice from Sage, all of us want to ensure children can get the education they need whilst ensuring the risk of transmission is very low.​”On Wednesday, chief medical officer for England Professor Chris Whitty reassured parents the risk of coronavirus to children is low as he stressed the importance of schools reopening.“Clearly there’s a very complicated balancing act for society in terms of the possibility of increasing the transmission on the one hand and depriving children of their education on the other,” Prof Whitty said at the Downing Street briefing.“This is a very hard balancing act but this is where we’re trying to, as a society, walk between two risks, a risk to education and a risk to health. And the rates of transmission are now much lower than they were at the point when schools were closed.“I fully understand, as everyone fully understands, people wanting to think this through but ... the biggest concern is going to be the health of their children and this is a disease that can affect children but is very unlikely to compared to adults.”His remarks came as a University of Warwick study found the measures proposed for 1 June were unlikely to lead to a second wave of infection.“In isolation, this is unlikely to push R above 1, but there still remains uncertainty over the consequences of other recent changes that have relaxed the lockdown,” said lead author Professor Matt Keeling.Chief scientific officer Sir Patrick Vallance has warned that the R is close to 1 and that the level of new transmissions “is not coming down fast”, urging that the newly eased lockdown measures must be kept carefully under review.However, as seen in the northeast – which has the highest rate of infection in England – many school leaders have decided they are not willing to take the risk of reopening yet.“It was always reckless of Boris Johnson to set an arbitrary date and expect schools to fall in line,” said NEU joint general secretary Kevin Courtney. “Heads and their staff know far more about their inidual challenges than Whitehall ever will. As the regional variation according to coronavirus levels show, schools are listening to the science rather than politicians.“Not only is the safety of the government’s plan in question but also the feasibility of it and confidence of headteachers in what the prime minister requested.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “From this week, many schools have begun welcoming children from reception, year 1 and year 6 back to the classroom as part of a phased and cautious approach.“To prepare for this, headteachers and school staff have been doing an excellent job, including putting protective measures in place and engaging with parents and children. We will continue to support schools who haven’t yet been able to open more widely to do so as soon as possible.”Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But the Department for Health and Social Care has repeatedly failed to provide a daily testing figure in May, an omission which No 10 has been unable to explain.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile the number of people tested remains unclear, the highest known daily total was 80,297 on 21 May. The health secretary revealed on Monday that capacity is now at 206,000, however this includes at least 40,000 antibody tests, which were counted towards the target after hospitals were instructed to start using them on Friday.The largest number of tests given on a single day was 164,757 on 19 May, with the most recent total at the time of writing on 31 May being less than 130,000.The government has acknowledged that large-scale testing and contact tracing will be vital to ending the lockdown, having promised in the earlier stages of the pandemic to eventually deliver 250,000 tests a day.After the government declared it had met its initial goal of providing 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April – a claim contested amid accusations of data manipulation – a new target for May was set.​This pledge was then watered down, with Downing Street stressing that the 200,000 target set by the PM related only to testing capacity and not to the number of tests actually carried out.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

HSBC “respects and supports all laws that stabilise Hong Kong’s social order,” it said in a post on social media in China.StanChart later said it believed the law can “help maintain the long term economic and social stability of Hong Kong”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBoth banks are based in Britain but have a significant Asia focus. Markets responded positively to the announcement which allayed concerns about the banks getting hurt by any potential political crossfire in their largest market.UK gave training and ‘support’ to Hong Kong police accused of abuses“Does HSBC feel compelled to weigh in on other laws in other countries? We have watched over the past week China clearly assert pressure on businesses and other actors to show their support for the law to create the illusion of support,” said Sophie Richardson, China director for US-based Human Rights Watch.HSBC was caught up in Hong Kong’s months-long anti-government protests, with its branches vandalised and bronze lion statues outside its headquarters defaced during a protest march on 1 January.Some protesters accused HSBC of being complicit in action by the authorities against activists trying to raise money to support protesters, accusations the bank denied.Some of HSBC’s corporate peers have faced retribution from Beijing for perceived support for the anti-government protesters. Cathay Pacific Airways last year was forced to suspend staff involved in the protests, and chief executive Rupert Hogg and his top deputy resigned in August.Now Europe’s largest bank, HSBC has its origins in Hong Kong, a British colony until 1997.

China denies this and accuses the West of stirring up trouble.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said London would not walk away from the people of Hong Kong if China imposed the new law.Britain has called the law “authoritarian” and said it is in breach of the “one country, two systems” principle enshrined in a 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration.Jardines Group, one of Hong Kong’s original foreign trading houses, published a full-page statement in the pro-Beijing newspaper, Ta Kung Pao, saying it was important to enact a legal framework to safeguard the city’s national security.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They may indeed actually be enjoying it, with longer walks and more attention and playtime than ever before.“No matter where I am or what I\u0027m doing, the three dogs are by my side, laying a head on my knee through hours of Zoom calls and helping me out in the land and garden from morning until night.“Dogs provide us with so much and ask very little back, just a walk, some food and a cuddle. Now they really need our support to make sure they can continue to do that vital work.”The research also revealed how cats and dogs had helped their owners get an issue off their chest - with one in 10 having moaned about a colleague to their furry friend.The research, carried out via OnePoll, coincides with Battersea’s new advertising campaign, which highlights the key role that rescue dogs and cats have played across the UK during quarantine.Ali Taylor, head of canine behaviour at Battersea, said: “We know there\u0027s evidence that owning a pet is good for mental health and tackling stress - and this is clearly really important at such a challenging time.Karol G apologises for using dog picture to support Black Lives MatterChina calls dogs \u0027companions\u0027 removes from list of livestock Think twice about getting pets during lockdown, animal charities warn“We\u0027ve heard so many amazing stories about how Battersea dogs and cats are now rescuing their owners - helping them feel less overwhelmed, distracting them from the news agenda.”Battersea helped more than 5,000 animals across its three centres last year, as well as using its expertise, influence, and voice to help thousands more all over the country and across the world.However, like all charities, Battersea is facing a significant drop in income as a direct impact of coronavirus and is reliant on the generosity of the public to continue to fund its vital work helping dogs and cats and the people who care for them.The charity is appealing for support to enable it to continue to help wonderful, imperfect, worth-it rescue dogs and cats.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At an altitude of 80 kilometres, they are 10 times higher than the next-highest clouds, the familiar “mare’s tails” of cirrus. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe see these clouds only during the summer months, when the Sun is not far below the horizon at night, and its rays can light up very high altitude clouds, just as we can see a high-flying plane lit up by sunshine even after sunset. And you need to be at a latitude between 50 and 70 degrees north – making the British Isles an ideal observing spot.Stunning gas cloud spotted after two stars get into celestial ‘fight’The clouds appear only rarely, and pretty unpredictably – though serious observers keep tabs on the view from Earth-observing satellites where they can discern signs of noctilucent clouds starting to form.You need a special combination of circumstances to make a good display. First, the upper atmosphere must be very cold. Then enough water vapour must be wafted up to this extreme altitude, or created by chemical reactions: recent research suggests that methane gas can produce water molecules when hit by the Sun’s radiation at the top of the atmosphere.Finally, you need tiny specks of solid matter for the ice to condense onto. But where does this dust come from? Here’s a big clue. Before 1885, there were no records of noctilucent clouds. They began to appear two years after the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, and meteorologists speculated that the ice is coating particles of volcanic dust.But big volcanic eruptions don’t happen every year. Astronomers weighed in with the idea that the clouds are due to water vapour freezing out on to the millions of tonnes of space dust that pours into Earth’s atmosphere each year.A century ago, you may have had to wait years to spot one of these ghostly wraiths now you are likely to see several over a single summerIn addition, we are seeding the upper atmosphere with dust every time we launch a rocket. Noctilucent clouds have appeared after past launches of the Space Shuttle, and – more recently – after one of Elon Musk’s Falcon 9 rockets was dispatched to space.And these clouds are becoming more common. A century ago, you may have had to wait years to spot one of these ghostly wraiths now you are likely to see several over a single summer. This trend is probably linked to global warming. First, there’s more the greenhouse gas methane around today, to create extra ice in the upper atmosphere. Also, higher temperatures at ground level actually lead to colder conditions at the top of the atmosphere, making it more likely water vapour will freeze out.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And keep your fingers crossed!Two brilliant stars are the first to appear in the darkening evening sky: orange Arcturus in the south and pure white Vega high in the east are the fourth and fifth brightest stars in the entire sky. Arcturus is the leading light of the kite-shaped constellation Bootes (the Herdsman), while Vega heads up the dim and diminutive star pattern of Lyra (the Lyre).As dusk turns to night, you’ll find a line of lesser luminaries below Arcturus. To the right, Regulus marks the heart of Leo (the Lion). Next is Spica, depicting a sheaf of corn held by Virgo (the Virgin), and then the red giant Antares in the Scorpius, the celestial Scorpion. And to the left lies Altair, in the constellation of Aquila (the Eagle).Even at the darkest hour, though, you’ll find the other stars making up these star patterns rather hard to spot. The stars of early summer are generally rather dim, compared to the brilliant winter constellations like Orion.When early astronomers drew up the sky patterns of summer, they created some huge and rambling constellations for this time of year. Look at Ophiuchus, for instance. He was the ancient god of healing, depicted holding a serpent – the constellation Serpens, which is attached to Ophiuchus. Or the long sinuous constellation of Hydra (the Water Snake) near the horizon. According to one theory, these long lines are stars were intentionally picked out by ancient navigators in the Mediterranean as a grid in the sky, like lines of latitude and longitude on the Earth. In the first week of June, you may just catch Mercury very low in the northwest after sunset.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.The Independent’s sister newspaper, the Evening Standard, today launched a major drive to find and fund the next Uber or Deliveroo.It has teamed up with one of the UK’s leading venture capital firms, Triple Point, to offer £100,000 to £150,000 to the most promising start-up tech ideas.The Spirit of London Kickstart Fund was launched against the backdrop of a challenging time for start-ups, as investors are fearful of investing amid the economic uncertainty triggered by the Covid crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, while funding is proving difficult, the crisis is creating huge opportunities for entrepreneurs in areas such as health technology, education technology and retail technology as industries struggle with working under more restricted circumstances of lockdowns and work from home.Triple Point’s Daniel Cardenas-Clark said Covid-19 has lowered the cost of starting a business due to cheaper office rents and advertising rates, creating huge opportunities for start-up businesses. “The world is now a different place than it was before the lockdown and the way we used to do almost everything has changed.We are looking for great innovators to help the post-covid recoveryThis change has brought with it an array of opportunities for innovative start-ups and creative entrepreneurs.  Triple Point are delighted to have partnered with the Evening Standard to fund the next generation of talented founders during this difficult time“.Some of the world’s most spectacular business success stories have born in times of recession. Around 20 so-called “unicorn” companies – start-ups which are now worth over $1bn (£800m) – were launched in the darkest days of the global financial crisis. These include Airbnb, Slack and Pinterest, as well as Uber.Russ Shaw of lobby group Tech London Advocates, said: “This will be a hugely popular initiative. We are hearing from a lot startups who are struggling to get funding and it is those in the earliest stage businesses that are hurting the most. The very people this fund is aiming at.”The UK government has recognised the importance new businesses will have in employing people likely to be losing their jobs in the coming months. It has set aside £500m for early stage companies in its Future Fund.The post-coronavirus world will offer new investment opportunitiesCoronavirus will strengthen the case for responsible investingThe start-ups fighting to feed the nation during this moment of crisisWhile that has been inundated with applications and is welcomed by entrepreneurs, the Future Fund is only available to firms who have already raised £250,000 in private investment.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are some of the stories behind the statistics:Sharing the full story, not just the headlines‘I work so hard yet I can’t afford the basics’: The NHS worker with no support from the stateTheo Manugerwa was struggling before the coronavirus crisis began. The 47-year-old, who lives with her two daughters aged 12 and 10 in Leicester, has been working in the NHS for 11 years, but her immigration status means she has no recourse to public funds (NRPF) – meaning she cannot claim any form of state support. As a result, the single mother has always had to work overtime in order to afford rent and provide for her children.Since lockdown started, Theo has been unable to work the extra hours.Her children are still going to school as she is a key worker, but after-school clubs are no longer operating and the friends who used to look after them while she was at work are no longer able to, due to the lockdown.She says: “It has become very hard. Once I take off my rent, I’m left with nothing at all. It has always been difficult, from the day they gave me that NRPF condition, but at least I could get extra shifts here and there to put food on the table for my children.How to support our campaign“The money I’m making now is not enough to cater for the three of us. We are depending on charity. I’ve always been very proud. I didn’t want to give in and ask for help. The feeling when you walk into a food bank is very painful. I work so hard yet I can’t afford the basics.”Theo, a Ugandan national who moved to the UK 20 years ago, is due to apply for her next visa extension next month, at a cost of more than £2,000, and she says the thought of it makes her feel sick. The Home Office told The Independent it would help Theo apply to get access to benefits under measures introduced to tackle the pandemic. But for now, she has also fallen into rent arrears, and fears she is going to generate serious debt. “I just need some support. I have no support at all. You get tired of depending on people. You don’t want to keep telling people your problems. I feel undervalued as a health worker during this time.“I feel abandoned. I’ve always worked hard to provide for my children, but it makes me feel like I’ve let them down.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Both financially and mentally,” says Sian Abbott. The 28-year-old’s family of seven started using food banks about a year ago when her husband lost his job as a poultry farmer – and she says things have become even more difficult during the Covid-19 crisis.Sian, who lives in Pembrokeshire and has five children, aged between 10 and three, says: “Three weeks into the pandemic I had a breakdown. We ran out of food because the food bank people couldn’t get to us. I ended up reaching out to my church and they sent us an emergency supply package.“It’s stressful, especially with the school closures. At least when the kids were in school they were able to get a meal. My husband and I go without meals sometimes so the children can eat.”Sian, who previously worked as a taxi controller and a carer but had to stop working to look after her autistic son, says she has noticed a lot more people who didn’t previously use food banks are now turning to them, but worries that the supply isn’t there.“In the supermarkets there used to be trolleys full of donations, but now there’s barely one. Prices are higher. The cost of nappies have nearly doubled, which is really difficult for us,” she adds.“It’s funny because when we first heard about food banks six years ago we were donating to them – usually around £50 or £60 a week – but now we’re having to rely on them ourselves.”Zoe Green and her husband David are “really struggling financially” for the very first time. The couple and their four children – aged from two to 11 – now depend on a weekly parcel from a food bank based at their local school in north London, a project supplied with fresh produce by The Felix Project charity.Ms Green, a 36-year-old freelancer who worked in TV and documentary production, hasn’t been able to find any work over the past few months. She received less than £1,000 pounds for a three-month period after applying for the government’s self-employment income support scheme.Although 39-year-old Mr Green still gets around £400 a month while on furlough from his part-time retail job, the couple have found they have a shortfall of around £300 a month for household bills. This is being met by The Film and TV Charity, but the couple do not know how long the emergency stipend will last.“It’s not been an easy time – we’ve never known food poverty until the coronavirus hit,” she said. “When we got the first food package from The Felix Project, I was literally crying as I took out all the fresh food. The work they and the other charities are doing right now is really, really appreciated. I never thought we’d need it.”“I’m really hoping the government will extend the self-employment scheme. I’m also hoping they might factor out the periods I was on maternity leave and wasn’t able to earn as much, so I can get a higher average amount.”‘Food banks have been a godsend’: Self-employed mother who isn’t eligible for government support Susan, 45, said she found herself in financial difficulty in the months before the pandemic after her fledging health drink business collapsed.The children going hungry during the coronavirus pandemicFood bank demand soars as newly unemployed wait weeks for benefitsAlthough she set herself up as a private education tutor in February 2020, she found she wasn’t eligible to apply for the government’s self-employment income support scheme after lockdown began.“I struggled to be able to buy food during the lockdown, as I’d lost income and also fell through the government net,” said the west Londoner. “It made a difficult situation even more difficult.”She and her two children, aged 10 and 12, are now relying on a weekly food bank set up at the Bollo Brook Youth Centre on her south Acton estate. “The children being at home is tough to manage. It’s stressful trying to keep up with it all and help with their school work whilst worrying about bills,” she said.“We’ve been fortunate and receive help with food that we would not have been able to buy. It’s been godsend to get us through this time until we can rebuild our lives back to normal.”‘It’s a battle to keep going’: Food bank manager whose demand is up tenfoldOriginally set up to provide support for single fathers, the Dads House charity now runs food banks for anyone in financial need at two sites in west and south London.Founder Billy McGranaghan said he and his volunteers saw between 30 and 50 people looking for help each day before the pandemic, but in the past couple of months demand for food parcels has shot up tenfold to between 300 and 500 people a day.“It’s heartbreaking to see the long queues,” he said. “The volume is something we’ve never seen before. It’s poverty like you’ve never seen. People tell us they’ve got £20 or £30 to get through the week. Some are telling us they’re having to sell possessions or borrow money from loan sharks.”Mr McGranaghan added: “Some people had been in very casual work before the crisis – bar staff, nannies, cleaners. So there’s no furloughing going on to help them. But in many cases they’re not necessarily self-employed either – they were dependant on that weekly wage. So they’re not eligible for the government self-employed scheme.”The food bank founder said many people were applying for universal credit, but they are forced to face at least five weeks before any money appears in their bank account.“I’m just hoping some people are able to get back into work when the shops re-open in a couple of weeks,” he said. “But at the moment it’s a battle for people to keep going.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis.

We need a better and more sophisticated policy response.”According to the CCDH research, Facebook took action on the greatest proportion of flagged posts on coronavirus, with one in 10 removed and a further 2 per cent flagged as false information.Instagram removed 4 per cent of posts and took down 6 per cent of the responsible accounts, with 10 per cent of posts acted on in total.Twitter only acted on 3.3 per cent of reported tweets, removing 2.8 per cent of accounts and 0.6 per cent of posts.In total, 9.4 per cent of the 649 reported posts were taken down inidually or as part of a wider profile or group.Army called in to help quash online coronavirus conspiracy theoriesThe research was conducted by volunteers from Youth Against Misinformation, a group trained by the Restless Development charity and the CCDH, from 20 April to 26 May.Twitter said its automated systems had removed 4.3 million “spammy or manipulative” accounts since new policies were introduced on 18 March.“We are introducing new labels and warning messages to provide additional context and information on some tweets containing disputed or misleading information related to Covid-19,” a statement added.Facebook, which owns Instagram, said that during March and April it placed warning labels on around 90 million pieces of content relating to coronavirus, and that people interacting with removed posts are notified.A spokesperson added: “We share the goal of reducing the spread of harmful misinformation about Covid-19, but this sample is not representative and the findings don’t reflect the work we’ve done.“We are taking aggressive steps to remove harmful misinformation from our platforms and have removed hundreds of thousands of these posts, including claims about false cures.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Felix Project has supplied 1,376 tons of produce since 23 March, the equivalent of 3,276,190 meals. This support has ameliorated the deep distress of those unable to afford or access food – in particular, families struggling below the breadline, NHS workers and the elderly.The sum raised from sales of Hirst’s rainbow butterfly hearts means that we are more than halfway to our goal of securing £10m for The Felix Project to help food-poor Londoners over the next three years. It is a pledge given added urgency by the latest jobless claims, which have surged to more than two million.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMore than 4,400 people backed our campaign by purchasing the Hirst limited edition prints – 3,109 bought the small size, costing £300 each, and 1,299 bought the large size, costing £1,000. The net proceeds amounted to £1.55m. Mr Hirst said: “It’s amazing to see how people have pulled together and helped each other during this crisis. I am so grateful to everyone who has helped me do my little bit and bought a butterfly heart edition – it’s turned out to be a brilliant communal way to help raise money for The Felix Project and support their important work across London.”How to support our campaignEvgeny Lebedev, shareholder in The Independent, said: “I have long believed in the power of art and this is a wonderful affirmation of that. With the support of Damien Hirst we have passed the halfway point in our mission to ensure no Londoner in any corner of the city goes hungry because of Covid.”Other substantial new donors to our campaign include management consultants McKinsey \u0026amp Company, whose employees voted to make our appeal partner their charity of choice.Olga Nefedova, associate partner, said: “We are making a donation to organisations helping our most vulnerable communities. The Felix Project is very much one of these organisations.”So far, more than six million meals have been delivered by the London Food Alliance – established in response to the coronavirus pandemic and made up of Felix, FareShare and City Harvest – of which over half have been supplied by The Felix Project.Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, paid tribute to the extraordinary all-round effort. “London was hit hard and fast – but oh, how it has stepped up and fought back,” he said. “We are inspired by the mobilisation of businesses, donors and supporters who have joined forces with our staff and volunteers.” The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

I feel so angry, isolated, desperate to talk to someone. I have been contacting people I lost touch with a long time ago, just to have someone to talk to.”Ms Olley, who is 73 and has no television and only last week bought a computer, said staying in her London home of 40 years was having an impact on her physically.“I am beginning to feel old,” she said. “I sit on the sofa and don’t move much, so you feel like an old lady. You see people out and about and you’re stuck inside. You want to go out but I have been feeling fearful about coronavirus because of my age. You see people outside and think, ‘How come they get to go out? Why can’t I?’”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFor many people over 70 who have been told to self-isolate, the pandemic has been a mental and physical challenge. For some, it has also meant extra anxiety of being unable to access food easily.Ms Olley has come to rely for her daily meals on a doughty little charity called Made in Hackney, a cookery school delivering food supplied by our appeal partner, The Felix Project. The charity supplies 500 nutritious meals a day to the borough’s most vulnerable and nearly half its beneficiaries are over 70. Although the service was due to stop on 17 June, it is fundraising so the team can continue.How to support our campaignShe added: “Knowing that someone would come to my house and see if I was dead or alive every day – it sounds bad, but it is reassuring. The volunteers have been wonderful. They ring you occasionally to check in as well.”Another Made in Hackney beneficiary is Nigel Howat, 79, a former sightseeing bus company boss who has lived in his Hackney housing association accommodation for more than 20 years.Due to his age, he sometimes struggles to breathe. He also has a gluten intolerance, with wheat products making him violently ill. While he has neighbours to chat to from a safe distance, he has been missing his family. His stepson, Darren, was recently diagnosed with lymphoid cancer.“He lives in Merton and I haven’t seen him since his diagnosis,” said Mr Howat. “Normally I would be there to support him, but that is impossible at the moment, so it’s been hard.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The charity suggests up to 2.4 million people aged 70 and over have difficulty with at least one element of daily living.Angus Wyllie, 72, from Barnet, has struggled with cooking and operating his iPad to keep in touch with his relatives.“I am more of a ‘put a ready meal in the oven’ kind of person,” he admitted. “My iPad packed up early into lockdown which meant I couldn’t contact people, or get deliveries.”He has benefited from the largesse of Katie-Louise Barber who has been cooking hundreds of meals from Felix-supplied produce out of her home in Barnet since the start of the pandemic. She delivers her food parcels across London every week and about half are to the elderly.Top chefs ‘rhyme for restaurants’ in support of our appealIt’s a laugh cooking with kids, says actor David MorrisseyHelp the Hungry tops £5.5m following successful Hirst heart sale“Katie has been a lifesaver,” Mr Wyllie said. “She has been delivering to a few neighbours including a family of three nearby who have been struggling.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

And aides later said that proxy voting rights would also be extended to all MPs over the age of 70.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpeaking during prime minister’s questions, Sir Keir said: “The scenes yesterday of MPs queueing to vote and members being unable to vote were frankly shameful.”Created with Sketch.How photographer captured baby image in coronavirus lockdown Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“If any other employer behaved like this it would be a clear and obvious case of indirect discrimination under Equalities Act. A clear and obvious case,” he added.His intervention came after Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, defended the government’s plan to end virtual voting – a system put in place in April during the the height of the coronavirus outbreak in the UK.Mr Rees-Mogg insisted those MPs shielding or self-isolating due to Covid-19 would be able to continue to participate in parliamentary debates and questions virtually, but said the practice of online voting would come to an end.During the first physical votes on Tuesday since ending the virtual parliament, MPs criticised “ludicrous scenes” and images that circulated on social media showing members in long queues stretching across the Palace of Westminster.Ress-Mogg faces backlash as government ends virtual voting for MPsIn his response to Sir Keir on Wednesday, Mr Johnson added: “He needs to consider what is going on throughout the country where ordinary people are getting used to queueing for long periods of time to do their shopping or whatever it happens to be.“I must say I do not think it unreasonable that we should ask parliamentarians to come back to this place and do their job. I know it’s difficult, I apologise to colleagues for the inconvenience.“I apologise to those with particular difficulties because they are shielding or they are elderly and it’s vital they should know the changes we are making today they should be able to vote by proxy.”In a statement published yesterday, the Equality and Human Rights Commission also wrote to all MPs warning the proposals to end remote voting will “place at significant disadvantage MPs who are shielding or self-isolating”.“It cannot be right for parliament to proceed without provision for remote participation when many elected representatives cannot attend in person,” they added.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We never faced the structural unemployment that we saw in the 1980s.Unemployment expected to be in double digits through November electionHe added that the Government must make sure unemployed workers do not end up on long-term benefits.The former Tory chancellor explained: Governments of all colours since the Second World War have not done terribly well at getting structurally unemployed people back into work.The pair were giving evidence alongside former Tory chancellor Philip Hammond, who said there were too many uncertainties to know how quickly and successfully the economy can recover.He said: A lot is going to depend whether over the next months it is clear that we are heading towards a vaccine or treatment for this disease and returning the economy to something like normal, or, by contrast, that we\u0027re not heading towards an early vaccine or a treatment and we have to plan, in terms of restarting the economy living with Covid - restructuring our businesses so they can operate in a sub-optimal way so they can operate with the disease.All three said the Government should not concern itself with the high levels of debt the UK is wracking up in the short term, avoid tax rises and consider tax cuts either through a VAT reduction or national insurance payments.Mr Hammond said there was no economic logic to increasing taxes in the short term.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They don’t write the show. So no need to attack them,” she said.She recently tweeted: To my black fans, I have now made it my purpose to fight for us.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.A former head of MI6 has said he believes the coronavirus pandemic may have “started as an accident”, with the virus escaping from a Chinese laboratory.Sir Richard Dearlove cited an “important” new study by British and Norwegian researchers which he thinks could “shift the debate”.The researchers claim to have discovered clues suggesting key elements were “inserted” into the virus’s genetic sequence and may not have evolved naturally —​ a prospect contested by almost every other scientist studying the virus’s makeup.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe study had been rejected by various journals and rewritten several times to remove accusatory claims about China before it was published in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics Discovery, according to The . Initial co-author John Fredrik Moxnes, a chief scientific adviser to the Norwegian military, reportedly asked for his name to be removed.The researchers are still seeking a publisher for a new paper, which The  reports says Covid-19 is a “remarkably well-adapted virus for human co-existence”, and claims it is likely to be the result of a laboratory experiment to produce “chimeric viruses of high potency”.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Amid attempts by Donald Trump to pile blame on China, repeatedly labelling Covid-19 the “Chinese virus”, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo claimed there was “enormous evidence” that the virus was man-made. He has since produced no such evidence.His remarks came after the US National Intelligence Director’s office said it “concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not man-made or genetically modified”, adding the intelligence community would continue to “rigorously examine” the possibility it had escaped from a laboratory.In the UK, health secretary Matt Hancock said the government has seen “no evidence” to suggest the virus originated in a laboratory.The scientific consensus has been that the virus originated in bats, with the genetic makeup of the virus indicating it most likely jumped naturally to an intermediate animal before making the leap to humans.The established theory is that the virus originated in a Wuhan wet market.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I think it will make every country in the world rethink how it treats its relationship with China and how the international community behaves towards the Chinese leadership.”No scientists studying Covid-19’s genetic makeup have reported signs it was manipulated, except for those in the study he cites, co-authored by Professor Angus Dalgleish, of St George’s at the University of London.With countries such as the US seeking to politicise the virus, the Wuhan Instite of Virology vice director in April denounced the claims as a malicious “conspiracy theory” designed to “confuse” people.“As people who carry out viral study, we clearly know what kind of research is going on in the institute and how the institute manages viruses and samples. As we said early on, there is no way this virus came from us,” Yuan Zhiming told state media.“We have a strict regulatory regime and code of conduct of research, so we are confident,” added Mr Zhiming, a biotechnology expert who has trained and worked in France, Denmark and the US.He told Reuters: “I hope everyone will put aside their prejudices and biases in order to provide a rational environment for research on tracing the origin of the virus.”Wuhan Institute of Virology\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Teaching trade unions — which want to keep schools closed for political reasons — have been breathing down their necks.But it was the right one.No time with teachers between mid-March and September would be educationally devastating for all children — but particularly those in poorer families.And with kids stuck at home millions of parents can’t go back to work.Yes, there’s an element of risk: it will always be impossible to guarantee the health of every single Brit.But top scientists have thrown their weight behind the Government’s decision, citing convincing evidence that children don’t play much of a role in the transmission of coronavirus.And with sensible social distancing measures in place, keeping classrooms safe should be eminently possible.Thousands of brilliant teachers are longing to get back to the job they love. Let’s hope for a full reopening ASAP.THE Government’s  day quarantine for Brits ing from abroad is half-baked, illogical — and could have catastrophic long-term consequences for this country.

Yes, the Prime Minister might feel uncomfortable singling out a specic town or city for draconian restrictions.But the economy must come before political niceties. And shutting down businesses in Cornwall because of a minor new outbreak in Newcastle would be economically bonkers.France — with a population comparable to the UK — introduced “red” and “green” zones when restrictions were first eased on May .

The entire show was given over to Dominic Cummings.None of it was funny, obviously. Have I Got News For You hasn’t been funny in years.What still slightly surprised me, however, was that they chose to believe every single negative story the Press had written about him, last week, including some of the stuff which, like the police hauling him in for questioning, was clearly a load of cobblers.Quite a contrast to the previous week when, based on one Mail on Sunday story, host Charlie Brooker asked: “Why do you think the Press has got it in for Keir Starmer ”Apart from the fact the entire Press hasn’t got it in for him , it’s the question’s assumption that gives the game away here.The BBC and HIGNFY have already decided Keir Starmer is great and will not tolerate any dissent.I’m grateful for it anyway, as it shines a light on the dumb equation that’s come to govern this show: Have I Got News For You believes every bad word written about the Government and disbelieves every bad word written of the Opposition.If a satirical show is stupid enough to put every politician it agrees withoff limits, it’s guaranteed to fail, which is why HIGNFY’s time has come and long gone and it deserves to be jettisoned as quickly as possible.For that to happen, though, the BBC would need to dismount its high horse, admit errors and bias and change its political culture entirely.So expect it to keep coming back.

They have croissants.”The real grit in the oyster, however, was actress Britt Ekland who, apart from those moments when she was chasing after multi-millionaire Duncan, always gave the impression she’d rather set fire to her own Wicker Man than spend one more second in India.Would she finally be converted to the idea, the last episode of the series asked, by spending a night at a luxury retirement complex, in the foothills of the Himalayas, with Henry Blofeld and Paul Chuckle Well, Britt arrived like a dry cough in the morning, but  hours later . . .“This is my ultimate hell.

Yet now the rate is going down we are going to start doing so.This will seem perverse to the millions of us who have complied with ­lockdown laws while seeing planes arrive from highly infected nations.While we are effectively ­closing our borders, other nations are loosening their restrictions and opening up their markets to foreign travel.Many British companies have offices and subsidiaries overseas but the bosses of those firms won’t be able to visit their foreign-based business centres because they will face a two-week quarantine upon their .It gives totally the wrong impression to the world.The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, had rightly ­campaigned for Brexit on the basis that Britain would be an outward-looking nation. That won’t be possible with international travel curtailed.Travellers will want to be reassured that airlines are ­taking measures to counter the spread of the virus, so ­temperature checks could be put into place at UK airports.That would tell the authorities which passengers have symptoms of the virus.It would be better than the two-week quarantine, which would only prolong a terrible ­nightmare for the British ­tourism industry upon which so many livelihoods depend. Around  per cent of the ­British workforce — four ­million people — have jobs either in or linked to tourism in this country.The industry is worth £billion to the economy but since lockdown it has stalled.The winter months are quiet, the spring has been spent in lockdown and the summer months are the most crucial.When the Government’s­ ­furlough scheme comes to an end, businesses will face some very tough ­choices.I am concerned about my ,-strong workforce and the last thing I would want to do is lay off staff.

Conventional wisdom about sound money and financial prudence has disappeared.Until recently the enemies of socialism, the Conservatives have now become converts to government action.Mrs Thatcher famously talked about “rolling back the frontiers of the state.”Now, in the wake of the Covid crisis, they have come sweeping forward once more.In the process, the public finances have taken a battering.In April the Government borrowed over £billion, a larger sum than for the whole of .The fiscal deficit is now projected to reach no less than £billion, perhaps even £billion in the worst case scenario.At the same time, more than million people — more than half the entire national workforce — are effectively on the state payroll.Even as lockdown eases, much of the economy has now been taken into the custody of the state.All this has to be paid for — and the bills cannot be met simply by printing more money.That is the route to a debased currency, soaring interest rates and hyperinflation.The reality is that massive state intervention is simply not sustainable except in an emergency.If printing money were the recipe for prosperity, then Zimbabwe would be the richest country on earth rather than mired in poverty.That is the lesson of history.If the Government carries on spending and intervening on a level that would have even made Jeremy Corbyn blush, then our country will be in real danger of sliding back to the dark days of the s.Gripped by industrial unrest and economic decline, Britain then was known as the “sick man of Europe”.Because of extravagant spending, the public finances were in a desperate state. In  inflation reached  per cent.The following year, Britain’s deficit was so enormous that the Government humiliatingly had to ask for a £.billion handout from the IMF.With the economy limping from one crisis to another, taxes soared, with the top rate on “unearned income” reaching  per cent.Some of the revenue was swallowed up in bailouts of troubled companies.In  the engine and car maker Rolls-Royce was rescued, followed by the Upper Clyde shipbuilders in  and volume motor manufacturer British Leyland in .Indeed, this was an era of institutionalised bullying by the strike-happy trade unions, who held the Government and the nation to ransom by flexing their industrial muscle.When Sir Horace Cutler, the Tory leader of the Greater London Council in the late s, was asked how many people work for London Transport, he replied, “about half of them.”In , which saw the Winter of Discontent, no fewer than million working days were lost to stoppages.At the peak of the disruption, bodies were left unburied and rubbish piled high in the street.The very fabric of society appeared to be falling part.“There is madness in the air,” recorded Bernard Donoghue, an aide to the Prime Minister Jim Callaghan.It was precisely the public’s revulsion at failed socialism and trade union irresponsibility that brought Margaret Thatcher to power in  on a  of reviving the economy.She achieved it by taming the unions, reinvigorating enterprise, restoring the work ethic and shrinking the Government.We need the same again today. All the good work of the last four decades will be undonewe slide back into the dependency culture, headed by a sprawling, sclerotic state machine.The only sure foundation on which to build a lasting recovery is by the wealth creation of the private sector.In practice that means the Government’s priority must be to encourage commerce and competition, not to dish out subsidies.So businesses should be urged to re-open as soon as possible, backed up by reductions in corporation tax and rates.Barriers to growth, like the strict social distancing limits, should be lted.At the same time, the Government should drop its plans to impose heavy-handed rules on quarantine for all travellers to Britain.It is a policy that will do nothing to protect public health but will cause huge damage to the economy, especially the travel industry.Similarly, Britain’s highly flexible labour market — the engine of the job creation miracle since  — must be maintained in the face of demands for more regulations.The best support that the Government can provide is not bailouts and bureaucracy, but a dynamic business environment along with a strong civic infrastructure, including modernised transport links and improved broadband.Soon after he became Prime Minister in , Jim Callaghan said: “We used to think we could spend our way out of recession. I tell you in all candour, that option no longer exists.”Under siege from inflation and the unions, his government was unable to abide by those sensible words.But as we come out of lockdown, their truth is more important than ever.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ofc its smiley face. Because Louis Tomlinson is really important person in my le and..i just need to know that Im not alone. So..here we go!One newcomer to stick and poke is staying abreast of the trend by inking this female form on her friends bottom.She wrote: I’m slowly getting better! Also tried tattooing with a tattoo pen today! Tbh I like the feeling of stick and poke much better! I feel more connected to the person.A dog lover with a sausage dog named Loaf used his home poke skills to create a permanent tribute, which he called Bad Loaf.A little bit of nature is a must when living in lockdown and reddit user Kinaglos took her inspiration from the poppy fields of Calornia.This barbed wire design is based on a logo a reference to anime Cowboy Bebop, and was the home design of Twitter user Myled.He wrote: I did a tattoo and it made me happy.If you let your friends loose on your back, you had better trust them with your le.This design was posted on reddit with the caption, Healed trippy face I did on a friend.Dont stare at it too long - it will freak you out.While the online kits may be safe, doctors warn that any unsterilized needle could cause painful skin infections, Hepatitis C and HIV.In a recent NHS video, Dr Rob Hicks said: “The potential health risks that come from having a tattoo that people ought to be considering beforehand obviously is the issue of contaminated equipment, equipment that is contaminated with infections, so Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV.“These are the major things that anybody considering having a tattoo should think about beforehand and be aware off.”Sepsis.org recently advised against home tattoo kits, adding: “The inks have been associated with infections and allergic reactions and the agency is concerned that tattoos done at home may not follow all infection-prevention strategies.”It may be proving tricky to find love in lockdown but one Simpsons fan has found a novel way of approaching the problem.After inking this tattoo he posted online with the caption, Big simple, tryna get we. Doh!A cat lover gave reddit readers paws for though with this cute little kitty design.He wrote: Done yesterday! All hand poked.Whether this home artist was offering advice to angry trolls or a keen cook, she could also have been talking to her own skin.After hours working on that design it must have burned.For a first effort, this fern design is in pretty good shape.The reditter it belongs to posted it with the message: First poke,  hours old. An experiment to see how light and how close I can go... might heal to a blob.It cant be easy to tattoo a heart design as tiny as this with a stick and poke kit.But at least when the tattoo parlour opens, it will be easy to colour in.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And Britain has been very good at it.But as we slowly move out of lockdown with thoughts of shopping, seeing our friends and family, and a cool drink in a pub garden, how effective this two-metre rule actually is has become a new national obsession.Many are starting to ask: Do we really need to keep a two-metre gap  Could it in fact be ONE metre  It may sound trivial, a metre is still too far to hug, kiss, even to shake hands with friends and loved ones.But for many businesses which rely on allowing people to gather more closely — theatres, restaurants, pubs, to name but a few — cutting the official social distance in half could be the dference between keeping afloat or going under.The official advice of the World Health Organization is that one metre is sufficient, a belief shared by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.The Danes changed their position three weeks ago to one metre and most of the European countries’ public health officials advise one metre in certain circumstances.Now a new study by the WHO has found that while a two-metre distance reduced the risk of the virus being passed on to . per cent, a one-metre gap only increased the chance of transmission to . per cent.So a small risk either way, but enough to justy potentially endangering some of the industries we both enjoy and, for many thousands, rely upon for work. I have been asking for a couple of months how that distance was established, yet its origins are very obscure.It seems to go back to research on the distance between beds in the old-fashioned Nightingale wards in the s. It has become a folklore of infection control and public health, until people have started asking questions about it today.Experiments about the distance droplets travel have been conducted under such articial conditions that they are not applicable to everyday lives.Laboratory air is articially still, whereas air is not still, even when you are sitting in a room with all the windows and doors closed. Air flow breaks up the particles from a sneeze or a cough and they tend to fall pretty quickly on to your clothes or face.The serious risk of infection is when you get up to half a metre away from somebody with Covid- who sneezes or coughs.But the dference between one metre and two metres is the dference between a very small risk and a very tiny risk.To the economy, the dference is a radical one. Shting from two metres to one metre would allow us to get back to something close to business as usual. If you imagine a two-metre circle drawn around any inidual, that takes up  and a half square metres.When you come down to a one-metre safe zone, it is only . square metres. So you could get four times as many people into any given space. With the two-metre rule,  per cent of pubs and bars say it wouldn’t be economically viable to reopen. With four times as many customers, only small pubs would face dficulties.The current approach doesn’t grasp that town centres are leisure destinations and that people won’t go outit is an unpleasant experience. Shoppers want to have a coffee, lunch, try on clothes, it is a social activity with their friends.I believe that cinemas are safe to reopen and that perhaps we might be able to allow some fans back into football stadiums to cheer on their teams again.In a typical cinema, where seating is tiered and there is air conditioning,you do happen to be coughing out, the thermal heat from the bodies should rise it up out into the air conditioning system.Allowing fans to attend football matches again would be a challenge, because of the congestion going into the stadium.They would have to carefully plan entrance and exit times and leave every other seat vacant unless there is a family group, so you would probably be playing in front of a stadium which is  per cent full.I may be part of a faction that favours one metre, but the consensus is that the risk of transmission outside is very low.So joggers don’t have to go into the road to avoid getting too close to someone  on the pavement — because their slipstream will mean the droplets will probably stick to them anyway.The best way to reduce the risk of the virus spreading is a good standard of hygiene, sanitising your hands at the end of a journey and after eating.If you are involved in a lot of customer interactions, such as supermarket checkouts, Perspex barriers are helpful.The Government has taken so much flak on easing lockdown restrictions that they seem to be reluctant to get into a fight on this one. But we need to remember that interrupting the transmission of the virus is not about rules and their enforcement.It is about assessing the risk at each inidual venue, because sticking to two metres in all cases poses a risk to our economic health.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It had been trashed, with broken stuff like computers all over the place.We found a bin bag and inside were wigs and exotic clothing, whether just fancy dress or something stranger I couldnt tell.Maddie disappeared from her holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, while her parents Kate and Gerry enjoyed tapas with their friends nearby.When Kate ed to check on Maddie and her twin siblings Sean and Amelie at around pm in the evening evening, she discovered the youngster was not in her bed.Despite a -year search for the missing girl and countless conspiracy theories and potential suspects, no trace of Madeleine – who would now be  – has ever been found.In September , Gerry and Kate, both doctors, were sensationally named as arguidos by Portuguese police - which translates as more than a witness, but who has not been arrested or charged.The following summer the McCanns were cleared by investigators in Portugal who declared they had exhausted all avenues in the case.Ex-Portuguese police chief Goncalo Amaral then penned a bombshell book in  claiming that Kate and Gerry had accidentally killed their daughter then covered up the death.The book, The Truth of the Lie, led to years of legal wrangling between the desperate couple and ex-cop that led to British police officers picking up the case.The Met was given an extra £, last year to explore a number of outstanding leads identied during its Operation Grange investigation.The initial Portuguese investigation failed to make any headway and at one point even wrongly declared her parents, Kate and Gerry arguidoes, or persons of interest.Scotland Yard then launched its own investigation into Madeleines disappearance in  and initially had  full time officers working on the case.It is now a team of four cops, led by Det Chief Insp Mark Cranwell, and is continuing the efforts into finding the, now teenage, Madeline.During the investigation police said they had looked at more than  persons of interest and had made inquiries about the whereabouts of  sex offenders.Confirming the extra funding last year, a Home Office spokesman said: All applications for Special Grant funding are considered carefully on their inidual merits, however, decisions are made in batches to allow us to better consider the impact on the overall policing budget.Due to this, the next round of Special Grant funding will not be decided until October, however we have written to Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime in the meantime with assurance that the politan Police Service will receive a similar level of funding for Operation Grange for   as it did for the previous year.The local probe into her suspected kidnapping was axed in  and Scotland Yard launched Operation Grange in .Costs soon spiralled into the millions as  officers were dispatched to investigate the youngsters disappearance.The entire cost has now topped £million - with a further £, pledged by the Home Office last year to continue the investigation.So far, police have looked at more than  persons of interest and made inquiries as to the whereabouts of  sex offenders.There have been a number of potential suspects named by local media and police that have come to nothing - piling more anguish on Maddies parents.Amaral last year sparked speculation notorious child killer Martin Ney was a prime suspect after revealing investigators were focusing on a German paedo in prison.But he ruled the strangler out in an interview on Spanish TV after being shown a photo of Ney.“A paedophile who is German and serving le for killing children has been spoken about,” he told a show about missing adults and children.“What I know is that the suspect is not him, it’s another man. He’s also in prison in Germany. He’s also a paedophile.”Maddies parents have never given up hope they will find out what happened to their daughter in the agonising -year search.The couple, from Rothley, Leics, said they were driven by an almost feral reaction as they carried out a desperate search for their daughter on the night she vanished.They have been the subject of backlash and had the finger pointed at them but their Catholic faith has never been shaken as they poured their energy into the search.The couple have launched numerous appeals and seen millions in taxpayer money poured into the investigation to no avail.Kate, who stopped working as a GP after the horror, is an ambassador for the Missing People charity and regularly campaigns for children who have vanished.Her husband still works as a professor of cardiac imaging at the University of Leicester, and a consultant cardiologist.Gerry has bravely opened up about his mental health struggles since the night Madeleine went missing.In , the McCanns said they had managed to adjust to a new normality of being a family-of-four, with their focus on giving the twins a very normal, happy and fulfilling le.Speaking to the BBC on the -year anniversary of her daughters disappearance, Kate said: We had some excellent advice early on. We have been as open with them as we can.We have told them about things and that people are writing things that are simply just untrue and they need to be aware of that.The couple say they have seen the worst and the best of human nature since the campaign to find their daughter thrust them into the spotlight.But they have refused to shy away from public appeals as they continue the desperate hunt for information.In , Kate even heartbreakingly revealed she continued to buy birthday and Christmas presents for Madeleine.Last Christmas, a message on the official Find Madeleine Facebook page, said nothing has changed.As they faced their th Christmas without their daughter, the couple added: We love her, we miss her, we hope as always.The search for Madeleine goes on with unwavering commitment.DCI Cranwell said: “It’s more than  years since Madeleine went missing and none of us can imagine what it must be like for her family, not knowing what happened or where she is.“Following the ten-year anniversary, the Met received information about a German man who was known to have been in and around Praia da Luz. We have been working with colleagues in Germany and Portugal and this man is a suspect in Madeleine’s disappearance.Our job as detectives is to follow the evidence, maintain an open mind and establish what happened on that day in May .“Please contact us without delay so we can get answers for Madeleine’s family.”A list of sightings from each of the  countries - nearly all of which have been labelled NFA or No Further Action.Most serious were the alleged sightings in the hours and days following Madeleines disappearance.On the night she was taken, police received two separate potential sightings from members of the public - however one was fully ruled out as being a holidaymaker with his daughter.There were six reported sightings between May -, , in Portugal, including CCTV footage that showed a girl matching Maddies description with two men and a woman at a petrol station in the town of Nelas.Over the border in Spain, there have been three reported sightings but all were ruled out, along with eight major alleged sightings in Morocco.There were as many as  in Malta in the month after the toddlers disappearance which led to the capital Valletta being briefly locked down.One of the most serious potential sightings in Amsterdam was revealed when Portuguese police released their case files in August .It showed a girl of blonde girl of Madeleines age and description told a shopkeeper her name was Maddie and she had been taken from mummy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She also took a swipe at Kate for crafting a “posher” accent after being born a commoner.And she sneered at the influence mum Carole Middleton, , is believed to have had on Kate and William’s Norfolk home, making it “very Buckingham- shire”.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"As the royal couple take legal action against Tatler for alleged “inaccuracies and  misrepresentations”, senior courtiers directly pointed the finger at Meghan, , for influencing the piece.The tone of the article would have come as a major shock to Kate as the magazine — loved as much by the hunting and shooting set as Made In Cha stars — has previously championed her as a society icon.And we can reveal that editor Richard is an old friend of hers from St Andrews University — and even went on holiday with her twice. Tonight, a source told The Sun: “Kate remains hurt and upset by the article. It was very unpleasant. But she also feels betrayed, as Richard had been a friend from the St Andrews set. Kate never saw this coming.“There are a lot of unanswered questions, particularly who said these things to Tatler because her real friends would never talk that way about her.”William, , did not get away unscathed, with a deeply personal and patronising jibe that he sees mother-in-law Carole as “the mummy he always wanted”.The description of fitness fanatic Kate being “perilously thin” is believed to have shocked the whole family. While there were also claims that \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Meghan and Kate fell out over whether Princess Charlotte, five, could wear tights to Meghan and Harry’s  wedding — a row that is said to have left Kate in tears.A Kensington Palace spokesman complained: “This story contains a swathe of inaccuracies and  misrepresentations which were not put to Kensington Palace prior to publication.”Tatler’s reply poured more fuel on the fire. It said “Editor-in-chief Richard Dennen stands behind the reporting of Pasternak and her sources.“Kensington Palace knew we were running the ‘Catherine the Great’ cover months ago and we asked them to work together on it. The fact they are denying they ever knew is categorically .”Kensington Palace has now filed legal action and asked for the story to be removed from its website.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Tatler responded saying the legal complaint “has no merit”.The brazen reply stunned palace sources and sparked fears Meghan — whose friends have previously been caught going to the Press — had a hand in the article.Chicago-born Dennen, known as Tricky Dickie, was a close pal of Kate’s from her days at university. They were on the same art history course there, lived two streets away and even went to France together in  while Kate was taking a relationship break from William.They were so close he shared a cheeky photo he took of her at an airport eating a sandwich, with the caption: “Before le got serious and we still ate wheat and flew economy.” The Instagram post has since been deleted.It is also believed he was a guest at her  wedding and both receptions.Dennen has said of Kate: “She’s very measured, very controlled.“That is perfect because you don’t want someone who’s going to be falling out on the Kings Road face down, wasted after a boozy session. There was this nightclub that everyone went to called Boujis and she was famous for always nipping into the bathroom, checking her hair and make-up before she left because she knew there were photographers waiting outside.”The editor claims he has only met William once or twice.The author behind the piece, however, has form for upsetting the Firm.Pasternak, who is known for airing royal laundry in public, made her name with the racy  book Princess In Love.Compared at the time to a Mills  Boon novel, it told the story of Princess Diana’s love affair with Captain James Hewitt and was published when William was aged just .She has also written a book on American socialite orcée Wallis Simpson — whose love affair with King Edward VIII led to him giving up the throne — and a newspaper article headlined, “To stop history repeating, Meghan must learn from Wallis Simpson”.But the real finger of suspicion has led to the US after \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"The Sun revealed that Vanessa Mulroney, the sister-in-law of Meghan’s close pal Jessica Mulroney, once worked for Tatler and still has friends there.Meghan has previously been accused of asking Jessica to intervene in stories to ensure a more “favourable” slant.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Meghan herself is currently suing The Mail on Sunday over its printing of a private letter from her to her father Thomas, .In its defence, the newspaper claims Meghan has enlisted friends to intervene quietly in stories to get her side across.Five of Meghan’s friends famously briefed People magazine on her behalf, including telling it about her letter to her dad.Meghan also got Jessica to intervene in a story to put pressure on a former business adviser to ensure “a more favourable article”.In legal documents in the High Court, The Mail on Sunday says it will seek disclosure from Meghan on “any other occasions in which the Claimant has caused or permitted her friends to provide information about her to the media”. Predictably, as the royals sued Tatler this week, Meghan’s friends leapt to her defence. A close pal accused Kensington Palace of “pulling out all the stops” to protect Kate while leaving her and Harry high and dry — in a billionaire’s mansion in LA.Protected or not, the damage for Kate has already been done.Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine, said: “This story is not going away, which I am sure she would prefer it to.“But the article is not something you’d like to read about yourself.“It was very Tatleresque. Built up in order to knock her down. It is not fair to say someone is exhausted.“It was critical of her work and she takes her work very seriously.

Here, Radio  presenter Clara Amfo, London mayoral hopeful Shaun Bailey and Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu give their thoughts on protests around the world. AT Radio  we talk a lot about mental health, and the truth is mine was in a really bad way this weekend. In-fact it has been for the past few days, following the death of George Floyd.George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died whilst being held under arrest.I didn’t have the mental strength to do my show on Monday, and to say to listeners ‘Hey, how was your weekend ’ with my usually happy intention – because I know that my weekend was terrible.I was sat on my sofa crying, angry and confused, as I sat watching the news of yet another brutalised black body.I know how the world enjoys blackness, and then I see what happened to George.We black people get the feeling the people want our culture but they do not want us. In other words, you want my talent, but you don’t want me.There is a  idea that racism, and in this case anti-blackness, is just name calling and physical violence when it’s so much more insidious than that.One of my favourite thinkers is a woman called Amanda Seel, and I feel it deeply when she says you cannot enjoy the rhythm and ignore the blues.I want to say to people, I hope you feel what you have seen and heard today – that it reaches you, and that you respond to it.And to those of you who already let me know that you are doing the work to be committed to doing better, I see you. So let’s do this.Let’s all be anti-racist.GEORGE Floyd’s death has resonated in Britain because it feels like it is happening to the black community.The pain, anger and distrust incidents of police brutality breed are incredible.Stop and search is a powerful police tool, but we should stop everybody or nobody. The police stop and search black people far more and they get a  positive — finding more black criminals. It is important for everyone, black or white, that our justice system works.The report into the disproportionate number of BAME deaths from Covid- highlights how we need those communities to make the country work.The lack of opportunity for black people is a problem for all,we want everyone to prosper we need to stop looking at their colour. I’d ask people to look in their lives and ask how they could level the playing field.You can’t give equality of outcome to all but equality of opportunity should be for all.WHEN a handcuffed man with a policeman kneeling on his neck dies after shouting “Help me, I have no breath”, people say enough’s enough.Two officers just looked on at George Floyd’s plight.Martin Luther King Jnr said violence creates more problems than it solves.Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.The US hasn’t been listening to the real problems of African Americans.No government has dealt with the brutality they experience from people in ­unorm. Since the murder of Stephen Lawrence some strides have been made here. But it must be consistent all the time.If a protest turns into violence I don’t believe that’s the same as protesting.I’d certainly want to join a protest. But I’m self- ­shielding. I hope people don’t go into crowds.

The cause of death is asphyxia compression of the neck and back.Baden said he wished his arteries were as good as Floyds, and said that what those officers did that we see on this video is that cause of his death, not some underlying, unknown health condition.The family attorney said: What you see on the video is exactly what happened. Those police officers were the proximate cause of George Floyds death.Floyd was arrested by four officers, who of whom was caught on video holding his knee on the back of Floyds neck for nearly nine minutes.The criminal complaint said the autopsy “revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation, which prompted Floyds family to conduct an independent report.Minnesota’s Attorney General has since announced that they will escalate charges against Chauvin and charge the three other officers with aiding and abetting in Floyds murder.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

 metres away.When Kate ed to check on the kids at around pm that evening, she discovered that Madeleine was not in her bed and was missing.In September of that year, Gerry and Kate, both doctors, were sensationally named as ‘arguidos’ by Portuguese police.The following summer the McCanns were cleared by investigators in Portugal who declared they had exhausted all avenues in the case.Madeleine would have turned  on on May , .In April , UK cops released a computer generated image of Madeleine showing what she would look like aged nine.However, her parents said those images of Madeleines age progression are bogus. Kate and Gerry warned the new fake images were neither commissioned nor endorsed by them or Scotland Yard’s Operation Grange team.A number of potential leads have emerged since the little girl vanished, but none amounted to anything and no arrests have ever been made.In May , witness Jane Tanner said Gerry had played tennis with a man wrongly identied as her abductor on the day she went missing.She said she spent up to half an hour watching Gerry McCann and Dr Julian Totman, , play on May , .Less than three hours later, she saw a man carrying a child in pyjamas near the McCanns’ apartment in Praia da Luz.But she did not recognise Dr Totman and cops pursued the lead for four years, despite the GP saying it was probably him.There have been more than , potential sightings of the Brit three-year-old since her disappearance, but police have so far failed to locate her.politan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said there are signicant investigative avenues that are of great interest to both the UK and Portuguese teams pursuing the case.Met cops believe she was stolen by child traffickers or sex fiends, or during a burglary gone wrong.Meanwhile, cops are now hunting a person of signicance in a shock new development.A source close to Scotland Yards search Operation Grange said the person is now a critical line of inquiry in the £million investigation, according to The Times.And a former Met police chief has called for a fresh interview with Madeleines parents and the Tapas Seven - who have never been quizzed by British cops.Cops moved the search to Bulgaria as they tried to find a woman in purple they wanted to speak to.On May , , it emerged that Portuguese police were hunting a sex fiend who speaks English and wears a surgical mask in relation to Madeleines suspected kidnapping.In one of his previous cases, he broke into a British familys home and loomed over a seven-year-old girl who woke up and asked Is that you Daddy  and he replied Yes in a foreign accent, author Anthony Summers said in the Netflix doc.Detectives have discovered a creep carried out nearly  attacks within a -mile radius of the holiday apartment in Praia da Luz where Madeleine vanished from  years ago.He crept into Algarve properties rented by families and many victims were British.And a judicial source is reported to have confirmed the unnamed man was definitely in Portugal at the time the three-year-old suddenly disappeared.And the insider also alleged he was known to local cops and had previously been investigated on suspicion of involvement in paedophile cases.A chilling reconstruction features in the final episode of Netflixs eight-part documentary The Disappearance Of Madeleine McCann.A German paedophile Martin Ney, , emerged as a key suspect in May .He was jailed for le in  for abducting and murdering three children and sexually abusing dozens more.It is believed he was in Portugal when Madeleine went missing.Goncalo Amaral, the Portuguese cop who first led the hunt for Madeleine, revealed that police were probing a “German paedophile who is in prison”.Ney was working for an evangelical church on a project for the homeless in Portugal when Madeleine disappeared, its claimed.Ney also looks like a photofit of a man, who was seen acting suspiciously before Madeleine vanished from her Portuguese holiday apartment  years ago.Funding for the search was due to expire in October .But on September , , it was confirmed investigators have received £, to keep the probe alive until March .Then more funding - said to be around £, - was granted in March .The extra cash for Operation Grange is being used to investigate signicant leads, which Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley described as very worthwhile.Kate and and Gerry are “extremely thankful to both the Home Office and Scotland Yard for the continued funding,” their spokesman Clarence Mitchell said.The Home Office announced it was ploughing more money into Operation Grange, the official investigation, at the latest request of Met Police.In June  it was confirmed that the politan Police were asking the Home Office for more funding to continue the work of Operation Grange.Scotland Yards investigation has been ongoing since .During that time the number of detectives working on the case was cut from  to four in .The Home Office said in June  that the previous year saw it provide “£, of funding to the MPS. “The cost of Operation Grange to date is £.m.”Those still involved with the investigation are now said to spend a lot of their time eliminating known sex offenders and chasing down potential witnesses.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Year on year DNA is getting better. Year on year other techniques, including facial recognition, are getting better.The documentary also claimed Madeleine was likely to have been kept alive by child traffickers because, as a middle-class British girl, she would be more financially valuable.Madeleine would now be  years old.She was born May , , and went missing a little more than a week before her fourth birthday.Authorities are also hopeful that social media could help find Maddie, using her distinctive eyes to examine photographs on Facebook.Prior to the th anniversary of her disappearance, the McCanns said in an update on their FindMadeleine website: It is now  years since we were last with Madeleine. Her th birthday is to follow in the next couple of weeks... the latter tangibly, painfully, bringing it home to us what we have missed and continue to miss as a family.The investigation to find Madeleine remains open and continues, even though, in a way dferent to the ideal. We remain grateful for the ongoing efforts and commitment from all those involved in the search to find her and we hope and pray, as always, that our efforts will be fruitful.Thank you to everyone still offering their support and good wishes for Madeleine and ourselves. Such solidarity continues to strengthen us.Her mum, Kate, , has previously said: “I do all the present buying. I think about what age she is and buy something that, whenever we find her, will still be appropriate so there’s a lot of thought goes into it.”Madeleine was three, nearly four, when she went missing from her familys holiday flat in Portugal on May , .Her parents, Gerry and Kate McCann, had left her sleeping with her siblings while they had dinner at the hotels restaurant - only realising about pm that she was gone.The couple have since devoted their lives to finding the little girl - now left with the little girls Cuddle Cat as one of the last reminders of Maddie.More than £million has been poured into the investigation for her since .Searches have taken place in a few dferent countries as cops hope to find new evidence - including a search in Bulgaria.In January  the body of Kevin Halligen was found at his Surrey home - he had taken on the high-profile case in March , before his contract was terminated.In November , cops in Portugal said they were re-examining a theory that Madeleine left the apartment to find her parents.Police released an image of what Madeleine McCann would look like at the age of nine.With her distinctive right eye, the image shows the young girls face aged about six years from previous photographs.Kate still spends precious moments each day in Madeleine’s bedroom, where her dolls and teddies are on display, along with a growing number of presents.The mum said she could never ignore Madeleine’s birthday and the family “still celebrates her being part of our lives”.She also told how she jumps from seeing her eldest child as she was when she was kidnapped to envisaging her as she would be now.Maddie had been due to attend De Lisle College in neighbouring Loughborough and the school is still holding a place for her.Maddies family have begged people not to feed trolls online, instead urging people to let the vile commenters “starve for attention”.Supporters of the McCann family slammed trolls who “feed on havoc and causing chaos” – saying anyone involved would be banned from the official Find Madeleine Campaign page.In a note, the page stated: “Please don’t post your opinion on leaving children alone.“Doing so will result in you being banned. No questions asked.”The page claried that banning was not done “on a whim”, but that the page was designed to support the family, and nothing .The post, written by the unnamed webmaster, added: “This is not a place for you to post your negative opinions about the McCann family.“We are not a debate page nor a place to analyse the investigation.“This is a support and information page for Madeleine’s family and the Official Find Madeleine Campaign .”The official page is not run by the McCanns, but has received their support.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Tory Cabinet ministeraposs spokesperson said tonight he began to feel unwell in the House of Commons chamber when in the chamber delivering the second reading of the Corporate Governance and Insolvency Bill. In line with guidance he has been tested for coronavirus and is ing home to self-isolate, she added. Sharma was understood to be travelling home to self-isolate after he struggled during the speech at the despatch box today. A House of Commons spokeswoman said additional cleaning had taken place following the suspected case of Covid-. The development came a day after MPs approved the Governmentaposs plan to end virtual voting in the Commons. During the debate, he was seen wiping his face with a handkerchief several times and appeared to struggle. His opposite number in Labouraposs shadow cabinet, Ed Miliband, passed him a glass of water at one point, as did a Government whip. Labour shadow minister Toby Perkins had raised concerns over Mr Sharmaaposs appearance in the Commons earlier in the day. This is not ok. If he has symptoms that could be Covid-, itaposs not up to him to soldier on, he is jeopardising the health of everyone who he comes across and everyone  who touches that despatch box and every door handle he touches etc, Mr Perkins tweeted.  Maybe heaposs had a test and knows itaposs not that, butso he should confirm that to people watching, otherwise the message again goes out that what the government says and means about what to doyou have symptoms are two dferent things. If Mr Sharma has contracted coronavirus in Westminster, it would be a sad vindication of the fury felt by many members of parliament at being forced back to the Houses of Commons in person amid the coronavirus pandemic. MPs tonight reacted with anger at the news tonight.  MP for Liverpool Walton and shadow financial secretary Dan Carden said: Rees-Mogg’s insistence on physical voting in parliament puts lives at risk and will spread the virus. It cannot be allowed to continue. MP for Oxford West and Abingdon Layla Moran tweeted: Get well soon Alok Sharma. I really hope it is not Covid-.  MPs and staff will have been put at risk by the Government decision to not keep virtual Parliament. And in turn constituents, should he or anyone , test positive. Bring back virtual proceedings now! Labour MP for Newcastle North Catherine McKinnell wrote: He really didn’t look well, and I hope he’s OK.  He should not have been in the commons today. In fact, most of us shouldn’t have been. The Govt is advising everyone  to avoid public transport and work from homeposs to avoid spreading Covid, but made us all do the opposite. MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark Neil Coyle wrote that Sharma was in that irresponsible and unnecessary queue yesterday.  Rees-Mogg took a huge and completely avoidable risk and it has backfired badly. Johnson must not take the same approach with whole country. SNP MP for for Livingston Hannah Bardell said: This is very worrying. Hope Alok is better soon. Meantime, Jacob Rees Mogg needs to clarity his comments as he said evenmembers have Covid they can still attend Parliament. That is just utter madness. The Tory plan was approved last night by  to ,after a farcical and discriminatory socially-distanced vote - that forced MPs to queue for more than half a kilometre through Parliament.  In bizarre scenes, a snaking line of MPs passed out of the Commons chamber, looped round and round th Century Westminster Hall, out into a yard guarded by armed police, down theof a Victorian-era colonnade, under a main road, back up into a new-build office block and round a corner. As MPs compared the farce to Alton Towers, Plaid Cymruaposs Liz Savile Roberts declared it the world’s worst fairground attraction queue. Labour branded the vote farcical and discriminatory. Yet Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg claimed it is important for votes to be physical - and refused to back down from the barmy new scheme.  Labouraposs Charlotte Nichols posted a photo of a clogged bottleneck in a Parliamentary underpass. She tweeted: Social distancing for the vote going spectacularly badly, what a joke. MP Barbara Keeley added on Monday: In forcing theof Parliament, Boris Johnson risks sending a dangerous message to bad employers. The Speaker has said that MPs will be unable to vote safely - the current plan for theis unworkable.

Lives and livelihoods depend on the Government getting this judgement right. Instead of treading carefully Boris Johnson has adopted a scattergun approach, sowing confusion at a time when people needed clarity. Keir Starmer is correct to say the Prime Minister appears to be winging it. The lockdown has been eased even though the alert level remains at stage  which means there is still a high risk of contagion. Downing Street says it is being guided by its own five tests but its own document says these tests “must be warranted by the alert level”. Schools have been allowed to reopen even though the medical advice was for the test and trace system to be fully operational. This is clearly not the case when contact tracers say they are spending their time watching Netflix. Mr Johnson today said he was proud of the Government’s response.  How many more deaths will it take before he feels any shame  Time to listen The murder of George Floyd has once again shone a spotlight on America’s treatment of its black community. Across the world there has been revulsion at police brutality and the way African Americans continue to be victims of discrimination. While Britain can claim to have a better record on race relations than the United States, racism remains depressingly prevalent. You can see it in the response to the coronavirus. Even though the black and Asian community are more likely to die from Covid- the Government has yet to come up with a specic plan to protect them. Yesterday tens of thousands of people were on the streets asking for their voices to be heard. We should listen to them.

It comes as the revelation that a suspect had been identied in her disappearance. Kate and Gerry McCann, from Rothley, Leicestershire, said: “We welcome the appeal today regarding the disappearance of our daughter, Madeleine. “We would like to thank the police forces involved for their continued efforts in the search for Madeleine. “All we have ever wanted is to find her, uncover the truth and bring those responsible to justice.We will never give up hope of finding Madeleine alive but whatever the outcome may be, we need to know, as we need to find peace. “We would encourage anyone who has information directly related to the appeal to contact the police. Thank you.” Ever since her disappearance, Madeleineaposs parents have consistently vowed to keep searching for their daughter. The ceaseless campaign to locate the missing girl has frequently forced the McCanns to recall the day their perfect nuclear family was hit by horror. On May  , the couple left their three children asleep in their holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in southern Portugal while they had dinner with friends at a nearby tapas restaurant. Mr McCann found nothing amiss when he checked on the youngsters just after pm, but when his we ed at about pm she discovered three-year-old Madeleine was missing. Driven by an almost feral reaction they carried out a desperate search and raised the alarm, but from that night their lives would never be the same again. The couple are both from close-knit working-class Catholic families and have found solace through their relatives and their faith in the years since Madeleineaposs disappearance. Mr McCann is from Glasgow and his we from Liverpool, but they met while working as junior doctors at the Western Infirmary in Glasgow. Mrs McCann stopped working as a GP after her daughter went missing to focus on campaign work and her two other children, twins Amelie and Sean, aged just two when Madeleine disappeared. She poured her energies into charity work, including as an ambassador for the Missing People charity, before ing to work in another area of medicine.  Mr McCann is a professor of cardiac imaging at the University of Leicester and a consultant cardiologist who has been open about his mental health struggles since the night Madeleine went missing. Over the years the McCann family have launched numerous public appeals, won high-profile backers, seen millions of pounds in public money spent on investigations, all to no avail. In , the McCanns said they had managed to adjust to a new normality of being a family-of-four, with their focus on giving the twins a very normal, happy and fulfilling le. Speaking to the BBC on the -year anniversary of her daughteraposs disappearance, Mrs McCann said: We had some excellent advice early on. We have been as open with them as we can. We have told them about things and that people are writing things that are simply just untrue and they need to be aware of that. Madeleineaposs parents admitted they have been shocked by hurtful online abuse, saying they had seen the worst and the best of human nature since the campaign to find their daughter thrust them into the spotlight.  They have also endured a long-running libel battle against Goncalo Amaral, the Portuguese detective who led the initial inquiry into Madeleineaposs disappearance, who alleged in a book that the girl had died in the holiday flat. In , Mrs McCann blasted the misinformation, half-truths and downright lies that had circulated around her daughteraposs case, but her husband has insisted that overall they had been overwhelmingly seeing the better side of human nature and received fantastic support. Over the years, the McCanns have built a bond with the Portuguese town where they last saw their daughter. The couple were regular visitors to the church of Our Lady of Light in Praia da Luz after Madeleineaposs disappearance. In , it was revealed that villagers in Praia da Luz have prayed for Madeleine every Sunday since.

And we had flags with us in our dancing gear, we don’t want them to go to waste.” Physical tiredness in April last year triggered a change in her lestyle, unleashing a commitment as formidable as her fight for working people.Follow all corornavirus updates on our live blog hereTaking a pause from organising meals for  hard-up people and  staff in Swansea’s Morriston Hospital, she declares, laughing: “I’ve not cheated once. Not one chip. I’ve not had a chip despite cooking mountains of them. “You see how much you’ve lost, then think is it really worth backtracking for a chocolate or a biscuit. Often I thought I’d have a cup of tea with a Kit-Kat but then thought, no, I’d be forever upset with myself. “It’s so easy to slip back into bad habits so I don’t allow myself a cheat.” The bundle of energy’s love of politics won her respect from MPs in all parties – but she found her weight was weakening her.  She began to wondera meeting was too far away to walk to and she was always looking for a chair. Carolyn said: “I woke up one day and I couldn’t even be bothered to run the Hoover around and I thought this has got ridiculous. It was all down to the fact I allowed myself to put so much weight on. I never lost my enthusiasm and energy for work and I’ll never lose that but I was losing my physical energy, feeling tired and quite depressed.” A chat with Labour’s ex-deputy leader Tom Watson, who shed eight stone, helped. “He said about the keto diet [low carb, high fat]. I thought I’m never going to do this, it’s too stressful. Now I can’t imagine not doing it. “Your tastes change, your body changes and your mind changes. You get a phenomenal amount of energy from the inside out so ­physically you’re not tired and mentally you’re not tired.  “I’d eat anything before. I loved mash and crisps and chocolate, pasties, and a cream tea,” she recalls. “Now I predominantly live off cottage cheese, any kind of cheese, meats, green veg and salad. I eat a lot of fish. I eat a huge amount of walnuts, that’s my sweet thing, a walnut. At least a packet of walnuts a day. “I can’t even drink gin and tonic. I can only drink gin and soda. “Twice in my le I had willpower. I packed in smoking the first time I tried and I’ve got the same determination with the weight. The only clothes I’ve got is what I had to buy since I lost weight.

He said his own experience with the killer bug has made him even more determined to push and shove and shout to help the world recover from the pandemic.

The Prince of Wales, who recovered after suffering from a bout of the disease, declared “each and every one of us has a vital role to play” as he launched the aposGreat Resetapos project, at an online gathering of the World Economic Forum.Lelong environmentalist Charles, , told how countries need to come together to “capture the imagination and will of humanity” in order to rebuild the planet in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.Delivering his keynote speech, he pointed to five main themes we must addresswe are to “shape the type of world we want for ourselves and for future generations. He said: “Everything I have tried to do, and urge, over the past fty years has been done with our children and grandchildren in mind. “So, I can only encourage us all to think big and act now. “These are unprecedented times.Follow all coronavirus updates here on our live blog“In addition to COVID-, over the last few decades we have seen bird flu, swine flu, Ebola, MERS, SARS which are all zoonotic diseases originating in animals. “More than half of all pathogens affecting humans come from animals. “Changing the relationship between wild, domestic and human animals makes pandemics more likely which is why we need to restore balance with the natural world through decisive action on climate change and restoring bioersity.” Charles’s themes centred on firstly capturing the imagination and will of the people in dferent nations to come together for a common purpose. The heir said that despite the global push to get back to normal as we emerge from the pandemic, a “new trajectory of sustainable employment, of livelihoods and economic growth” were needed to inspire future generations. Thirdly, he said countries, industries and businesses should come together to “create efficiencies and economies of scale that will allow us to leapfrog our collective progress and accelerate our transition”.  The Prince added: “This reset moment is our opportunity to accelerate and align our efforts to create truly global momentum. “ Charles, who has long advocated for climate change and the health of the planet to be placed at the heart of economies, speaking via video call from his Scottish home Birkhall said we must fourthly “reinvigorate science, technology and innovation” and finally rebalance investment including investment “in green energy, ecotourism and green public infrastructure”. Royal sources told how the Prince has been working with Professor Klaus Schwab, WEF founder and executive chairman, since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic to determine how Sustainable Markets can serve as a catalyst to ‘build back better’ and to create a more environmentally sustainable future. Professor Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the WEF, told the conference, which included business leaders from BP, Microsoft and Mastercard as well as the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, said: “The Covid- crisis has shown us that our old systems are not fit any more for the st century.

Star Wars actor John Boyega gave an emotional speech - describing demonstrators as a physical representation of our support for George Floyd. The event was organised following the shocking killing of Mr Floyd, who died after white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was filmed pressing down on his neck with his knee. The footage has sparked outrage around the world. Todayaposs protest in London moved from Hyde Park as crowds walked towards Downing Street via Victoria Station. At Victoria, demonstrators hung a sign reading justice for Belly Mujinga, including members of the rail workeraposs family. Belly Mujinga was a rail worker who died from coronavirus after being spat at while on duty at the London station by a man who said he had COVID-. As crowds gathered outside the gates of Downing Street, footage posted to social media showed a disturbance between police and some demontrators. It is not known how the altercation started, but police confirmed two people had been arrested as a result. Many protesters held banners saying I canapost breathe - the words Mr Floyd repeatedly told the officer shortly before he passed out. Others said the UK is not innocent and demanded justice in tackling racism. As they blocked roads around Downing Street and the Houses of parliament, many drivers stuck in traffic sounded their horns in time to chants from the crowd. As part of the protests today, actor Boyega referenced two other black Americans who controversially died in the US and the racist UK murder of Stephen Lawrence, as he told demonstrators: We are a physical representation of our support for George Floyd.We are a physical representation of our support for Sandra Bland. We are a physical representation of our support for Trayvon Martin. We are a physical representation of our support for Stephen Lawrence. Ms Bland died aged  while in police custody in Texas following a traffic stop, while Mr Martin was shot and killed, aged , by a neighbourhood watch volunteer in Florida, with both deaths sparking protests across the US at the time. He added: Iaposm speaking to you from my heart. Look, I donapost knowIaposm going to have a career after this, but f*** that. Today is about innocent people who were halfway through their process. We donapost know what George Floyd could have achieved, we donapost know what Sandra Bland could have achieved, but today weaposre going to make sure that wonapost be an alien thought to our young ones.  I need you to understand how painful this s**t is. I need you to understand how painful it is to be reminded every day that your race means nothing and that isnapost the case any more, that was never the case any more. US President Donald Trump has come under fire for threatening to bring in the military to tackle disorder after curfews were imposed in cities across the country following eight days of protests. Today Boris Johnson was pressed on why he had stayed silent - before he finally voiced his condemnation. The Prime Minister - who said in the Commons on Wednesday that Mr Floydaposs death was inexcusable - has faced calls to review sales of riot control equipment to the US. Protesters were urged by campaigners behind the rally to stick to social distancing rules. Organiser Naomi Smith, , told the Evening Standard: “It’s important that we do this in London to show solidarity. We will keep to the social distance rules and this is a peaceful demonstration.” Todayaposs rally comes after a protest march on Sunday in Central London, with gatherings also held in cities across the UK, including Liverpool and Manchester. Earlier today the Prime Minister was grilled about his response to the crisis, amid calls for him to condemn Trumpaposs heavy handed approach. In answer to a question from Labour leader Keir Starmer, Mr Johnson replied: I think what happened in the United States was appalling, it was inexcusable, we all saw it on our screens and I perfectly understand peopleaposs right to protest what took place. Though obviously I also believe that protest should take place in a lawful and reasonable way.Labour leader Keir Starmer said: I am surprised the Prime Minister hasnapost said anything about this yet. I do hope that next time he speaks to President Trump he will convey to him the UKaposs abhorrence about his response to the events. Chief constables from across the UK have issued an extraordinary joint statement condemning the killing. They said they stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and horried after Mr Floyd, , died after being restrained.  In a statement, the chief constables, the chair of the National Police Chiefsapos Council, the chief executive of the College of Policing and the president of the Police Superintendentsapos Association said: We stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and horried by the way George Floyd lost his le.Justice and accountability should follow. They have also urged people who want to make their voices heard to be aware thatcoronavirus remains a deadly disease and there are still restrictions in place to prevent its spread, which include not gathering outside in groups of more than six people.

Under the plans, bar stools would be replaced with trestle tables and benches and pint glasses scrapped in favour of two-pint steins.The possible move from cosy boozer to German drinking hall comes amid warning % of British pubs face closure due to coronavirus.The British Beer and Pub Association said it was confident “German-style” settings would work for some UK pubs. They would comply with social-distancing rules by keeping customers away from the traditional bar area. Emma McClarkin, BBPA Chief Executive, said they are open to suggestions on how businesses can reopen. “We are closely monitoring what other countries are doing opening their bars andthere is anything we can introduce,” she said. “The German-style may work for some of our pubs. “The main thing we are focusing on is social distancing. The two-metre distancing is the biggest challenge pubs will face.  “All the countries on the continent are going to be waiter-service only to maintain social distancing. “Table service by staff is going to be the way forward for some time. “I think there is going to be a new normal and we have to find what that normal is going to be.” Pubs with beer gardens are hoping to be given the green light by the government to reopen in a matter of weeks. But drinkers have been warned to expect them to resemble “zoos” with one-way systems and less standing areas.  CAMRAaposs National Chairman Nik Antona said there is a danger British pubs could be “changed forever” by social distancing. “It’s imperative that pubs can open as soon as it is safe to do so, and all ideas to bring this about are welcome. “Having an open space where you can mingle at the bar and order drinks is an essential part of the pub-going experience.  “It gives visitors a chance to make friends and socialise in a common area that they don’t find in cafes or restaurants. “I’d be very concernedthis intrinsic pub characteristic is removed and rationing introduced in the name of safety.

And as police appear to be on the brink of finally solving the riddle of her disappearance, people around the world touched by their plight are praying for them. Madeleine was three when she vanished from her bed in a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May , . Kate and Gerry, both doctors from Leicestershire, had been enjoying a meal with seven friends at a Tapas restaurant about ft away. The ground-floor flat where Madeleine and her two-year-old twin siblings Sean and Amelie were asleep could just be seen over the top of a colourful bougainvillea bush. The parents took it in turns to check on the youngsters, every  minutes.At pm, Kate discovered Madeleine was missing. A frantic search of the quiet resortwas launched and witnesses told of Kate’s anguished screams and seeing Gerry sobbing on a friend’s shoulder.Fellow tourists asked in bars and scoured the surrounding roads and scrubland. One of the McCanns’ friends, Jane Tanner, later told police she saw a man carrying a young girl down the road when she checked on her own children at .pm. A police sketch based on her account was circulated but it was later claimed the man pictured carrying the girl was an innocent British dad taking his daughter home from the creche. He even agreed to be pictured in the clothes he wore to prove he was the man in the sketch.  Madeleine soon became the most reported missing person case in history and early images beamed around the globe focused on the distinctive mark in the iris of her right eye. Twelve days after the disappearance, British-Portuguese property consultant Robert Murat became the police’s first “arguido” a person of interest who is treated as more than a witness but is not charged. Innocent Murat, , who lived about  yards from the apartment, resembled the Ms Tanner’s photofit. But he ceased to be an arguido and was treated as a witness instead. The devastated McCanns themselves were the next target of the Portuguese police and were shocked to be named as arguidos. Two days later, they flew back to Britain, saying they had to go home for the sake of their twins. Lead investigator Gonçalo Amaral was removed from the case in disgrace after criticising British police and the McCanns in an interview about his book, The Truth of the Lie. He made shocking allegations that Mad­eleine died in the holiday apartment and the McCanns had covered up her death. And he shamelessly plugged his books in shopping centres, signing them like a celebrity.  Kate said during their libel battles with him: “It was very painful to read and I also felt anxious and fearful because of the damage I felt it was doing here in Portugal. “We were working so hard, trying to do everything in our power. It was hard enough without all our efforts being crushed in this way. It intensied the pain and fear that there was no point and we might as well give up.” Two snfer dogs trained to detect the “scent of death” from corpses and blood made alert signals in the apartment. They were also said to have found a scent in a car Kate and Gerry rented three weeks after Maddie vanished. But samples analysed by the UK’s Forensic Science Service were “inconclusive”. Kate and Gerry said later they feared Maddie’s kidnapper may strike again and they believed he or she would have been laughing at claims they hid her body.  In November , a local pizza shop owner told British media he saw a “vicious-looking” man and woman dragging a little blonde girl towards the marina at am. He said Portuguese police ignored his report. Another Ocean Club worker later claimed to have seen a man lurking under the stairwell outside the McCanns’ apartment. Then in July , the Portuguese police shelved the probe and released the McCanns as arguidos. But Kate and Gerry refused to give up and set up a fund to raise cash to keep hunting.Hopes continued to be raised, only to be dashed. In , the McCanns met Theresa May, then Home Secretary, and PM David Cameron to beg them to get the British police involved. Officers flew to Portugal to look and began following the first of  lines of inquiry. In , detectives said Madeleine could still be alive and released a computer image of how she may look aged nine. And in , searches of , square metres of scrubland were made. British police have spent almost £million on the hunt and taken , statements, collected , exhibits and probed  persons of interest, plus  sex offenders. In March this year, the Met requested a cash boost to follow their final lines of inquiry, which the Home Office was expected to approve.

One person wrote: Looks easier and faster than using a kne.  Another joked that people should use minty floss, saying: Minty floss would be delicious as well.

They explained: This is really great for making cinnamon rolls when you are tired of them getting all squished as you cut them.Slide the floss under the end of the cylinder of dough. Lt just the edge of the dough to get the floss under there, then it is thin enough to slide back until you have the desired thickness for a cinnamon roll. Bring the two ends of the floss up and around the dough. They should end up making an X above the dough. Now pull the ends of the floss so that the X gets wider on top and the floss will cut down through the dough without squishing. When it gets to the bottom and exits the dough, it will also uncross itself and you are ready for the next slice. My aunts, Carol and Judy, been making perfect cinnamon rolls for church and family reunions for about  years with this method. I keep a thingy of floss in a kitchen drawer with my other prep tools so I donapost have to remember to get it from the bathroom.

even though it has not yet applied for planning permission.Last month, Aldi announced its intention to build its third store in the city on Countesswells Road, opposite the entrance to the Robert Gordon#s College playing fields.Representatives from the German chain attended a virtual meeting of the Craigiebuckler and Seafield Community Council earlier this week, and fielded questions from residents on a number of issues surrounding the proposed development.The company#s property director Philip Johnston revealed a contract has already been signed with property developer Dandara, which is responsible for the adjacent housing development. vw, px\"  Dandara would play no part in the building of the shop.Mr Johnston explained Aldi is keen to bring another store to Aberdeen as it wants to expand its presence in the city.Currently it has two stores # one at the Beach Retail Park and the other at Cornhill.He said: “In Dundee we have four properties and permission for another, but we are under-represented in Aberdeen and it’s an area we have been targeting quite heavily.“There are limited options for people to shop in the area. Generally they have to go to Bridge of Dee, and we want to bring something a bit more locally.“We started looking in the area around , and we have now concluded a contract with Dandara and we are now in a position where we want to pursue planning permission for it.“On average, people visit our stores three to four times a week and generally they are coming from the local community.“This store would be primarily aimed at people in the growing communities to give them more local options.”The store would be around four metres at its highest point and would consist of roughly the same layout as Aldi#s other shops, with the company employing a unorm approach.It would have around  parking spaces, but representatives at the meeting insisted it was highly unlikely all of these would be in use at once.The store would be designed to be in keeping with nearby developments, while measures would be introduced to combat noise concerns.Although a number of trees would need to be removed to make way for the store, Mr Johnston said Aldi plans to plant three more for each one it takes out.And the company would look to create a footpath along the north side of Countesswells Road, and would seek to have it adopted by Aberdeen City Council.A planning application for the proposed development is expected to be submitted in due course.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config  #

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

These allow vets to make the best diagnosis possible and give advice or treatment whichever is required.Medications and prescriptions can be collected from the Tranent surgery or posted or delivered via courier to clients.Reception staff are extremely busy as they have to determine which category the phone call falls into. There is no such thing as making a basic appointment now. Everything takes much longer to discuss and consequently sometimes the telephone system is overwhelmed.You can, of course, leave a message or send an email, contact websites or Facebook pages. Someone will respond to your question as soon as possible. The reception team are doing a wonderful job, as of course they are at all veterinary practices. They are our frontline heroes who deserve special applause.At Dunedin Vets, we are now seeing more emergency cases after triage.Dogs and cats who are now almost three months overdue their boosters can now have them. This will prevent them having to restart their vaccine course and means their owners only having to visit the practice once.All pups and kittens who had first vaccines before lockdown should have had their second vaccines now. Pups can start vaccine courses as long as they have been in their new home for at least one week, are over ten weeks old and their owners are not self- isolating.We are trying to delay kittensrsquo vaccinations as long as possible ndash especiallythey are not going out.We will try to do one vaccine at neutering time, to reduce the number of visits. If your rabbit is due boosters just now, as many rabbits are, prior to going outdoors, both vaccines can be given at the same time rather than two weeks apart ndash again reducing the number of outings to the surgery. Clients are not allowed in the surgery, having smaller animals in cages and dogs on leads helps in the handover of pets.I am sure all veterinary practices have been thinking about when we can have clients back in the surgery.At Dunedin Vets, we will have safety shields on reception desks and distancing stickers as well as hazard tape on the floor. Staff will be wearing masks and visors and there will be a limit to the numbers of clients allowed in the surgery at any one time.Hopefully we can open our other branches and have all our staff back at work soon. Until then we continue doing as we are doing and keeping everyone safe.During this period of lockdown there have been some ongoing cases which have required regular treatment, examinations and blood tests. These include diabetics, dogs with Addisonrsquos or Cushingrsquos conditions and cats with blood pressure and thyroid problems as well as those with heart conditions.One patient who had to be seen throughout this time is Buri.Buri is a four-year-old German Shepherd dog belonging to Mrs Sarah McHale and family who visit our Dunbar surgery.In November , Buri was seen at Dunbar with an apparent urinary tract infection. He had been drinking more and going to the toilet lots. When examined, he was a fit, lively dog, but had several large lymph nodes under his neck.Rhiannon the vet took a sample from the glands which I examined under the microscope. I found some large, unusual cells. Buri came for a biopsy under anaesthetic.The samples were sent to a laboratory for testing and unfortunately the results were not good. Buri had lymphoma, a cancer of blood cells which results in enlargement of lymph nodes. This is a form of cancer which we can treat in practice with chemotherapy.The particular type of lymphoma Buri had would respond better to a drug he needed to have at Edinburgh Vet School. So for the next five months, every week Buri attended either our Tranent branch for one type of chemotherapy and sometimes to the Vet School at Penicuik for the other.He had to take tablets every day as well. He had numerous blood tests to check his blood count and to check all his organs were ing well. He also had urine samples checked to make sure no problem was developing.He was such a good lad. He had to be away from his family when the chemotherapy was being administered.Vet Jonny and nurse Fiona, dressed in their chemotherapy PPE, became his best friends. He seemed to love coming to the surgery bouncing about and wanting to play with everyone.He responded very well to his treatment. His lymph nodes reduced rapidly. He remained happy and healthy, eating well and had very few side effects from the chemotherapy. The weeks wore on and Buri became a regular at the surgery, usually on a Tuesday afternoon, when all the staff looked out for him.When lockdown came, we received a message from the Vet School that they were unable to carry out further chemotherapy treatments.Buri was at the end of his treatment there.We continued to give him his chemotherapy for three more weeks, when on April , he received his very last dose.He was still the happy boy we adored. We decided to ring that final chemo bell and give him a round of applause which he justly deserved.His mum had to stay at home self- isolating but we shared a video and photos with her, which she loved.She was happy for us to spread the good news and our Facebook video post went viral.No doubt Buri will have ups and downs and may require further treatment but we wish Buri and his family every good wish for the future.Stay safe everyone."},{"url":null,"title":"column-qmus-important-research-role","story":"NICOLA Sturgeon has now released the Scottish Governmentrsquos lsquoroute maprsquo for leading us through the Covid- crisis, which is available for everyone to read on the Scottish Governmentrsquos website.As of today , we will begin to work through the phases of our gradual emergence out of lockdown.Whilst we all want to get back to normality, it is important that we strike a balance between protecting the publicrsquos health but also in allowing people to have inidual freedoms.In phase one, you will be able to meet with one other household at a two-metre distance, as long as it is outside, and many outdoor sports such as golf and tennis will be permitted.The overall message remains: stay as home as much as we can, to avoid a second wave.I would like to congratulate Queen Margaret University on being awarded pound, from the Scottish Government to support it in rapid coronavirus research.This will be sure to play a signicant role across Scotland in understanding the effect that the virus will have.Research such as this is fundamentally important in developing policies and treatment for Covid- and this will undoubtedly contribute to saving lives.To commend this good news, I have submitted a congratulatory motion to my colleagues in the Scottish Parliament and I hope this will be well supported by them.I would like to thank QMU for undertaking this work, and wish the researchers working in this area all the best.I would like to thank community councils for all their work in supporting the local area through this challenging time.I know that many have been making efforts to ensure people have access to food, prescriptions and also emotional support.Our community councils often make huge dferences in our community but receive little recognition for their hard work."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-communities-aberlady-gifford-haddington-athelstaneford-longniddry-macmerry-gladsmuir-ormiston","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at six of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Aberlady.

But it will remain for some time I suspect.My thoughts on the beach the other day drted to my older kids, who I have been unable to see because they are on the other side of that invisible fence.Then I remembered a scene in a novel I read when I was at high school.The novel was Lord of the Flies by William Golding.It left a deep impression on me at the time.The story is about a group of boys who are stranded on an uninhabited island after an airplane crash.They are without any adults, and so they must organise and govern themselves in order to survive.At first they do this by having rules and symbols of authority that everyone respects.One of the boys finds a conchand itrsquos used to give democratic order to discussions.A boy called Ralph tries to maintain this semblance of order and fairness, but it all starts to break down.Gradually, the modes of behaviour they learnt in society before the crash erode, as some of the boys realise they can now do what they want.The scene from the novel which I remembered describes how one of the older boys, called Roger, throws stones close to a younger boy named Henry, who is playing on the beach.He wants to hit him, but he doesnrsquot.Golding explains why: ldquoRoger gathered a handful of stones and began to throw them.ldquoYet there was a space round Henry, perhaps six yards in diameter, into which he dare not throw.ldquoHere, invisible yet strong, was the taboo of the old le. Round the squatting child was the protection of parents and school and policemen and the law.Later of course, Roger finally rejects these taboos of the old le, and actually kills another boy with a rock.By this time, the new society created by the boys on the island has become cruel and despotic.The conch has been smashed and a boy called Jack has become a power crazed leader, ruling with terror.At its core, the novelrsquos message is a very pessimistic one that when the constraints imposed by commonly agreed standards of behaviour and humanitarian respect are removed, people will descend into uncaring and savage norms of behaviour, led by power crazed rulers.The novel was criticised for this pessimism, but of course there are many examples in history, and in current times, of despotic cruel regimes and societies.But my thoughts on this, as I played with my younger kids on the beach, were that there are more good folk in this world whose collective will has made those boundaries and keep them in place.I see it all around me people in communities creating norms of kindness, consideration and care.Yes, therersquos rudeness, selfishness and aggression too, but every smile, every kind act, every respectful exchange dilutes them and helps shore up the norms of a caring society.That protective invisible fence we currently have around ourselves is a product of our care for others as well as for ourselves.What gives it strength is not so much enforcement, but the understanding that for the benefit of others we sometimes canrsquot, or shouldnrsquot, just do what we want.Integrity and honesty are the cornerstones of this.We can disagree on objectives and priorities, but without these values our conch is broken.I have had some discussions with my youngest daughter recently about the importance of owning your actions and taking responsibility. Shersquos six and she gets it.These were my thoughts as I walked the Pans shore with my youngest kids.But I was thankfully taken out of them by my wee boy, who is currently obsessed with King Kong.He asked me: ldquoIs that island over there where King Kong lives "},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-communities-cockenzie-port-seton-humbie-east-west-saltoun-bolton-musselburgh-prestonpans-tranent-elphinstone","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at five of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Cockenzie and Port Seton.

This can lead to problems starting your car when it comes time to get back to work. Better keep those jump leads handy.Rustybrake discsA rusty brake disc can be a real problem.When your car is being usedregularly, your brake discs can take care of themselves - but when left standing for too long, they can rust.This happens when rain falls on your brake discs and is left to dry out.Normally any surface rust comes off through using your brakes the next time you drive, but when the cars off the road this doesnt happen and repeated soaking and drying can cause the rust to build up and badly damage the brake discs.Fortunately most of the country has enjoyed mostly dry weather during this lockdown so - butyou think your brakes arent working as they should, you need to get them checked out urgently.Flat tyresIm sure it wasnt like this when I parked it.If youve got a slow puncture, it can take quite a while before your tyre deflates enough to be noticeable. If you had one before you stopped driving, by now it could well be completely flat.

said: ldquoIn moving from a four-term to a three-term entry we will continue to support early entry for children with particular needs or those considered as vulnerable, as is the case now, to ensure

series of images also unveiled.The proposed ClimatEvolution Zone would cover the under-construction town of Blindwells and surroundingcommunities stretching from Prestonpans to Longniddry and inland to Tranent and Macmerry.East Lothian Council is petitioning the Scottish Government to extend the National Development status given to the former Cockenzie Power Station site in its National Planning Frameworkdocument to a wider area in its planned revised framework which is under review.This could pave the way for the creation of the ClimatEvolution Zone which could transform the area over the next  years through innovative approaches to development.A public consultation on the vision has been launched by the council and breaks the plans down into dferent themes from environment to travel.It asks people to give their views on its approach to a wide range of issues including access and movement the water environment culture, heritage and leisure greenspace and bioersity strong communities and regeneration and enterprise.However, the vision has already come under fire from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council which branded it ldquocomplex and unclear.The community council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of public consultations in  but the report remains an informal ldquovisionary document.Now the former power station site could be merged into the new ClimatEvolution Zone with no reference to the original masterplan.Bryan Hickman, community council chairman, said: ldquoThe community council are very concerned by the documents recently published by the council.\"We understood that the changes required for NPF related to the former power station site.\"The y report now extends to Tranent, Prestonpans, Cockenzie and Port Seton, Longniddry and Blindwells as well as the power station site.\"Whilst some of the objectives are to be welcomed, the overall content is complex and unclear and includes such a large area as to be unmanageable in its detail.ldquoThe existing communities have been consulted on the power station site and the result was a masterplan commissioned by the council but not adopted by them.\"We have submitted this masterplan to be included in NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the Scottish Government, The Lothian Drainage Partnership, SEPA, Scottish Water and Scottish Natural Heritage.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells and harness the latest technologies to reduce the arearsquos carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater at Blindwells to create waterways and using natural geothermic energy to heat the outdoor water features.Douglas Proudfoot, project leader, said the idea behind the new water features was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as the new town of Blindwells develops on the former opencast coal site of the same name between Longniddry and Tranent.The first houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.\"I also think the Covid- pandemic has driven forward the idea that people can work from home and find alternative ways to work with the support of digital technology.Central to the vision is alternative ways to travel with an emphasis on walkways and cycle routes.A new train station at a central hub within an area the council has dubbed Greater Blindwells will provide additional access to public transport.To the north of the central hub between Cockenzie and Port Seton and Longniddry there are proposals for a water park or outdoor leisure area with the potential to create a lido with space for kayaking and other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar developmentin modular manufacture and construction.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray welcomed the ambitious strategy.He said: ldquoThe Cockenzie and Blindwells sites are adjacent to one another and it has always been inevitable that their development will be closely linked, so it makes sense to seek to extend National Development status to Blindwells.ldquoThe whole area offers unique potential to transform these former industrial sites into places where people can live and work in a sustainable way.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, also welcomed the project which will lsquointeractrsquo with neighbouring communities.He said: ldquoThe area is a far wider community and cannot be seen in isolation.The inclusion of adjacent communities is therefore essential.Councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the proposals are not a lsquofinalised masterplanrsquo but rather a ldquohigh level document which sets out an ambitious vision for the area over the coming  years.He said: ldquoItrsquos an exciting opportunity to ensure that one of the key areas of East Lothian, is developed in an innovative way.\"Itrsquos not all about whatrsquos new, though.\"We are looking at enhancing the existing local environment and making the most of the arearsquos unique history as well as its mining

Now Irsquom out every day, and Irsquove been to places I never knew existed despite living here for  years.Since lockdown rules turned family le on its head, Scott, , we Dawn,  and boys Matt, , and nine-year-old Euan have discovered a new love for cycling.ldquoWhen things stopped and I started working from home, we got the bikes out and found ourselves going further and further, he says.ldquoNow the boys are used to being on the roads, their road awareness is improving, and we all love it.Cycling has emerged as one of the few winners from the current pandemic, with bike shops reporting soaring sales and waiting lists of up to three months for new bikes.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson recently confirmed cycling levels are % higher compared with the lockdown baseline, while Cycling Scotlandrsquos automatic cycling counters at  spots around the country revealed remarkable results, with one in Dunfermline recording an increase of % since lockdown.ldquoI donrsquot think anyone could have foreseen the level of increase in demand for bikes, says Chris Tiso, whose Tiso Group runs Alpine Bikes, Scotlandrsquos largest independent bike retailer.ldquoBetween our two bike stores in Edinburgh and Aberdeen and online, wersquore selling between  to  bikes a week which is signicantly more than we would expect.ldquoAll bike retailers have been swamped by the most phenomenal demand.

The top priority to ensure more people cycle is dedicated, segregated cycling paths, separate from traffic.ldquoIncreasing access to bikes, places to store them and cycle training wherever required are the other measures to ensure even more people can enjoy cycling for essential journeys or exercise.Even with new cycle lanes, we have a lot of pedalling to do to catch up with some of our European cousins: in the Netherlands, % of journeys are by bike, while in Denmark the figure is %. Prior to lockdown, Britain managed just % of journeys by bike.And there are lingering concerns that the rise in cycling may be offset by people who would normally use public transport choosing to travel by car instead.ldquoTherersquos no doubt therersquos an increase in cyclists, but Irsquom not convinced itrsquos driven by anything more than leisure and keeping fit, he says. ldquoThere seems to be a big rush to change things when we donrsquot know what the new normal is.ldquoWhen people do go back to work, they will still be living in suburbs, theyrsquoll still work in dferent parts of the city, and still want to get around. Evenwe multiply cycling -fold, itrsquos not close to the amount of trips done by car.ldquoItrsquos taking a bit of a punt to hope that people will stick with bicycles.To do that, Tim Burns of Sustrans suggests there will have to be more than pop-up cycle routes.ldquoEven the most ambitious plans for walking and cycling from cities across the UK are unlikely to meet the needs of all people who formerly took public transport, he says.He suggests making mph the default speed in all urban and residential areas, removing VAT from cycle sales, more cycle parking, free cycle servicing, and the development of ldquopark and cycle facilities at park and ride hubs.ldquoStaggering sht patterns during the day and rotating shts during which people can come into the office will also be important, he adds.At home in Edinburgh, Scott Gammie ndash who, ironically, works in the car trade as a franchise principle at Lexus in Edinburgh and Glasgow ndash is certain the family will be more than just lockdown cyclists.ldquoWersquoll keep doing this, he says. ldquoMy we is now planning to cycle to work in the city centre.

Part of the ldquoFrank, Get the Door series arts editor Will Gompertz reviewing a rap album, this weekrsquos video was up there with Godleyrsquos post-Calderwood skit In reality, the First Minister began the week with a perfectly polite warning that she would not hesitate to put the new rules into lawpeople continued to meet in large groups, travel long distances to beauty spots, and so on.The reaction did not take long to arrive. ldquoWhy on earth canrsquot the SNP treat us like adults  was one cry, and that was on The Heraldrsquos letters page, a citadel of civilised debate .As one letter writer put it, ldquoThe SNP-led Scottish Government has lectured us for more than a decade about our eating, smoking and drinking habits, all to no avail for the most part. A bloated body of NGOs, third sector organisations and charities in Scotland is testament to this.Point taken. Wharsquos like Scots when it comes to doing as we please  But is the answer to the problem a dferent, lighter touch, or should the Scottish Government be as tough on obesity and booze as it is on gatherings of more than eight people I thoroughly enjoyed my weekend ndash or ldquofreedom day as I heard someone describe it ndash and I hope you did too, evenit was just having a socially distant tea and a bun with a pal. I have to admit, though, that things did get fairly silly out there. The gulf between how people should behave and how they actually do can be wide and depressing to behold. In this case, one small step away from lockdown translated into one giant leap into misbehaviour by some.After just one day of good weather there was litter all over and, near me at least, rows of cars badly parked on pavements causing a hazard to the many cyclists weaving in and out . In the words of Jonathan Van Tam, Englandrsquos deputy chief medical officer, certain people ldquotore the pants out of lockdown easing.It could just have been the weather and people being relieved to be out and about again. Then again, there is a part of the Scots character, particularly in the west of Scotland, that delights in thumbing its nose, or some such gesture, at authority.It is there in our history, our culture, a general attitude to le. If it persists as strongly as it has in the past, then Ms Sturgeon and her Government are going to have a problem on their hands enforcing the new rules.As it is, governments of every stripe have struggled to persuade Scots to do what is good for them. Selections from the latest Scottish Health survey illustrate the point: levels of harmful hazardous drinking have hardly changed since ditto levels of exercise only % of children have the recommended five fruit and veg a day two thirds of adults are overweight, including % who were obese.One piece of positive news was on smoking, down from % in  to a still too high %. When it comes to poor health we have become a bad joke, though there is nothing funny about the pain and misery inflicted on sufferers and those they leave behind.Again,the virus-linked backlog of people requiring treatment is as large as figures suggest, more Scots will be living with the effects of ill health for longer. It has always been important to improve the nationrsquos health and well-being. Now it is a matter of le and death, a decent quality of le versus a miserable existence waiting for treatment.The past few months of lockdown has been a test of personal and national character. For all that there was some bending of the limits last week, people have by and large been extraordinarily compliant, more so than governments ever thought they would be.They have kept to the rules despite the bad example set by some of those who set the edicts in the first place.Let us be honest: some of the grumbling about people breaking the rules is rooted in snobbery. Look at those folk queuing in their cars for fast food, packing into public transport to go to the beach. Tut, tut.But never forget that the most obvious rule breakers have been those in privileged, prominent positions. It was a chief medical officer who twice travelled to her second home at the height of lockdown. It was a chief adviser to the Prime Minister who went on a -mile round trip to a beauty spot to test his eyesight. All good middle class folk with degrees.The public by and large knows the score on the pandemic and is trying to act accordingly. This is not praise for Boris Johnsonrsquos appeal to ldquogood British common sense approach. The sensible public know the Prime Minister is a fool who once boasted of shaking hands with coronavirus patients.They know politicians dropped the ball on testing.They are only too aware that the NHS was protected at the expense of care homes.They know that the latest rules on quarantine for travellers, announced yesterday, are too late and will soon be quietly shelved.Above all, the public knows that governments in Edinburgh and London have been making up their responses as they go along.As we are forever being told, this is an unprecedented situation, mistakes will be made.

Funny though, the words Donald Trump never crossed his lips.As expected, Sir Keir picked up on a report that suggested our straw-haired premier was taking ldquodirect control of Governmentrsquos response to the virus and so asked, to Labour laughter, who had been in direct control thus far.The PM snfed and hit back, to noises of encouragement from the Tory benches, listing his Governmentrsquos achievements, like getting the death rate down, and once again insisted the publicrsquos ldquogood British common sense would see the country through.Then came Borisrsquos first level of irritation, telling the Labour leader: ldquoWhat the country would like to hear from him is more signs of co-operation in that endeavour.The chief comrade, leaning on the dispatch box, pointed out how he had written confidentially to the PM two weeks ago to offer support in getting children back to school south of the Border buthellipdidnrsquot get a reply.When Sir K claimed a poll had shown the public had lost trust in the Governmentrsquos handling of the pandemic Boris reached the second level of irritation.He expressed surprise at the Labour knightrsquos tone given he had ldquotaken the trouble to ring him up and had gone through the Governmentrsquos plan, which the Leader of the Opposition had ldquothoroughly endorsed.The atmosphere got icier as the chief comrade rounded on the Governmentrsquos ldquoworld-beating test and trace scheme, which, he said, was not fully up and running as promised but the PM muttered from his seat: ldquoItrsquos not true.Then, banging the dispatch box, Boris reached the third level of irritation, accusing his opposite number of casting aspersions on people who had volunteered to set up the new scheme from a standing start as a result of which ldquothousands of people had been tested and were self-isolating.As Tory hear hears rang out, the Labour chief calmly pointed out there were no precise figures and that even when the Government used statistics there were concerns from the official Statistics Authority they were not being used properly. Again, he raised the issue of public trust.By now, Borisrsquos blood began to boil as he reached level four, complaining: ldquoI really do not see the purpose of these endless attacks on public trust and confidence.Sir Keir snapped: ldquoThe PM confuses scrutiny for attacks. Insisting he had been supporting the Government, he told Bozza: ldquoBut boy, he makes it dficult to support this Government over the last two weeks.The Labour chief challenged on the Governmentrsquos alert level, suggesting being at level four did not allow the lting of the current restrictions.As the Old Etonian reached the fth level of irritation, he again banged the dispatch box, insisting the Labour knight knew ldquoperfectly well the alert level DID allow the easing, pointing out how, during their cosy tete-a-tete on the telephone, he did not raise the issue once.The static in his hair fizzing, Boris accused Sir K of a U-turn of backing the Government strategy and now opposing it. ldquoOur policy is test, trace and isolate, his policy is agree, U-turn and criticise, he declared.While the PM gave a robust response to his opponentrsquos attacks, Sir K knows, after years of Corbynrsquos missed punches, Boris is beginning to take a few hits on the chin and doesnrsquot like it."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-snp-minister-suggests-staring-shoppers-without-face-masks","story":"Constitution Secretary Michael Russell said there was currently a problem with too few people wearing face coverings in supermarkets and on public transport.The Government has recommended people wear one in such circumstances to guard against unwittingly spreading coronavirus, but it is voluntary, not compulsory.At Holyroodrsquos Covid- committee, Annabelle Ewing, the SNP MSP for Cowdenbeath, said the tone of the public health messaging was not yet right.She said: ldquoI was at a supermarket last night.

The law of political thermodynamics states that eventually entropy sets into every leader during a crisis, and so it is with Ms Sturgeon. Her recent talk about reimposing the lockdown, for instance, sounded bad-tempered and maternalistic and, worse, out of tune with whatrsquos happening on the ground: people are starting to use their own judgments about risk.The First Minister has also done something wersquove seen the SNP do before in a crisis. If you watch Ru Paulrsquos Drag Race, yoursquoll recognise it as the ldquolook over there! tactic. Effectively what happens is that, when faced with some tricky statistics, the cornered SNP minister will say something like, ldquoyes, itrsquos bad, but at least itrsquos not as bad as England! Theyrsquove done it before with schools and the NHS. And now theyrsquore doing it with coronavirus.:Opinion: Mark Smith: Unionists need to get over themselves. Dference with England is a good thingBut we know that comparisons with other places are inherently problematic. Dferent countries have dferent circumstances, they record and collect data in dferent ways, and politics gets in the way too. Do we really believe the figures coming out of Bolsonarorsquos Brazil for example  There seems to be massive under-reporting of the deaths there, particularly in the favelas, and there are the same suspicions about the death rate in Russia.Comparisons between Scotland and England raise similar problems, although that doesnrsquot stop the First Minister doing it. When asked about Scotlandrsquos excess death rateMs Sturgeon resorted to the England get-out clause right away. ldquoThey are still much higher than we want them to be, she said, ldquobut they are lower than the excess deaths in England. Look over there!However, the thing about comparisons with other countries is that the First Minister isnrsquot the only one who can do them. Ms Sturgeon is right to say the recorded excess death rate in Scotland is lowerthan Englandrsquos, but itrsquos higher than the rate in Wales and Northern Ireland and massively higher than Germany, Norway, the US, and many other countries. It depends which comparison you do.Itrsquos also been pointed out to Ms Sturgeon that comparisons with England do not always work in her favour and that Scotland has a higher death rate in care homes than England does. But her response to that is that deaths in English care homes are being under-reported, which is rather the point isnrsquot it  Dferent countries record these things in dferent ways which makes comparisons problematic. So stop doing it.The implication behind the comparisons with England, of course, is that Ms Sturgeon and her government are responsible for the fact that Scotland appears to be doing better. But that isnrsquot necessarily so, again because of the problem of comparing countries: Scotland has a much lower population density than England and Englandrsquos figures include London, where the virus spread first and fast before the national lockdown. The Scottish Government has also followed broadly the same policies and timings as the UK, which suggests any dferences are down to ying populations, or reporting techniques, or something .The point is that, rather than making such comparisons, the focus should be on improvement instead. When challenged about waiting times for cancer treatment or in AE, or the pass rates in schools, or the excess death rate from coronavirus, the Scottish Government shouldnrsquot be comparing the figures to England, they should be comparing the figures to the record in Scotland itself. In other words, are we doing better or worse in Scotland than we were before  Reasonable people will care about things getting better in Scotland, not being better than England.:Opinion: Iain Macwhirter: Mistakes, mistakes, but Nicola Sturgeon has cornered the market on public trustThe problem is that changing the narrative in this way is unlikely to happen as long as the English get-out clause appears to work with some voters. Nicola Sturgeonrsquos approval rating on the handling of the pandemic is above % even though the policies and consequences of Covid have been broadly similar in England and Scotland.Partly, the relative immunity from political damage may be because of those small but dodgy comparisons with England hitting the mark. But partly it may be because of the most damning comparison of all: the calm, competent and occasionally emotional performance in Edinburgh and the bumbling of the Tory androids in London.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

We can all enjoy a conspiracy theory but you need to have evidence.However Sir Richard said a scientic paper published this week by a Norwegian-British research team suggested key elements in the genetic sequence of the virus were ldquoinserted and may not have evolved naturally.The Dailyreported that in the study, produced by Professor Angus Dalgleish of St Georgersquos Hospital at the University of London and Norwegian virologist Birger Sorensen, the scientists claim to have found ldquoinserted sections placed on the SARS-CoV- Spike surface which could explain how the virus binds with human cells.In the podcast, Sir Richard suggested scientists may have been experimenting on bat coronaviruses when Covid- escaped.He also raised the prospect of China potentially paying for the global damage caused by the pandemic.ldquoI do think that this started as an accident, Sir Richard said.ldquo a very important contribution to a debate which is now starting about how the virus evolved and how it got out and broke out as a pandemic.ldquoIt raises the issue,China ever were to admit responsibility, does it pay reparations The Dailyreported the peer-reviewed paper has been re-written several times as some scientists dismissed its original conclusions.An earlier version of the study, seen by the paper, claimed to prove ldquobeyond reasonable doubt that the Covid- virus is engineered.Further analysis of the research, due to be released in the coming days, reportedly claims the Covid- virus has ldquounique fingerprints that indicate ldquopurposive manipulation by humans.ldquoAs this debate about the virus develops, I think all this material is going to be in print and is going to embarrass a number of people, Sir Richard said.The paper also reportedly warned that current vaccine efforts are doomed because the cause of the virus has been misunderstood.The researchers are attempting to solve this issue by developing their own vaccine, according to the paper."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-carlaw-says-cummingss-lockdown-excuses-not-wholly-convincing","story":"The Scottish Tory leader said Mr Cummingsrsquos account was not ldquowholly convincing and had left voters feeling ldquoperplexed and angry.Despite a backbench revolt and voter outrage, the Prime Minister refused to sack his chief adviser last week after it emerged he broke the lockdown in March.Mr Cummings drove  miles with his sick we and their four-year-old from London to his familyrsquos farm in Durham in order to get childcare. He later developed Covid.Mr Cummings said this was an exceptional reasonallowed bythe guidance, despite those with Covid symptoms being instructedto self-isolate at home.In a press conference in the Downing Street garden last Monday, Mr Cummings confirmed he and his family had also made a -mile round trip from Durham to Barnard Castle.He claimed the visit, to a beauty spot on April , his wersquos birthday, had been necessary to test whether his eyesight was good enough for thedrive to London.He said he had never considered resigning, and Mr Johnson urged the public to ldquomove on.However the eye-test excuse prompted yet more anger, and the following day Moray MP Douglas Ross quit as a Scotland Office minister, saying he could not justy Mr Cummingsrsquos behaviour to his constituents.The same day, Mr Carlaw said Mr Cummings should consider his position as he had become a ldquodistraction in the fight against Covid-.Polls have shown a sharp fall in the publicrsquos trust in Mr Johnsonrsquos government and a strong desire for Mr Cummings to leave his post for failing to follow the rules millions of others did.In his first major interview since the row, Mr Carlaw told BBC Radio Scotland that, besides being a distraction, Mr Cummingsalso lacked credibility.He said: ldquoI believe that he should have gone.ldquoI do believe that after we heard his explanation on the Monday, when he was able to give his version of events, it didnrsquot draw a line under things.ldquoI think it left people perplexed and angry, and the following day I gave interviews to ious organisations where I made it clear I thought he should be considering his position, and he should have gone at that point.ldquoThe focus, as the First Minister has said, has to be entirely on the ongoing tackling of Covid, and I believe hersquos proved a distraction to that task.Askedhe believed Mr Cumminsgs should have gone merely because he was a distraction, rather than for what he said in his justication, Mr Carlaw replied: ldquoNo, I donrsquot think that.ldquoI didnrsquot find the explanation at all wholly convincing. That too.ldquoBut over and above that, just as the First Minister felt with her own adviser [former Chief Medical Officer Dr Catherine Calderwood] that the focus had to be not on the actions of that inidual, but on tackling the virus. So that has to be the absolute priority.Askedhe believed Mr Cummingrsquos explanation, the Eastwood MSP said: ldquoThatrsquos a matter for the Prime Minister to discuss. I didnrsquot find aspects of it wholly convincing.He also agreed he would struggle to justy his behaviour to his constituents.ldquoThat is why I felt he should have considered his position, which is what I would have done had I been in his position.AskedMr Cummings was a fit person to be advising the Prime Minister. Mr Carlaw did not defend the aide, but said: ldquoThatrsquos a decision for the Prime Minister.ldquoIrsquom the leader of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party. Irsquom not responsible for the decisions of who th Prime Minister employs. Irsquom responsible for the party here in Scotland.He said he had made his feelings about Mr Cummings clear to Downing Street, but had not spoken directly to the Prime Minister about the issue."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June ,  at : amTest and Protect — the national strategy aimed at managing the spread of COVID- and breaking the chain of transmission — is formally underway in Orkney.

While the ious schemes put in place have been a welcome response by the UK and Scottish Governments, far too many tourism businesses have continued to fall through the gaps.“The requirement for applicants to have a standalone business bank account has proved particularly problematic.  Certainly it has prevented support reaching precisely the sort of businesses who need it most, including BBs.“I have been raising this point repeatedly with Ministers in recent weeks, including during discussions with the Finance Secretary earlier this week. To her credit, Kate Forbes accepted the unfairness in excluding so many genuine tourism businesses and agreed to review the position.  I welcome the fact that this review has led to a change that will give more local BBs the chance to access the support they need.“There are certainly more gaps that require to be filled, and I will continue to make the case on their behalf.  Meantime, for many BB businesses in Orkney, I’m sure there will be a sense of relief at this decision.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, we are asking you, for now, to please stay within, or close to, your own local area. And don’t use public transport unless it is absolutely necessary.”The first steps out of lockdown could only involve “careful and cautious” changes, she said.In Orkney, this means that travel on public bus and inter-island ferry and air services will continue to be for essential reasons only during Phase One, with passenger numbers severely restricted as a result of and in line with social distancing requirements.Across Scotland it is assessed that social distancing will reduce transport capacity by  per cent –  per cent and this figure is very much in line with the assessment in Orkney for our ferries and local bus services.During Phase One, there will be no changes to the current timetables for local bus, ferry and inter-island air services.For Orkney Ferries, the aim is to help protect residents in the isles from the risk of infection – along with the crews who operate the service – and to ensure that the ferries can continue to run and deliver freight and other essential supplies.The Scottish Government’s new guidance, published on Tuesday , will help public transport operators and passengers prepare for the further lting of lockdown restrictions at a future date.Detailed information from the government on the newly announced Public Transport Guidance has been sent to the council. Careful consideration is being given to how this might apply locally when the move to Phase Two begins.The guidance does state that people should wear face coverings when using public transport and further information on the council’s expectations on this will be provided in due course.The government has acknowledged that there will be geographic challenges in implementing the guidance and that there can be no ‘one size fits all’ to the approach taken across Scotland.The government’s latest travel advice is available here: https:www.transport.gov.scot coronavirus-covid- transport-transition-plan advice-on-how-to-travel-safely copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If a planning application is subsequently submitted, neighbour notication and publicity will be undertaken, and iniduals and communities will have an opportunity to make representations on that application to the planning authority at that time.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Orcadian has made continued appeals to for the figures to be made public, along with other key figures relating to the outbreak in Orkney, and members of the wider community have called for transparency when it comes to way the crisis is being managed in the county.As it stands, Orkney has recorded eight test-positive cases of coronavirus, but no figure is available for the number of tests which have actually been conducted within the county.Now, it appears that regular updates on the number of folk being tested in each health board area in Scotland will soon be made available.Responding to a question put forward by Mr McArthur on the matter at today#s Topical Questions at Holyrood, health secretary Jeane Freeman indicated that information on tests conducted through NHS controlled facilities will be available shortly, subject to quality assurance. She explained: “We’re working to make sure that we give as clear and as robust data as we can possibly can and, as soon as we’re ready to publish that, and with what frequency we will update it, I’ll make sure Mr McArthur knows that.”Responding to this confirmation from Ms Freeman, the Orkney MSP said: “With test and protect already up and running and some restrictions now being eased, it is even more critical that the public are equipped with accurate, reliable and timely information so that they can make informed decisions going forward. “The number of confirmed COVID cases and COVID-related deaths are already published daily, but the public are still being left in the dark about the level of testing taking place.  Without these figures, it is impossible for anyone to make sense of what is happening on the ground.  “Being open and transparent about testing numbers is crucial to building public trust and confidence which, ultimately, is a key component in keeping our communities safe as we begin to ease restrictions over time.  “The First Minister not only agreed with me this point but also gave an assurance that ministers would now consider how to make this data available. “The Health Secretary has now provided her own assurance that the information will be available shortly. This needs to happen now, however, as the continued delays are doing nothing to help build public confidence at a time when people are desperately looking for clarity.” copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It also indicates there will be further major costs from Brexit for years to come and also highlights that without an extension or having a free trade deal in place, Scotland’s agriculture, fisheries and manufacturing sectors will be especially badly hit.Ms Todd said: “Coronavirus is causing enormous economic disruption and people across the Highlands  Islands expect government to be focused on protecting public health and the Scottish economy.“It would be an act of extraordinary recklessness for the UK government to allow us to crash out of the transition period at the end of this year.“The SNP believe the best future for Scotland is as an independent member of the EU.“But regardless of your opinion on Brexit or independence, it makes no sense to crash out of the European single market at precisely the moment we need stability.“Businesses in the Highlands  Islands are focused on securing their future — they simply don’t have the capacity to prepare for Brexit on top of a pandemic.“The UK government must do the sensible thing, protect jobs in the Highlands and Islands and extend the transition period.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That team collectively raised nearly poundk, keeping the team flying for almost three days. So, we’re delighted to be able to offer this again, supported by Boost Drinks. Our supporters are looking forward to walking our beautul peaks after necessary lockdown protocols are eased and our events partner at Le will work with us around any necessary social distancing requirements that are needed. We’re also delighted to have the virtual option available for those who wish to register that way now, orcircumstances mean it’s needed for all,” Kerry added.Air Ambulance NI brings urgent medical assistance to anywhere in the province, operating seven days a week for  hours per day. It can get to anywhere in Northern Ireland in approximately twenty-five minutes. This Doctor   Paramedic service benefits those whose lives are at serious risk following signicant injury or trauma. Effectively the service brings emergency hospital care direct to the casualty.“We are thrilled to help launch the Three Peaks Challenge  in partnership with Air Ambulance NI that will raise funds for a le-saving service available to the Northern Ireland public should they need it,” said Kim Jacks, Boost Drinks’ Consumer Brand Manager.“As our  charity partner we are supporting Air Ambulance NI and encourage people of all abilities to take part and do something very worthwhile. “You can walk at your own pace and spend quality time with friends and family – which I know will be greatly appreciated after a tough start to the year,” continued Kim.The registration fee per location   peak costs pound or pound to register for all three. Participants are asked to fundraise a minimum of pound each to help keep the service operational.

The emotional wellbeing and welfare of your daughter and of our staff is paramount.A relaxation on school unorm policy will also be in place, as children would not be attending every day.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePrincipal Bronagh McVeigh FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPrincipal Bronagh McVeighSaint Vincent de Paul head Bronagh McVeigh set out a proposed new weekly timetable.Primary Six and Seven pupils taking the transfer test wouldat some point in August, attending four days a week from .am to pm.Primary One and Two pupils would attend one day a week for reduced hours from August  until the end of September.Pupils in Primary Three, Four, Five and Seven, who aren#t taking the transfer test, will attend two days a week.Sacred Heart Boys# principal Joanne Smyth told parents the new term would likely mean a mix of learning in school and at home.This will mean that your son will be attending school on certain days of the week with a small group of children from his class. Currently we anticipate this to be two days a week, she said.As the school year ended abruptly, Sacred Heart is aiming to have pupils resume lessons with their previous teacher in August before changing to their new class in the middle of September.This will help ease children#s anxiety and also prepare them better for transition to their new teacher for the year ahead, Ms Smyth said.During this time the teacher will be developing social and emotional lessons with an emphasis on improving positive wellbeing.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePrincipal Keith Wysner FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPrincipal Keith WysnerWhiteabbey Primary School head Keith Wysner said he has yet to make arrangements, saying it would be too dficult to anticipate the official guidance.We haven#t tried to second guess any of what#s happening, obviously we#re keeping an eye on things but we don#t know whether pupils will have to be one or two metres apart, he said.Just like with restaurants and hotels, that detail will make a world of dference to what we can do in school.Mr Wysner said it was crucially important that any guidance will make staff and parents feel safe.There is a Dutch model, which encourages the children to come in and be together, as the coronavirus to date has had very little impact on that age group.I can potentially see how that would work for our children. But they would still need to remain two metres apart from adults.A part of educating children is socialising them and allowing them to play and cooperate together.Ulster Unionist education spokesman Robbie Butler MLA said a number of schools and parents had expressed their frustration at the ongoing uncertainty.The minister has given a commitment to release guidance this month and said it could change at any time, he said.However, we know what the threats are and what the strategies are needed in public. So, we could already be giving a range of scenarios to schools to help them to prepare.Meanwhile, Ulster Unionist peer Lord Rogan has criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnson for not doing more to help schools open safely in devolved regions.He has shown no inclination to use the vastly superior resources of the UK Government to properly support our schools in the dficult task of reopening later this year, he said. As the months go by, it is becoming increasingly clear that he has no desire to take responsibility for anything.

More shops at its retail park section will be open next week, such as Argos and Currys.However, in the short term only outlets with direct street access or direct access within a retail park are allowed to open - which rules out many non-essential outlets in shopping centres such as fashion retailers.Rushmere says it already has well-established social distancing practices, with one-way systems, live footfall cameras, floor stickers to mark two-metre gaps and heightened hygiene measures.It is in a category of shopping centres which have fared relatively well during lockdown because of its essential shops. But for other centres which are dominated by fashion and leisure offerings such as restaurants and coffee shops, it may be a dferent matter.Gone will be the pattern of shopping centre visits in the past - a leisurely dander through Primark or Next, followed by spontaneous visits to other shops, rounded off with a cappuccino and cupcake in a coffee shop.Instead, we are likely to face prolonged queues for the most popular stores - and once inside, there will be one-way systems restricting our way around. And the popularity of stores like Primark could mean that you will have to book a visit in advance.After all that queuing and bulk-buying, you might fancy a coffee and a sit-down - that could mean even more queuing outside the coffee shop, especiallyits capacity is cut from  tables to  in order to maintain social distancing.You might think, I#ll sit down on a mall seat for a rest instead. But as Peter Murray of Newry#s Buttercrane Shopping Centre has said, mall seats have been taken away, which means no lingering.The role of shopping as a family expedition might also change - stores which have to restrict numbers may not want a family group of five taking up space. The only customer who counts is the one with the buying power, rather than the bored kids.Many stores rely on impulse buys to bump up average spend - but there will be less scope for impulse.However, the hassle of queuing may mean that people do more planning ahead, therefore more bulk-buying could take place. There are just a small number of essential retailers open in CastleCourt Shopping Centre in Belfast, such as Halax, Holland  Barrett and Superdrug. It usually has around . million visitors a year. Across the city centre, Victoria Square is closed as it has no #essential# retailers. The big question, too, for both centres is whether office workersto the city centre in large numbers.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThey have been a destination for retail therapy for years - but one observer remarks that there may be more anxiety in shopping centre trips of the future FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThey have been a destination for retail therapy for years - but one observer remarks that there may be more anxiety in shopping centre trips of the futureOur observer says: Locations that have the most essential retailers and are more community centres are the ones that will do better long-term. Yes, footfall may be down % but at least they have maintained shoppers and their shopping habits.The big issue iseveryone stays at home and doesn#t go back to the big urban areas to work shops and shopping centres will all be affected. You might normally have , transient workers and students in a city centre, butthat goes down to ,, that has the biggest impact of all.The physical layout of stores may also be dferent. With fewer people allowed in at a time, retailers might adjust the space for actual shopping, and instead increase their storage space - especially since goods which have been ed will need to be quarantined to make sure they#re virus-free before theyto the shop floor. Changing rooms are already out of bounds.Of course, plenty of us are die-hard shoppers and nothing will put us off spending our money when we#re allowed to do so in brick-and-mortar stores rather than online. It might just take a bit more planning than before.

I have come through chemotherapy treatment so well and I am looking forward now to getting on with some #grannying#, the proud and very excited new granny said.The hardest thing for me is not so much missing out on cuddles.Read MoreEditor#s Viewpoint:Opinion Meeting two sets of twins will be a magical momentI will eventually be able to cuddle them. It is that feeling of your child having a child and you are not able to help your child - that is what I am finding tough.I would love to be able to go and help. I think of these new mummies and daddies with these twins all needing an extra pair of hands and those hands should be mine.Mrs Lindsay said she feels blessed that in the middle of this pandemic, she has so much to be thankful for.When you consider all the people who have died from Covid and how their loved ones were not able to be with them, we feel so thankful for all that we have, she said.My cancer treatment went really well and the staff at the hospital who looked after me were incredible. It was the same for Kate and Sarah and the babies - they had the best of care and attention, so we have so much to be grateful for which is why I am not going to complain about missing out on the cuddles because I know they will come.We knew from September that Kate was having twins but when Sarah went for her first scan, she was asked, #How do you feel about having twins #Sarah laughed and said, #My sister is having twins#, and the person doing the scan said, #I think you are too# - so we are just wondering where all these twins came from.For now both Kate and Sarah are having to cope with being first time mums to twins without the on hands-on guidance of the mother beside them.Kate said: Hugo had some complications after he was born and spent three weeks in the Royal so I really missed not having mum beside me then. But we are lucky we live in a digital world so we were able to have constant contact.In a way though because these are our first children, we didn#t know any dferent so as my mother would say we just got on with it.I think because I relied so much on Ben, as I couldn#t have mum with me, it made us stronger and he has been very hands on because there was no other choice.Sarah added: It took a long time to get used to the idea that I was having twins, especially after finding out Kate was having twins, but it is lovely that they is just seven weeks dference between them.Mum had five of us so there#s not much she doesn#t know about babies but at least she is at the other end of the telephone but ready with good advice and guidance.I had thought she would have been able to be here so I could at least get a couple of hours sleep in between feeds though.Becoming a granny to four darling bundles of joy in a matter of weeks isn#t the end of the excitement within the Lindsay family - Marie and Collie#s other three children are all in the midst of wedding plans.Marie continued: Our son Lee and his fiancee Nikki were due to get married in Dublin this August but that has been deferred now until March because of the coronavirus.Our youngest daughter Fionnuala and her fiance Ross will be getting married in Decemberall goes according to plan, and our other son Denis and his fiancee Maria are planning to get married next April.So we have plenty of family gatherings to look forward to between all these christenings and weddings.

We also know that the IFA is a salaried organisation and brings in a considerable amount of money to the Northern Ireland economy on an annual basis, but it also has a wage bill of £m.That is particularly problematic when you don#t have any gate receipts as a result of games not happening.Sport NI is working to quanty that at the minute. This is right across  governing bodies of sport where they#ve had to cancel competitions soincome from those events, loss of third party investments through sponsorship and the volunteer workforce. One football club alone has identied their volunteer workforce is worth £m a year so it#s incredibly dficult to put a price on it.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNorthern Ireland Football League FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNorthern Ireland Football LeagueMs McKeown added that Sport NI will be opening a £m National Lottery fund at the end of June for sports clubs and is expecting it to be heavily oversubscribed, but the body is working with the DfC to find additional funding.Committee chair, DUP MLA Paula Bradley, said she cannot get her head around why the Sports Hardship Fund closed just  hours after it opened.Ms McKeown said she understood the frustration from sporting groups. She added: To have continued to keep that fund open when we had surpassed the amount of money in the budget to deal with that would have been really poor governance practice. We were also very conscious of distracting local clubs from their volunteering work and stunting their attempts of survival. To distract them by filling in applications - even though it was a simple application - at a time when we knew we#d no money, we felt was unfair and actually disingenuous. Having discussed it with the department and the Communities Minister , we took the very dficult decision of actually suspending any new applications to the fund.Sport NI is now awaiting the approval of £, worth of funding, which will deal with outstanding applications. It is also working with the Department for the Economy to allow sporting organisations to apply for grants that were previously unavailable to them.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseUlster Rugby FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappUlster Rugby  Belfast   Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Public asked to consider staycation to help virus-hit tourism industryTyrone midwe chosen for cover of Vogue #never thought they would be bothered with the likes of me#George Floyd death: Hundreds of Belfast protestors vow to make NI racism free zoneTributes flood in for #bubbly and funny# social media star Kailum O#Connorafter tragic deathTears of joy as Co Antrim teachers visit pupils ahead of learning #big school# fate,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsAn INM Websitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty"},{"url":null,"title":"i want to see a lot more face masks worn in public northern irelands chief scientist tells stormont","story":"descriptionpinPlease confirm to access your content OK\",template_summary: Order summaryNeed help  Contact Customer CareAccountBillingConfirmation.epplans:not .epplans-more .eporder-box .eporder-box.-new .eporder.is-new .eporder-box.-new .eporder.is-new .eporder-box.-select .field .StripeElement .field .StripeElement--focus #fp-payment-form .button selected_price\" class\"-as: -c:dt -fw:\"View other plansother_pricescoupon_codeSelect payment methodNew Cardother_payment_optionsPayment detailsCard NumberExpiration DateCVVComplete paymentLockSecure transaction\" class\"-as: -c:dt -fw:\"ArrowleftSelect a dferent payment method,template_summary_coupon_code: \"Coupon Codecoupon_validationRedeem Code\",template_summary_coupon_code_applied: \"Coupon Code Applied\",template_premium_fadeout: \"\",card_number_style: stripeInputStyle,card_expiry_style: stripeInputStyle,card_cvc_style: stripeInputStyle, prices,template_prices_price: badge_textPremiumPremium+price_to_display*Billed as one payment of price_to_display_billedprice_to_display_frequencydescriptionsididSubscribe,template_summary: Order summaryNeed help  Contact Customer CareAccountBillingConfirmation.epplans:not .epplans-more .eporder-box .eporder-box.-new .eporder.is-new .eporder-box.-new .eporder.is-new .eporder-box.-select .field .StripeElement .field .StripeElement--focus #fp-payment-form .button selected_price\" class\"-as: -c:dt -fw:\"View other plansother_pricescoupon_codeSelect payment methodNew Cardother_payment_optionsPayment detailsCard NumberExpiration DateCVVComplete paymentLockSecure transaction\" class\"-as: -c:dt -fw:\"ArrowleftSelect a dferent payment method,template_confirmation: .c-box-wrap  p pricesYou re currently a Premium subscriberTo change your subscription, please contact Customer Care on +    or by emailing customersupport@belfasttelegraph.,window.IMP  window.IMP  window.dataLayer  window.dataLayer  window.IMP  flipPayConfig let previouslySelectedPriceId  localStorage.getItemlet listeningForGigyaEvents  let addToCartFiredAfterRegistration  let userHasLoggedIn  let productImpressionRecorded  let productClickSource  localStorage.getItemconst userHasValidSubscriberCookie  .subscriptionStatusconst getBundleById []const getSubscriptionStatus  .filter -.map []const isGrantedBy  -const listenForFlipPayEvents The extra space after access_resolved is NOT a typo, that is how the event is fired from flip-pay.js.Show all elements that were being hidden from non-subscribers.document.getElementsByClassName.forEach   inline-block: block User is not a subscriber -

I#m almost the only person wearing a mask when I#m in the supermarket. People should be wearing a cloth face covering when they#re in an enclosed location.Prof Young was also asked about the efficacy of taking peoples# temperature when they arrive at work.He voiced concern over the measure which he said has limited value in preventing the spread of the virus.Referring to a review of monitoring temperature, Prof Young said: It suggests that we may pick up a quarter of people who are currently infectious through checking temperature, but at the price of identying a lot of people who aren#t infectious and telling them to go home and isolate.It#s open to manipulationpeople wish to do it. They can put a cold face cloth over their face or take a couple of paracetamol, although I hope that people don#t do these sorts of things.It#s something that may have some value but we don#t think it#s particularly useful at the moment.Last month, Prof Sian Grfiths, who co-chaired the Hong Kong government#s inquiry into the  Sars outbreak, recommended that people in Northern Ireland should wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of Covid-.I think they may contribute to protecting other people who come into close contact with you, said Prof Grfiths.

Malone Rugby Club, which is based on the Cregagh Road, has also offered its clubhouse and pitch facilities on an interim basis to the club, she said.About  members have been signed up and there are more emails and responses that we haven#t been able to deal with yet, said Mrs Ervine. It#s a cross-community initiative and the founders come from a GAA and rugby background and are very passionate about both sports and cross-community engagement with both sports.The club hopes to field a team in the Down junior championship this year.A new GAA club for East Belfast,you#re interested in playing, coaching or adminAll ages, genders and backgrounds welcome. Please email EastBelfastGAA@gmail to register— EastBelfastGAAMay , Co Down native David McGreevy is one of those involved, having played Gaelic football for London in the  Connaught final.Mr McGreevy also plays football for his home club of Teconnaught, near Downpatrick, and rugby for Belfast-based Instonians.The last GAA club of its kind to play at adult level in east Belfast, St Colmcille#s GAC, was disbanded in the s. Mrs Ervine, sister-in-law of the late PUP leader David Ervine, said the establishment of a new GAA club represents ato normality and they had been flooded with offers of support.[The GAA club] was lost with the Troubles, so for me it#s very much about normality ing to the area and people moving on  odd years after the Good Friday Agreement.There have also been offers of help from dferent organisations and sporting groups. People have been really good and schools also want to get involved.It#s been fantastic and a really positive vibe.Daithi MacRaibhaigh is one of the founding members of the club and said the response he received when he first Tweeted about the idea was far beyond what he expected. I wasn#t expecting this thing to get so big. At this moment we#re looking at organising men and women football teams, camogie and hurling teams, and underage sides as well, he said, speaking to BBC Sport. And because we are promoting this as a cross community project, several primary schools including some from the integrated sector have been in touch.He is now preparing for the club#s inaugural meeting and creating a newsletter to email out to supporters.Mr MacRaibhaigh said the club#s name, East Belfast GAC, will remain unless the members decide they want to change it but said he thinks it would be appropriate to consider naming the club after someone from the east side of the city.His friend Richard Maguire had made the original suggestion of forming a team and said he was taken aback by the degree of interest.Daithi messaged me on Sunday morning askingI wanted to be part of a wee team in East Belfast. I was thinking that a casual kick-about would be great, said Mr Maguire.I thought there are enough people living around east Belfast who can#t travel to their other clubs, but might want to play. It#s good to explore these things. However, I didn#t see it having so much support so quickly. By two o#clock on Sunday, I had enough people to field a team, said Mr MacRaibhaigh.The Bredagh and Carryduff clubs in south Belfast and St Paul#s in Holywood have sent us emails saying they are keen to help us outEast Belfast GAC will come under the authority of the Down County board, who have said they will offer any guidance needed.It#s positive news that they want to field a cross community team, said the board secretary, Sean Og McAteer.In the current climate where there are no activities on the playing fields, the fact that people want to launch Gaelic games again in east Belfast is very welcome.

Christine Chivers depiction of match day in Lavey is as majestic as the clubs sports hall is eye-catching. If you were writing a letter to Santa, asking for something your community is craving for right now, this is it. An array of goodness, colour and atmosphere. A hub of activity depicted to the very last detail by Christine, a retired art teacher. The love of her craft hasnt diminished one iota. Even the stanchions on the goalposts have been added, at the request of her husband Paddy, the clubs chairman, after he scanned over it for one last time. googletag.cmd.push Like families across the world, lockdown changed the shape of Christines week. The school runs have disappeared, caring for their grandchildren put to an end by a need for social distancing, her golf and helping around Lavey club also halted. “The club gates were locked up and I missed calling in there every day,” Christine commented. “Paddy could always have found an excuse to call in and attend to something or other. I enjoyed helping with reception duties and keeping our amazing facilities clean and tidy.” Until now. Updating her family photo albums is part of the new routine. When it was her turn to add to Damians collection, an football action photo set her creative mind wandering. googletag.cmd.push “He featured in a photograph taken by Mary K Burke for the County Derry Post. The high catch in this photograph inspired me to paint the ‘Love Our Club, Love Lavey’ painting,” Christine reveals. “I was old-school and when we grew up, we enjoyed the high catch – I just thought that was a fabulous skill and I liked that picture. “I was going to do a painting of that, but then I thought Ill do the whole club because we are missing the club. I put in the pitch and I just kept adding to it, I put the supporters in and I kept putting more and more detail into it. I really enjoyed doing it.” She took photos of the clubhouse and the pitch to help her with the overall scaling. “I was trying to capture the colour, excitement and special atmosphere of match days,” Christine explains. “The only part of the painting that is from an actual game is the high catch at midfield. The rest of the players and supporters are imagined, although I did model two of the younger supporters on Eimear and Aodhan my grandchildren, who are underage players and keen fans.” Her love and interest in sport isnt something recent. Christine, originally from Swatragh, is from the Quinn family steeped in the GAA. Her sisters Bernie , Patsyand Sarahanneall had distinguished camogie careers. The family was also immersed in Scoacuter, football and hurling. “My younger brothers, Roddy A, Adrian and Iggy, hurled for club and county. My older brother, Dickie, played senior football and for many years continued as a dedicated member of the thirds,” Christine explains. “GAA was a constant topic of conversation in our house and it continues to be so, with many of my nieces and nephews starring on club and county. “Sundays were always match days in Ballynian where I grew up,” she adds. The field at the back of the house was flat, goalposts were put up and the pitch was marked out and all. “Jim B Bradley and lots of cousins came over over, two teams were picked and we had some great games of football, hurling and camogie. “All the boys and girls played all codes. Sarahanne turned out to be the best hurler and camogie player and was always a first pick. “A highlight was mammy bringing out the plate of orange segments at half time. The sun always seemed to shine then and we have some great memories.” Christines artistic passion also grew. When the Far East magazine arrived at home, the colouring in competitions were done and sent away. “And the very few times, you would win something from it.” she remembers. “I was always interested in it, right from primary school.” Like many schools, reading, writing and arithmetic were the order of the day at the local St Johns in Swatragh, but when Maura McKenna came in as a student teacher in Primary , Christines love for art deepened even more. “We did art competitions, it was brilliant and I can remember it to this day – I really enjoyed it,” Christine said, with total enthusiasm. “I went to Loreto in Coleraine and it was such a fabulous place for anybody to go to, for anybody who was interested in art. “The art department was down at the road, in a lodge and was separate to the rest of the school. There were so many opportunities.” She was lucky to have TP Flanagan, who painted pieces for Seamus Heaney, as a tutor in St Mary’s Teacher Training College in Belfast. In , Christine joined the Art and Design Department in St Mary’s Grammar School, Magherafelt, where she was popular with her pupils, one of whom remarked how she was always smiling, an example of someone revelling in their job. BBC Broadcaster Thomas Niblock is a past pupil and always remembers Christines first words when he stepped into the school in first year. “Someday you will all travel the globe, make your way in the world and decorate your own homes,” she would tell them. “My job is to provide you all with a true appreciation of art and the joy it can bring,” Thomas remembers. “To a -year-old, that felt like million miles from where I was, but I remember her saying it. It stuck,” states Thomas. “Her teaching  percent instilled that appreciation and education that will stay with me for le. More importantly, a lovely human-being and it was a privilege to be taught by her.” Christine spent her teaching le in the school - over  very happy years, something she labels as a privilege. “To work with so many exceptional staff and students, I couldnt explain how happy I was going to work every day, the children were so talented and such lovely children to work with.” In retirement, art has certainly not being left to one side and she has painted many local settings, such as Moyola Park Golf Club and the recently refurbished Lavey chapel. As we talk on the phone, Christina is heading for her first round of golf in eight weeks. Her husband Paddy has been a member there all his le. “They did lessons for ladies four years ago. We have had great fun and we were the first ladies team to win an Ulster medal for Moyola.” In recent years, the painting hasnt been as plentul, but now she is back in full flow. “I particularly enjoy painting with oils and have previously painted many scenes in my locality, including local homesteads, local bars and places of interest. “I knew I wanted to include our amazing clubhouse in the composition, Christine said of her most recent masterpiece. “I miss the excitement and camaraderie of match days and I tried to capture that by adding players and supporters. I took a few photographs of the pitch and the clubhouse. “The weather was kind and I set my easel outside the back of the house. It was really enjoyable getting the oil paints out and painting outside, while listening to my favourite album, Neil Diamond’s ‘OriginalHot August Night’ from .” It was a work of art and a labour of love, all rolled into one. Not one to be rushed. A glance at the images around this feature showcases the level of detail required to fully depict a scene. Doing it justice is the most important thing. “It seemed to take forever - the painstaking level of detail required me to use tiny, No , paintbrushes,” she explains. “I thought I had it perfect and was ready to pack up my paints when Paddy came along and said where are the stanchions, so I had a little more to do. “Painting is such an enjoyable experience, especially at a time like this when you have lots of time on your hands - to start with a blank canvas, draw and paint and create something.” Christine points to the other people in the locality and their creative side. Drawings, paintings, sketches, poems, songs and stories have all been produced depicting their Love for Lavey. “In Lavey, we are incredibly proud of that group in our community who got together  years ago and built our state-of-the-art facilities,” Christine adds. “Everyone in the parish benefits from the healthy lestyle that Erin’s Own Club and Termoneeny Community association has to offer and the friendships that develop there too.” She points to the minors winning the football and hurling double, a group that added an Ulster football title – giving great hope for the future. “We look forward to the day when our weekly activities all begin again, the walking, cycling and running groups,” Christine concludes. “Mary’s baby massage and yoga classes, Thomasina’s mindfulness sessions, Parish events, Mary’s Young at Heart groups, local PS events, local schools coaching and competitions, Anne’s yoga and spinning sessions, Darragh and Katrina’s circuits.” A litany of a le currently on hold. When Lavey parish s from the wilderness, the characters in Christines paintings will burst back into le, all in the perfect colour in which they have been depicted. Love your community.

Mickey Boyle, Paddy McGurk and Stephen Murtagh won’t get the credit they deserve for moulding their young team into national champions, writes Cahair OKane. They won’t care about credit. The only currency was the piece of silverware that Tiernan Rafferty got his hands on before coolly asking his principal for a day off school.To put the success into context. Dunshaughlin is a town of , people, and is home to the Community College that houses almost  pupils.St Paul’s Kilrea is a school of hardly  pupils. They came through the Derry championship without Benny Quigg and Enda McFerran, and were without Gary Keane for their All-Ireland semi-final. For every Ben Nevis they climbed since the adventure began in October, they were faced with a Kilimanjaro on the other side. googletag.cmd.push They travelled to the home of Ulster football on a hiding to nothing. Instead, the Derry school handed out the hiding. There was not a single man, woman nor child who could have had any complaint about Kilrea claiming All-Ireland medals. Some of these young players will go on and have county careers. Some will have good club careers. Some won’t even make it to senior football. That’s how le in the GAA is. But when the paper clippings are sodden in a cardboard box in the attics of Benny Quigg and Cahal Bradley and the rest, the  who togged out in the light blue of St. Paul’s will have the comfort of a national medal to cling to. No-one will ever take that away. googletag.cmd.push And nor will they be able to dispute that it was anything but thoroughly deserved. Gary Keane salvaged extra-time against Castlewellan in the Ulster semi-final. He was then sent off in the final and missed the All-Ireland semi-final. His suspension ran out just in time to allow him to play the final. What a godsend that was for Kilrea, with his - from play to land the All-Ireland.But it was not a one-man operation. Look at the Kilrea scorers list – all of the front six registered, and all six of them did it from play. Some of their football was a joy to behold. Their ability to y their style kept Dunshaughlin guessing. One minute it was a high searching ball for Keane, the next it was a diagonal ball for Conor McKenna or the outstanding Enda McFerran to latch on to. Their midfield diamond took the Meath men to the cleaners. Denver Johnston kicked two points from midfield but was outshone by a superb display of second half fielding from the instantly recognisable Cahal Bradley. Kilrea conceded just - and only for the most fleeting of moments did they ever look like losing control of the game. By the th minute, Quigg had three points to his name as they led - to -.Only for an outstanding double save by Andrew Smyth from Conor McKenna, it would have been more. Regardless, the job was already half done. The Leinstermen had no answers.Enda McFerran was hauled down inside the area but Benny Quigg saw his penalty smartly saved by Smyth. Within four minutes, Ryan Davis had sent an unstoppable -yard rocket to the roof of the Kilrea net and the doubt might have started to surface. Had Eoin Kinsella netted a great chance just seconds later, it would have become a two-point game, but he sliced horribly wide. Step forward Keane. The Cryuff turn hasn’t been seen on many GAA patches but the young full-forward perfected it before flicking the ball brilliantly up without bending his back. Sean Burke wasn’t strong enough and the green flag was promptly fluttering. A brilliant finish from Ian Gillett into the top corner renewed Dunshaughlin hopes, making it - to -, but it was never going to happen. Kilrea scored four points on the spin, just as they had done in the first half, before Keane bustled his way through to slide home the deciding goal off his left boot as injury-time loomed. The scoreline wasn’t flattering to St. Paul’s. They could have won it by more. And to think that just four weeks previously, they were  seconds from exiting Ulster. The funny world of football.

The Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt RevAndrew Forster, joined scores of parishioners from the Parish of St Augustine’s and further afield for the service at Bishop Street car park in the city centre on Sunday morning to mark Pentecost Day. The service,which took place in glorious sunshine,was led by the Rector of St Augustines - ‘The Wee Church on the Walls’ -Rev Nigel Cairns. The car park adjoins St Augustine’s Parish Hall and is opposite the city’s courthouse. A team of volunteers, dressed in ‘high-vis’ vests and PPE gear, oversaw a one-way, ‘car ferry’ type system, that meant cars were directed in one entrance and out bya dferent route after the service. googletag.cmd.push Social-distancing guidelines required all those present to remain in their cars during worship, and parish volunteers ensured that none of the worshippers fell victim to the soaring temperature. Bishop Andrew, who preached the sermon,welcomed the congregation to what he called his ‘back garden’ . He said: St Augustine’s was known as ‘the Wee Church on the Walls’. Today, we’re the wee church without walls. I always think about St Augustine’s as the wee Church with a big heart and today we’re showing our big heart because we’re together, worshipping God on this Pentecost Sunday. googletag.cmd.push “This is definitely a first for me,” the Bishop said, “and I would imagine it’s a first for many of you as well, but God is here and we worship him in spirit and in truth.” Rev Cairns echoed Bishop Forster’s welcome to the first ‘Drive-through Church’ in the inner city, and thanked all those who had helped make the service possible. He said the St Augustine’s parishioners would be gathering for worship in the same location again next Sunday.

Ronan Valley Golf Course, a ‘pay and play’ facility outside Magherafelt, has seen its numbers rise by ‘% more than normal’ since it reopened, with people from all around flocking to the venue. Owner Peter Tohill says the fact that the club does not operate a membership system has been an advantage. “We’re a pay and play facility, we don’t have members so we weren’t bound by the Golf Union of Irelandrules,” he said. “The rules that apply are the government’s social distancing guidelines and using proper hygiene and that type of thing. googletag.cmd.push “That’s why we didn’t have to operate a booking system, you just turn up. It’s worked quite well so far, we opened last Wednesday and we’ve been incredibly busy. “We have people coming from all over the north. We’ve had golfers here this week from Belfast, even Newtownards. Omagh, Derry city, people who wouldn’t normally have been with us.” Although it was relaunched in , Ronan Valley had operated before World War II, but the outbreak of war saw interest wane and the course closed soon afterwards. While the prolonged spell of fine weather is bringing the crowds back, it is not without its drawbacks. googletag.cmd.push “We don’t have an irrigation system so it’s a bit dry,” said Peter. “There’s a lot of work being done in the early hours of the morning with regards watering and cutting. It’s too busy to get work done during the day! “Last year, from the th July until Christmas, there weren’t three dry days in a row. Normally it would take a few dry days in a row before people would even start to think about golf. “The longer the good spell of weather goes on, the more people want to come and play.” Staff at the venue have been taking every precaution to prevent the spread of Covid-, with sanitisation stations dotted throughout the course. Flags and hole cups have also been sanitised and a strict policy of social distancing is in place for everyone using the course. Peter says they haven’t had to work too hard to enforce it. “I was worried before we started, but people have been absolutely brilliant,” he said. “Avid golfers will be members somewhere, so they would tend not to play here, but a lot of them are having dficulty getting into their own clubs with the booking system that’s been operating. “People are just so happy to be out, so they stick to the guidelines and don’t mind the wait. Sometimes they’re waiting about twenty minutes to get teed off. “We’re saying ‘sorry about the wait’ and they say, ‘we’re standing here, we’re outside, we’re able to talk to our friends at a distance and we’re happy enough.’ “I can’t complain, it’s working for us!”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Yesterday, the Northern Ireland Executive announced that hotels and tourist accommodation could reopen from July , but bars and restaurants are yet to receive a date. Finvola Hassan, from McReynold’s Bar in Dungiven, said those working in the hospitality industry need time to prepare for reopening. “We need them to give us a date because we’ll need three or four weeks to get everything sorted, for ordering and getting things ready,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I’m looking at stuff at the minute for getting the bar ready, but the social distance is m. We would nearly need m or .m. Our bar isn’t small but it’s not big either. “You don’t want to spoil your bar either, because a lot of bars have character and charm. If we could get it down to a metre or a metre and a half, it would be a big help. “We have the beer garden out the back too, so we’ll do something more with that. You have to kind of think outside the box when it comes to this. googletag.cmd.push “It’s going to be tough. You could only get about a third of your customers in, but the date is so important.” Hospitality Ulster have called for the Northern Ireland Executive to provide a date on which businesses in the sector can reopen, saying the current situation puts them at a ‘competitive disadvantage to their counterparts in England, Scotland and Wales. “Many hospitality businesses in the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland have dates for reopening, and we are now at a competitive disadvantage,” they said. “We do not want to reopen until it is safe, but the Northern Ireland Executive must now look at when we can reopen based on our safety mitigation. “Leaving us in phase five, with theof full-service public transport, suggests that we cannot introduce safety measures, which is simply untrue. “We will be in a position to demonstrate how we can operate safely. It is really now important we get firm dates around bars and restaurants, whether they be in hotels or outside them.” Finvola is confident of being able to introduce the required safety measures when the date does come. She said: “No one will be allowed to sit around the counter anymore, and there can’t be more than six people in a group at the minute. “You’ll be constantly cleaning, and bars might need doormen that never had them before. People will probably have to book a table too. “We are lucky, because we have two bars, so people could come in one door and out the other. I’ve already been in the bar just looking at how we can change things. “We’re fourth generation, we don’t really want the likes of Covid to close us down. You have to fight on. “Most pubs have their locals and their loyal customers. You don’t want to let them down and you’re looking forward to seeing them again.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Yesterday, the Northern Ireland Executive announced that hotels and tourist accommodation could reopen from July , but bars and restaurants are yet to receive a date. Finvola Hassan, from McReynold’s Bar in Dungiven, said those working in the hospitality industry need time to prepare for reopening. “We need them to give us a date because we’ll need three or four weeks to get everything sorted, for ordering and getting things ready,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I’m looking at stuff at the minute for getting the bar ready, but the social distance is m. We would nearly need m or .m. Our bar isn’t small but it’s not big either. “You don’t want to spoil your bar either, because a lot of bars have character and charm. If we could get it down to a metre or a metre and a half, it would be a big help. “We have the beer garden out the back too, so we’ll do something more with that. You have to kind of think outside the box when it comes to this. googletag.cmd.push “It’s going to be tough. You could only get about a third of your customers in, but the date is so important.” Hospitality Ulster have called for the Northern Ireland Executive to provide a date on which businesses in the sector can reopen, saying the current situation puts them at a ‘competitive disadvantage to their counterparts in England, Scotland and Wales. “Many hospitality businesses in the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland have dates for reopening, and we are now at a competitive disadvantage,” they said. “We do not want to reopen until it is safe, but the Northern Ireland Executive must now look at when we can reopen based on our safety mitigation. “Leaving us in phase five, with theof full-service public transport, suggests that we cannot introduce safety measures, which is simply untrue. “We will be in a position to demonstrate how we can operate safely. It is really now important we get firm dates around bars and restaurants, whether they be in hotels or outside them.” Finvola is confident of being able to introduce the required safety measures when the date does come. She said: “No one will be allowed to sit around the counter anymore, and there can’t be more than six people in a group at the minute. “You’ll be constantly cleaning, and bars might need doormen that never had them before. People will probably have to book a table too. “We are lucky, because we have two bars, so people could come in one door and out the other. I’ve already been in the bar just looking at how we can change things. “We’re fourth generation, we don’t really want the likes of Covid to close us down. You have to fight on. “Most pubs have their locals and their loyal customers. You don’t want to let them down and you’re looking forward to seeing them again.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Almost  resources which showcase the rich cultural heritage of the Causeway Coast and Glens council area have been brought together for the first time. The Heritage Audit was carried out as part of the PEACE IV Understanding Our Area programme by Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council Museum Services. It uncovered a range of trails, publications and other resources which combine to create an invaluable tool which tells the story of the region. Congratulating all involved in the project, Councillor Orla Beattie, Chair of the Peace IV Partnership said: “The Heritage Audit rightly identies that while we live in a Borough globally renowned for sites like the Giants Causeway and Bushmills Distillery, its history and heritage is vibrant, proud and local and spans centuries. googletag.cmd.push “The inclusion of sites, places, heritage trails and historic churches is a credit to the curators of our local heritage, local people and committed volunteers. This audit is a repository that can grow and develop further, not to mention the huge Peace idend that can come from a project such as this. Heritage and local history as a discussion point or opportunity to explore is, and will remain, an important and valid Peace-building tool. “Finally, much appreciation and gratitude must be shown to the SEUPB for making this publication a reality under Peace IV, the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councils Museums Services for enabling its delivery, to Abarta Heritage for its expertise in pulling this all together so beautully and, finally, to the participants of this project, who will continue to keep their local heritage alive through their dedication and passion. googletag.cmd.push The Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council Councillor Sean Bateson said: “On behalf of council, I would like to highlight the huge contribution which PEACE IV funding is having on communities in Causeway Coast and Glens. The PEACE IV programme has seen investment across the area and this Heritage Audit is one of many important resources for the future produced under the Understanding Our Area programme. The resource is available now and I would encourage everyone to explore the contents and immerse yourself in the story of our fascinating area.” Details of each resource have been added to an interactive map, creating an online information hub where visitors can readily access and experience the stories of the area. The full audit and map are available for free viawww.niarchive.org audit If you are aware of a community heritage resource that is not included, please get in touch with Museum Services by emailingcms@ causewaycoastandglens.gov.uk  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Parents of Primary  childrenwho are due to sit the tests later thisyear are demanding answers. The Derry News this week contacted local grammar schools Lumen Christi, St Columbs College, Thornhill College and Foyle College on this issue.  However, none of the schools made a statement about their plans. Last Friday, five Catholic grammar schools in Co. Down announced they would not be using transfer tests to choose their admissions for . It comes after Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown, sent a letter to Catholic post-primary schools inDerry,in his role as a trustee of Catholic schools in the diocese,asking for the transfer test to be scrapped this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. googletag.cmd.push The leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland, Derry-born Archbishop of Armagh Eamon Martin echoedthis sentiment, saying it would be in the bestinterests of children that the tests did not go ahead. However, Education Minister Peter Weir rejected their calls, stating there was no viable alternative to the transfer tests. Last week, the principal of St Eithnes Primary School in Derry, Terence McDowell, spoke to the Derry News and called for the transfer tests to be done away with this year as it had not been possible to prepare pupils in the normal way. Mr McDowell pointed out that circumstances in pupils homescan y greatly and would impact on their parents ability tohome schoolthem. googletag.cmd.push The article struck a chord with a number of parents at the school, who are now calling on the grammar schools to announce their decision on the matter. Sharon Downey, whose daughter Olivia is in Primary , said the lack of clarity is adding to the anxiety caused to children and their families. We need to know the answer, she said. The schools need to make a decision so weknow whats happening one way or the other. We are sitting here doing our best to teach our children and getting them to sit practice tests and it might be for nothing. It would make you concerned about their mental health. Karen McDevitt, who is mum to Primary  pupil Sally, said she feels her daughter, who is just -years-old, is being let down. The anxiety levels are through the roof for parents and children, she said. If they have agreed to scrap the GCSE, A-Levels and AS Level exams this year, then why would you let them go ahead for these young children  Ms McDevitt, who is working from home and homeschooling her daughter at the same time, said it has been extremely challenging. We are just muddling through. Its very dficult as there are topics in the tests that they havent evencovered yet. They will be starting Primary  in September having missed around  weeks of school. When they do go back in September they probably wont be in for a full day so they will be losing out again. Aisling Robinson, whose daughter Molly is also in Primary , agrees: My daughter has been confined to the house. She is used to learning from a teacher with her friends around herfor support. The ways thingsare taught have changed a lot since I was at school so it is very dficult. These children have all the anxiety of living through a pandemic but then all the pressure and uncertainty of the transfer test situation on top of that again. I want her to keep her mind active and do her work because she still has to prepare to go to big school, butwe were told the transfer tests werent going ahead it would be a big relief.

Mr McDowell pointed out that circumstances in pupils homescan y greatly and would impact on their parents ability tohome schoolthem. googletag.cmd.push The article struck a chord with a number of parents at the school, who are now calling on the grammar schools to announce their decision on the matter. Sharon Downey, whose daughter Olivia is in Primary , said the lack of clarity is adding to the anxiety caused to children and their families. We need to know the answer, she said. The schools need to make a decision so weknow whats happening one way or the other. We are sitting here doing our best to teach our children and getting them to sit practice tests and it might be for nothing. It would make you concerned about their mental health. Karen McDevitt, who is mum to Primary  pupil Sally, said she feels her daughter, who is just -years-old, is being let down. The anxiety levels are through the roof for parents and children, she said. If they have agreed to scrap the GCSE, A-Levels and AS Level exams this year, then why would you let them go ahead for these young children  Ms McDevitt, who is working from home and homeschooling her daughter at the same time, said it has been extremely challenging. We are just muddling through. Its very dficult as there are topics in the tests that they havent evencovered yet. They will be starting Primary  in September having missed around  weeks of school. When they do go back in September they probably wont be in for a full day so they will be losing out again. Aisling Robinson, whose daughter Molly is also in Primary , agrees: My daughter has been confined to the house. She is used to learning from a teacher with her friends around herfor support. The ways thingsare taught have changed a lot since I was at school so it is very dficult. These children have all the anxiety of living through a pandemic but then all the pressure and uncertainty of the transfer test situation on top of that again. I want her to keep her mind active and do her work because she still has to prepare to go to big school, butwe were told the transfer tests werent going ahead it would be a big relief.

The Minister had previously announced that an array of active travel initiatives would be implemented across Northern Ireland. Pilots have already commenced in Belfast and the next phase will see the roll out in Derry and Newry. Announcing further details of the new measures to be implemented in Derry City, Minister Mallon said:“Last month when I announced the creation of a Walking and Cycling Champion within my Department, I said that I intended to move quickly in making changes on the ground. googletag.cmd.push I want us to seize the chance for change with the current reduction in traffic levels and build real momentum. I am committed to changing the way we live for the better, providing safe routes that give people the freedom and confidence to walk and cycle as part of their everyday routine “Pilot schemes have already hit the ground running in Belfast and I am delighted today to take the next step in my plan to trial sustainable, green infrastructure by announcing further details of plans for Derry. The Minister said she had worked with Derry City andStrabane District Council to identy an effective temporary scheme which takes advantage of the council’s car park and the existing road network to ensure the popular riverside route can continue to be used safely by pedestrians and cyclists. googletag.cmd.push “In conjunction with the Council, my Department will implement a series of temporary walking and cycling measures along the riverfront between the Queens Quay Roundaboutand Foyleside roundabout.

Along Foyle Embankment from Harbour Square Roundabout to Foyleside Roundabout, a traffic lane will be converted to a two-way pop-up cycle lane. These measures will allow the people of Derry to continue to enjoy the riverside walk and cycleway safely whilst maintaining social distancing as we learn to live with the challenges of covid-. Minister Mallon said this was just a small step. I’ll be looking at more options for the city, seeking to maximise its potential, using infrastructure to transform lives for the better. Some of the changes we will make have not been tested before. They may not all work, but we have an opportunity now to try new things and to learn from them. Now is the time to be bold and to be ambitious. I know the people of the North West have waited a long time to see change and I am determined to deliver it in partnership with council and communities. My Department will be flexible and responsive but it will not be afraid to try new approaches. I’m grateful for the support from the Council - by continuing to work collaboratively we can make real improvements to the lives of our citizens, open up opportunities and deliver lasting change.” Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Cllr Brian Tierney welcomed the Department’s announcement and its creative and innovative plans to create more public space for walking and cycling along the city’s riverfront area. He said the works will greatly facilitate social distancing and assist business who are reopening by reducing traffic, creating more space and instilling public confidence. Cllr Tierney said: “The Council is very supportive of this work and believe it will encourage active and safe modes of travel and provide the public with more space and improve their experience as I know that signicant numbers of residents have begun to walk and cycle more at this dficult time. “We believe that this project will provide assurance to the public and will assist our businesses in planning for social distancing as they prepare to open again in the coming weeks and months.

Oran Kearney, who managed Higgins for two seasons at Coleraine, felt he was a player that would stay in the game and tips him to do a great job for Ireland.

There will be a few wildcards that hewont have worked with before. googletag.cmd.push “Also, you can see why he has stuck with two or three of his Dundalk back-room staff, who he trusts imperatively and that is very important going forward.” Higgins began his playing career with local side Newtowne FC, before being signed by Coventry City, where he spent six seasons before being released in . The  year-old was snapped up by Derry City, where he spent five years and won four League Cups in a row and the FAI Cup in , Kennys last game in his first stint as Candystripes boss. Higgins spent a season in Dublin with Bohemians, before being brought back to the Brandywell by Kenny. googletag.cmd.push Higgins flicked on goalkeeper Gerard Dohertys kick forward to create Rory Pattersons winner in an - extra-time FAI Cup triumph over St Pats in . Higgins was then signed by Kenny at Dundalk, were he won the league and cup double in . After a spell with Coleraine, he ed to Oriel Park to join Kennys management team and was the opposition analyst when Dundalk won the  title, before being promoted to assistant manager. He was very much in demand, and was muted as a target to succeed Kearney after his switch to St Mirren. “He was brilliant around the changing room,” Kearney commented of Higgins two seasons as a Coleraine regular. The current Bannsiders boss isnt surprised his former player has stayed the game and pursued an avenue in management. “Ruaidhri, to be fair, was always one of those guys who you have a fair idea would remain involved in the game because he has all the credentials and, as Stephen Kenny mentioned through the week, is a real student of the game. “He is somebody who is very passionate about how he keeps on top of things and everything that is going on. “It is great for him and I am delighted to see him get that post and I am sure he will do a great job.” As one of the senior players, Higgins was someone Kearney would have sounded out ideas on. “Hewould have been the first to tell you that mobility wouldnt have been his strongest asset. His biggest strength was in his mind, he was probably yards ahead of other players. He was a very intelligent player and you can see why he has carried that on. “There would be senior pros in the changing room, that you definitely bounce ideas off or get feedback from. Ruaidhri was one of those guys who was quick to ask questions, in a good way. It is a sign of an open mind and that he was keen to push on.” Kenny was the Irish U boss and due to succeed Mick McCarthy after Euro , but with Covid- forcing the postponement of the competition, the FAI acted to promote Kenny to the senior manager post. Ireland must navigate the play-offs, beginning with a semi-final clash with Slovakia, with Northern Ireland or Bosnia-Herzegovina awaiting them on the other side. Before that, Kenny and his new management team continue to prepare for a UEFA Nations League visit to Bulgaria in September, their first game in charge.

They are open from pm to pm, Monday to Friday.ldquoWhile we are open again we are operating under strict guidelines with one-ways systems in place, designated seating areas and a maximum of eight people in the church at any one time, he said.ldquoI had hoped to reintroduce a limited number of sacramentals such as confession and benediction in Kilcoo, as this parish have had very little in the way of services over the last few years due to a shortage of priests. However, diocesan officials have cautioned against it, just now.Fr McKinley, who has been parish priest at Kilmegan for ten years, continued: ldquoThe virus came upon us out to the blue. It was a whopping surprise to all of us. Thirty years of the Troubles didnrsquot close us down but I suppose we all just have to put up with it as these are unprecedented times.Despite the first steps being taken to open churches Fr McKinley cautioned it could be quite some time before the parishes could resume their normal schedule.ldquoSt Malachyrsquos in Castlewellan holds over  people. I foresee it wonrsquot be any time soon before we are able to facilitate anything like that number, said Fr McKinley has had to reschedule  weddings and postpone First Communions and confirmations until later in the year.He added: ldquoIt is an eerie and uncomfortable feeling to celebrate Mass in an empty church and I long for the day we will see our churches full to capacity once more.ldquoHowever, while the obligation to attend Sunday Mass has been temporarily lted Masses are still available on the parish webcam for everyone to view.Magheradroll Church of Ireland Church in Ballynahinch will be open for one hour each Thursday, starting next week.Canon Warren Russell, rector, said: ldquoI welcome the reopening of the church in line with the recommendations made by the Northern Ireland Assembly.ldquoWe will open from am to noon on a Thursday which coincides with market day in the town.ldquoWe want to reassure people that all possible safety measures will be in place to facilitate the opening and provide a quiet space for prayer and reflection once again.ldquoThere will be masks, disposable gloves and hand sanitiser available at the back of the church for people to use.Canon Russell, who has been rector for the past  years, added: ldquoWe will measure the response and review it again in a few weeks.

But with the COVID- restrictions Irsquove decided to take the challenge on Zwt to avoid any risk of burdening the health service.Proceeds from the challenge will go to the mental health charities Aware and Ballynahinch Counselling Services, also known as The Hub.ldquoOur lives have been turned upside down with the COVID- pandemic and many people are finding it dficult to cope with the changes, health concerns and isolation of it all, Alan continued.ldquoMental health issues can affect anyone and looking after our mental health is key to our overall emotional and physical wellbeing.ldquoSo far Irsquove raised almost pound and would really like to get to pound.

He then raised the alarm with their parents, Valerie and Declan senior, who rushed to be with their son.Paramedics were quickly on to the scene, but on the way to Belfastrsquos Royal Victoria Hospital , the teenager needed a le-saving blood transfusion due to his major internal injuries.The ambulance was met in Greyabbey by a doctor and the emergency helicopter team where the procedure was carried out before Declan continued on to hospital by air.The Year  student from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School, Downpatrick, later underwent eight hours of surgery to save him.Two and a half weeks later, Declan was back at home recovering with his family and vowing to get back on to a tractor as soon as he is fit and able.Eoin, who also attends St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick, wants to give another person a chance of survival.He has started a Just Giving appeal to fund the provincersquos helicopter emergency medical serviceand raise at least the pound, it costs to run it per day. The family has now raised nearly pound,, including gt aid for the service as their thanks for saving Declan.Mrs Keating says her son has a ldquolong road to recovery with rehabilitation and further surgery down the line but they are ldquoforever indebted to the air ambulance and the entire hospital team who cared for Declan. She said surgeons told her that he was ldquoextremely lucky as the accident could have had fatal consequences.Reliving the morning of the accident when Declan mdash whose nickname is lsquoThe Milkmanrsquo mdash and Eoin had just left home to go their unclersquos farm for the milking at am, is still traumatic for Mrs Keating.She said: ldquoI donrsquot like to think about what happened to Declan. For what happened and how it happened, itrsquos nothing short of a miracle for him to be here. We were told thathis injuries had been one centimetre one way or the other, it could have been a lot worst. There were terrible injuries but at least there was no injury to his head or spine head.ldquoIt was just a freak accident and hopefully nothing like this will ever happen again. However, Declan has told me that he will be back in the tractor as soon as he can walk.Mrs Keating said Declan had passed his tractor driving test late last year and was used to driving their tractor to her brotherrsquos nearby dairy farm.ldquoThe boys had set off from home and were literally just yards down the road when the accident happened,ldquo she continued. ldquoWe are not sure how but Declan said that one minute he was driving and the next he was flung out the side door onto the road and the tractor ran over him.ldquoThe tractor continued moving and Eoin managed to get it stopped and immediately checked on Declan and called his daddy.ldquoDeclan was fully conscious and realised he was badly injured. He checkedhis legs and arms worked. He thought that his pelvis was broken and wanted to seehe was paralysed and somehow managed to get himself up and walk over to the other verge before his legs gave way. He was sitting up when me and his father arrived at the scene.Mrs Keating said that while both Declan and Eoin were naturally shocked by what had happened, she was proud of both her sonsrsquo presence of mind during the horric accident.ldquoEoin called us  seconds after the accident and we were there within minutes, she said. ldquoDeclan was alert the whole time when the ambulance and paramedics arrived.Mrs Keating and her husband followed behind the ambulance as Declan was rushed to the RVH. An emergency doctor met the ambulance in Kircubbin before continuing on. However, the parents feared the worst when the ambulance pulled over at the tennis courts in Greyabbey.ldquoThe doctor jumped out of the ambulance and told us not to worry, Declan was OK. He was going to give him a blood transfusion as he was losing blood internally and the air ambulance was on its way. Literally, it seemed the helicopter arrived just seconds later and Declan was transferred by air then to the hospital.Mrs Keating said that the blood transfusion was vital to Declan at that time, adding: ldquoFor remote communities where we live, the air ambulance is an essential service. They only have started carrying blood supplies earlier this year. If he hadnrsquot have gotten the blood, he may not have been here.Declanrsquos injuries were found to be signicant. He sustained a broken pelvis, perforated bladder and bowel, a collapsed lung, three broken ribs, internal bleeding and bruising.Mrs Keating said: ldquoThe accident and emergency doctor said he would have expected anyone  to be in a critical condition with the range of injuries but Declan was in a serious condition which showed us what a fighter he was and he wasnrsquot letting it get the better of him. We took some comfort from this at that time.She said that three teams of specialist surgeons operated on Declan for more than eight hours to deal with his major injuries.ldquoThe surgeons were extremely worried about Declan and I kept askinghe was going to be OK. The surgeon would only say that he was out of immediate danger and that the next - hours would be critical, she said.Declan spent three nights in intensive care before moving into another ward. Mrs Keating said that the care Declan received was ldquofirst-class and spoke of how caring the medics were to their plight.ldquoDeclanrsquos father and I wanted to be with him through the night. At one point the ward sister called us over and offered us the sleep room the surgeons use for rest during their sht. They gave up that room for us for three nights so we could be with Declan and we saw just how busy they all were. We thank them from the bottom of our hearts for their kindness.The family say they were overwhelmed by the support and well wishes they received from their local community and their donations to the appeal.Mrs Keating added: ldquoDeclan will recover and he canrsquot wait to be up again at am every morning to help on the farm as he just loves the farming le. The air ambulance was the legacy of Dr John Hinds [the late emergency medicine specialist] and it would be remiss of me not to remember him and what he did for others during his le and his campaign to get the service. We are forever indebted to him and the air ambulance service for saving Declanrsquos le.ldquoRegarding farm accidents in Northern Ireland, we know we are one of the more fortunate families and we are so thankful. I hope people continue to give money as itrsquos a vital service for the whole of Northern Ireland.To donate go to www.justgiving fundraising eoin-keating..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C May 27%2C 2000  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH ndash Residents at a Ballynahinch housing estate are due to hold talks with a range of key officials this morning in a bid to raise the profile of the area.People from the Hillcrest Drive area in the town are due to meet with senior officials from the Housing Executive, Down Council and the Department of Environment.The meeting comes in the wake of recent vandalism attacks in the Windmill Street area which damaged a number of cars, homes and business properties.Prior to this morningrsquos meeting, residents met with local councillor Anne McAleenan to discuss their concerns and prepare for the crucial talks with the representatives of the statutory agencies.Last weekend, the local councillor discussed with residents their concerns and advised them to draw up a strategy and work closely with the ious agencies who could provide them with key assistance.One of the main concerns is an area at the top of Hillcrest Drive which residents would like to see the Department of Environment cleaning up to enhance the image of the area.In addition, residents are calling for environmental improvements and also believe sealing off the rear of the estate from the lough area could prevent trouble at weekends.KILLYLEAGH ndash The impact a young Killyleagh footballer is having on the international soccer stage was praised at Monday nightrsquos meeting of Down Council.Killyleagh councillor Sam Osborne highlighted the achievements of  year-old David Healy who marked his Northern Ireland debut with a brace against Luxembourg and another strike against Malta.Mr Osborne said the young Manchester United star was a great ambassador for the area and last week received the international personality of the year award at the annual Northern Ireland soccer writers awards sponsored by Guinness.The local councillor said Healyrsquos success for Manchester United and the Northern Ireland team was a great boost for the area.ARDGLASS ndash An Ardglass couple are waging a war against hostile waters in an attempt to circumnavigate Ireland for charity.Rhonda and Vincent Kearney set sail in their -foot boat, Invinceable, on Saturday to make their way around Ireland in a bid to raise pound, to help buy a new leboat.And while the duo is no stranger to challenge, both sailors admit they face a fearsome feat.Vincent is a former Red Arrow and a stunt motorcyclist, while his we, Rhonda, is the former British clay pigeon shooting champion, but nothing, they say, could prepare them for the journey they are now making.ldquoWe only concocted the plan three months ago and thought we had better act quickly before we have time to think about what we are letting ourselves in for, said Vincent.ldquoI have been sailing on and off for about  years and have owned boats for quite some time, but it will still be extremely dficult, particularly with the dreadful weather forecasts we have been given.

Even so, there is a palpable sense of joy among the golfing fraternity.St Patrickrsquos Golf Club in Downpatrick resumed last Wednesday and the captain, Robert McCausland, said he ldquowas absolutely delighted.ldquoThe club is very pleased to be up and running again, he remarked.ldquoWe are very grateful to our green keepers who continued with their work during the lockdown and have delivered a golf course in magnicent condition for the members to enjoy.Mr McCausland said the club was now open to new members and that there were a ldquonumber of very attractive offers in place for those who may wish to take up the game of golf.He added: ldquoThe time sheets over the last few days are quite full and the car park has been busy with lots of smiling, happy faces about the club.Wednesday also saw the reopening of Ardglass Club and Paul Vaughan, the clubrsquos director of golf, said the course has been full up ever since.ldquoOur members have been playing in three-balls and going off every  minutes. We havenrsquot had a spare space since we re-opened, he said.ldquoEveryone is delighted to be back and itrsquos great to see so many people about. I think our members were glad to get out of the house and back on to the golf course.ldquoWe have a marshal at the front gate and the members are obeying the all the guidelines so that they can play casual golf.Mr Vaughan said the loss of visitors represented the loss of a major source of income for the club, but hoped this would be offset by new members.ldquoWe have had a lot of enquiries about new members, but visitorsrsquo green fees are a huge part of our business, he said.ldquoHopefully, we will be able to salvage something towards the end of the season and things willto something near normal next year.At Spa Golf Club, near Ballynahinch, which re-opened on Friday, the captain, Gordon Martin said everyone was ldquoexcited at the expectation of getting back playing in a sport we love so much.He went on: ldquoI am very aware of the sacrices many people have made in our communities that allows us to get to this point. May I on behalf of Spa Golf Club members and their families thank all the heros in out communities.ldquoSpa recognises the great responsibility golf has in being one of the first sports to re-open after the lockdown and fully intends to adhere to all the protocols agreed by our governing body.He said the club had been fortunate to be able to keep some greens staff working at the club over the lockdown period.ldquoThe driest April on record put extra burdens on green keeping staff in terms of additional watering and essential maintenance. But we are pleased to say the course is looking just magnicent.Mr Martin also said it has been a dficult period from a financial point of view with not many golf clubs being eligible for any signicant assistance under the ious Covid finance packages.Bright Castle Golf Club, which is privately owned by the Ennis family, has also been busy since it re-opened last Thursday.ldquoThe course is looking magnicent and the members are enjoying it, said Linda Ennis.ldquoItrsquos been a tough few months, but wersquove worked hard to keep the course maintained to a high standard and itrsquos really looking the part.ldquoThe members are glad to be out playing and itrsquos great to see so many happy faces.ldquoThe last time the course was closed this long was about six or seven years ago and that was because of heavy show. It was a bit disheartening having the place empty in April and earlier this month when the weather was lovely.She added: We rely on visitors and societies for a good portion of our income, but we have had enquiries about new memberships, which is good news for us.Crossgar Golf Club president Paddy Bell heaped praise on the clubrsquos green keeping staff for having the course in great shape and also revealed there has been a surge in new members.ldquoWe have had a big uptake in new members in the past few weeks, which will help compensate for the lack of green fees, he said.ldquoWe re-opened last Wednesday and itrsquos fantastic to see people playing again. It gives you hope that everything may soonto normality.ldquoThe course is in great condition and thatrsquos due to the green keeping staff who have worked hard during the lockdown. All praise is due them.Temple Golf Club has also been inundated with membership enquiries. Since it re-opened last week it has welcomed  new junior members.Owner Tim Martin said the pandemic lockdown couldnrsquot have come at a worse time with membership subions due on April .ldquoAs like every other club, our income disappeared overnight. We depend heavily on the income from the restaurant and bar and our cash flow dwindled rapidly, Mr Martin said.ldquoWe were only able to continue paying our staff each week because of some of the loyal members who paid their fees on time. To them we are very grateful. This kept us ticking over until the government job retention scheme kicked in.Mr Martin said the members had been very accommodating and were adhering to the guidelines and protocols.ldquoWe look forward to progressing into the next stage, but will have to make sure it will be financially viable to open the restaurant and bar when the time comes, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Loughinisland man Gerry praises Move More initiative  ","story":"THERE are not many who have been to the top of the majestic Efel Tower in France.But Loughinisland man Gerry Morgan is one of the lucky few who have made it to the summit to snatch a birdrsquos eye view of the stunning Parisian landscape.That was  years ago when he opted for the easy option by popping into the lt and by-passing the , steps. Just recently, Gerry made it back to the top of the famous landmark again mdash only this time he did it from the comfort of his own home.A decade ago, Gerry enjoyed good health and loved every minute of his visit to France but in  Loughinisland GACrsquos hard-working secretary contracted lung cancer, having never smoked a day in his le.In September that year, surgeons removed one of his lungs and between then and Christmas Gerry received chemotherapy treatment to assist his road to recovery.As a result of his illness, he was referred to Macmillanrsquos lsquoMove Morersquo initiative at Down Leisure Centre in Downpatrick, which is specically designed to help people to get active and stay active with physical activity during and after most types of cancer treatment.Under the watchful eye of initiative co-ordinator Laura McGrath, Gerry loved the camaraderie of being with others referred by medical staff to take part in physical activity which can help educe the side effects of treatment, prevent the occurrence of other long-term conditions and reduce the risk of cancer spreading or ing.ldquoThere were just four of us at the start, recalled Gerry. ldquoWe started off in the old leisure centre which was subsequently replaced by a more modern building and there are now around  people who take part.ldquoWe all look forward to the classes every Thursday morning and after our warm-up routine we then proceed around a circuit and spend time on ious equipment, including a rowing machine. We also do sit-ups and squats.After the exercise regime it is time for a coffee and a chat, which all the Move More participants thoroughly enjoy.ldquoWe are literally one big family as many of us have been through cancer and fortunately come out the other side. In a way, illness has brought us together, continued Gerry.But everything changed in March when the arrival of the coronavirus forced Newry, Mourne and Down Council to close all its leisure centres and public buildings.To keep everyone involved, Laura mdash one of  Move More coordinators funded by Macmillan in every council area across the province to support those living with cancer mdash created an app to enable people to keep in touch remotely and exercise at home.She also recently unveiled a new initiative encouraging people living with cancer to virtually climb their way around some of the worldrsquos top landmarks to stay active during the coronavirus pandemic, without leaving the comfort of their own homes.Laura said that while Move More members were not able to physically travel the world at the moment, there was no limit to their imagination.Participants were given the choice of a number of buildings to scale, including Londonrsquos imposing Big Ben.Not surprisingly, Gerry opted to head back to the top of the Efel Tower, only this time he didnrsquot have to leave his front door during the virtual challenge. He set off at a leisurely pace and over three days and, with a little je nous said quoi, made it to the top.ldquoI could have completed the climb in two days, but decided to do it over three instead, he joked. ldquoI really enjoyed doing it, but miss being with my Move More friends.Gerry is pleased that while face-to-face classes and appointments are not possible, Laura has been working on positive, fun and interesting ways to keep programme participants motivated and active in the comfort of their own surroundings.He is also looking forward to getting back to the Down Leisure Centre when it is safe to do so and the pandemic is no more.Recalling the first time he went to the centre following his referral, Gerry admits that he was a little apprehensive.ldquoI distinctly remember driving to Downpatrick and was so nervous that I almost turned the car around to go back home, he said. ldquoBut I continued on and am so glad that I did. It has been an overwhelmingly positive experience for me, one that I thoroughly enjoy.ldquoI was a bit down for a few years after losing my lung and the chemotherapy, but getting involved with the Move More programme changed everything.

are recommending that a proposal for a major new housing development comprising  new homes at an  acre site on the outskirts of Ballynahinch should proceed.Their recommendation to approve plans for a mixed development comprising a range of detached, semi detached and townhouses on the Lisburn Road will be discussed at next weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee.This particular committee has not met since March as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and to comply with social distancing requirements, the planning meeting will be held at Newry Leisure Centre next Wednesday.In papers submitted ahead of the meeting, the proposed development site mdash which comprises a number of fields mdash is described as ldquoirregular in shape, with the recently constructed Lime Trees, Edengrove and Kinedale developments in close proximity.Planners say that the site earmarked for the new homes is located on the ldquoinner edge of Ballynahinchrsquos development limits, with the area zoned for housing in the Down Area Plan.It is also confirmed in the planning papers that initially, plans were lodged to build  homes, but the figure was subsequently revised after planners expressed concern.The Department for Infrastructure is also content that the proposed housing scheme can be accommodated within the existing roads network.Northern Ireland Water said there is available capacity within the existing sewerage system to cope with the planned new homes, while planning permission has been granted for a new sewage pumping station on adjacent land.The papers indicate that the planning application was submitted in March  and that a number of objections to the proposed development were lodged.Other objections to the proposed housing scheme centre around traffic and access arrangements, claims that the application had not been properly advertised and insufficient neighbourhood notication.Objectors also pointed to the lack of a so-called planting buffer and the ldquolack of effort to integrate an open space area adjacent Ballynahinch River into the proposed development.Another objector highlighted the schemersquos ldquoinappropriate density, arguing that it is greater than other developments closer to the town.The detail of a noise impact assessment submitted to planners has also been questioned, but Newry Mourne and Down Council environmental health officials have expressed satisfaction with the document.The planning papers reveal that an acoustic mound has been incorporated in to the proposed development, with landscaped proposed throughout to mitigate any noise impact on adjacent land uses.In addition, the papers confirm that there is a Tree Preservation Order covering the site and while a number of trees have already been felled, this issue is the subject of an enforcement case.Planners say the proposed development is ldquoappropriate to the character and topography of the site and that ldquoadequate provision is made for public and private open space and landscaped areas as an integral part of the development.They also state that where appropriate, planted areas of discrete groups of trees will be required along site boundaries ldquoin order to soften the visual impact of the development and assist in its integration with the surrounding area, with adequate provision made for parking.Planners say that the development will not have an ldquounacceptable, adverse effect on existing or proposed properties in terms of overlooking, loss of light, overshadowing, noise or other disturbance.Next weekrsquos planning committee meeting takes place two days after the local authorityrsquos annual meeting when it is expected that Rowallane councillor, Robert Burgess, will be

It will help boost the entire thoroughbred industry.ldquoWe very much understand that racing will be behind closed doors for the foreseeable future and will work diligently to comply with the very strict protocols put in place to ensure the safety of all those attending.The July date was announced by the Board of Horse Racing Ireland, which met recently and agreed a number of fixtures for theof race meetings.The first meeting is at Naas on June , with National Hunt racing resuming at Limerick on June .For the first three weeks, racing will be restricted to nine racecourses which are more centrally located to minimise travel distances and which also have higher stable capacities given the requirement for one stable per horse under the new protocols.All the fixtures will take place under the strict protocols published by Horse Racing Ireland.Brian Kavanagh, chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland, said: ldquoWe are grateful to everybody for the patience they have shown during this very dficult time and we will provide every opportunity for essential personnel to fully understand and implement theto racing protocols.ldquoWe expect there to be signicant demand for horses to run once we resume, and we will aim to provide opportunities across the spectrum of age, gender and ability.ldquoWe will have missed  weeksrsquo racing which will take some time to catch up. We intend to do this over the course of the rest of the year rather than immediately.Meanwhile, golf has ed after a two-month lockdown.The Stormont Executive gave clubs the green light to open up last week subject to strict guidelines. Clubhouses remained closed and no visitors are permitted.Tennis clubs have also been given permission to re-open, again subject to protocols being put into operation.However, other sports remain shut down.Restrictions on Gaelic games are likely to stay in place until July  and there will be no inter-county games until October at the earliest.The start to the cricket season has been delayed, but this week the Northern Cricket Union said it hoped to be in a position soon to announce the first step in ato training..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Restrictions begin to ease  ","story":"THERE will be a major easing of lockdown restrictions across the district from today.A number of country parks, harbours, tennis courts and beach car parks will be reopened by Newry, Mourne and Down Council, but strict social distancing measures remain in place with the local authority warning thatthey are not observed, the facilities will be closed.The move to ease some lockdown measures comes after the local authority recently reopened the districtrsquos household recycling centres.But despite the easing of some measures, council campsites, public toilets and cafeacutes across the district remain closed, while mobile vendors are also banned from trading at beaches and forest parks.At last weekrsquos online meeting between the councilrsquos senior management team and the leaders of the local authorityrsquos main parties, agreement to start easing some of the lockdown measures was agreed.Also from today, mountain bike and horse riding trails and the car parks at Castlewellan Forest Park and Tollymore Forest Park will reopen.Public access to the forest parks was agreed two weeks ago, but the car parks remained closed, sparking complaints from residents who live close to both facilities about the number of cars parked along approach roads, hampering sight lines which posed a health and safety risk.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is taking direction from the Northern Ireland Executive on how it slowly starts to ease the lockdown, insisting that progress is determined by public health advice.Two weeks ago, the NI Executive published a five-phase blueprint for lting restrictions but it did not include a timeframe, insisting that it will be guided by scientic and medical advice before it agrees to lt any further restrictions.Local politicians say that they are keen to seen the pathway to recovery progressed, but are reluctant to move too quickly as the virus still has a presence.They are also conscious that with the warm weather predicted to stay, soaring temperatures could place pressure on the districtrsquos hotspots where visitor numbers could increase, as was the case in Newcastle last weekend.With the exception of people who are shielding, visits to immediate family are allowed indoors where social distancing is possible, with churches permitted to open for private prayer, with appropriate social distancing and cleaning of shared contact hard surfaces.However, with groups of four to six people who do not share a household now able to meet outdoors while maintaining social distancing, the local authority feels it is time to allow access to beaches, country parks, harbours and tennis courts.Politicians say they are conscious that easing the lockdown restrictions in one go could push up the all-important R-number, which measures the average rate of transmission.Councillors say the last thing they want is for a situation to arise which would result in having to reimpose lockdown measures and lose the hard won gains that have been made to date.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke and his Rowallane counterpart, Billy Walker, have welcomed the progress being made, but issued a reminder that there will be no leguard facilities at Tyrella beach. However, signs will be in place advising people where it is not safe to swim.The politicians say that council staff will be on duty at beaches, country parks and harbours to ensure required social distancing measures are adhered to. In addition, the number of visitors at the ious facilities will also be monitored, with staff carrying out regular cleaning duties.Cllr Clarke confirmed that local authority staff will be present to engage with the public around guidelines on social distancing and facility information.He said: ldquoWhile these measures will no doubt be welcomed, I would encourage people to be responsible and show consideration for others by continuing to follow the public health guidelines on social distancing and hand hygiene.Cllr Walker said the past two months have been particularly dficult for people across the district.ldquoIt has not been easy and we all hope that people will act responsibly when the beaches, country parks and harbours are reopened. The onus is on them to obey the rules in place which are designed to keep them safe and help prevent the spread of the virus, he continued.Cllr Walker said there were plans to put one-way systems in place, where appropriate, but that all public toilets would remain closed.He added: ldquoI hope that over the coming weeks other facilities will reopen. The fact that we can open beaches and country parks is as a result of local peoplersquos commitment to stay at home to prevent the spread of coronavirus.ldquoWe are making progress and for that to continue it is essential that people continue to adhere to public health advice.

I help my clients achieve their goals by finding that balancebetween nutrition, diet, and exercise.ldquoSome clients, and a lot of men actually, have come to me with problems with anxiety and gut health. For everyone to look after their gut health is something Irsquom verypassionate about.ldquoLast week was Mental Health Awareness Week and I would like people to understand the connection thatwe are feeding our bodies processed food, it can directly impact on our brains and our mental health.Apart from working on her own health and studying to understand what diet and nutrition works for her mdash shersquos vegetarian and stays away from grains, apart from oats and barley mdash Stacey was heavily influenced by holistic approach to health during her late fatherrsquos illness.Mr John Murtagh died in  at the age of  after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer.He was initially told that he has only six months to live and Stacey and her family believe that he helped extend his le through his devotion to nutrition, juicing, mediation and his deepreligious faith.ldquoOnce we heard the news, we researched everything we could to help him nutritionally and holistically, explained Stacey. ldquoWe believe  per cent his faith and his dedication to nutrition and meditation was definitely pertinent to his added time with us. His oncologists thought he was a miracle.ldquoI think it was through what we experienced with my father and my own journey that I knew I wanted to help others nutritionally and how to find their inner happiness and peace.In , she and her brother, Jonathon, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in memory of her dad to raise nearly pound, for Marie Curie.Staceyrsquos own gut health problems were finally diagnosed while she was working in Dubai where she was able to avail of private health service through her job.ldquoI eventually found out that I have visceral hypersensitivity which is typical of IBS and means that the nerves endings in my intestines are exasperated by stress, she said.ldquoMy doctor was very interested in holistic therapies and when he found out that I was doing a lot of HITT [high intensity interval training] but still not losing weight, he recommended switching to lower intensity training such as yoga and Pilates. The dference it has made to my le, along with yoga and a balanced nutritional diet had been incredible.According to Stacey, an open mind and a willingness to test out certain foods to see what triggers your condition are essential for clients to get the right outcome.ldquoJust traditional medicine alone ndash and I would never encourage anyone not to go with traditional medicine ndash is not always the answer. Itrsquos a partnership approach with traditional side and holistic. But most importantly its listening to your own body and what feels right, said Stacey.ldquoClients need to bring a huge trust in the coaching and we really need to work between three to six months and delve quite deep into the personrsquos le to see how we can work together.ldquoIrsquom a big advocate for staying away from fad diets mdash they never worked for me. I believe you have to work to be happy and content within yourself and this is helped by making the right lestyle choices for yourself. Itrsquos about finding balance and what works for you as an inidual and settling into that lestyle.After having a fixed-term contract as a marketing manager before the lockdown, Stacey is no longer working and thinks that this might be the time to push through with yoga and heath coaching full-time.While offering free online yoga classes , Stacey is also offering a complimentary -minute health coaching interview.For further information visit www. staceymurtagh..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

People can continue to use these beautul grounds, but they must recognise the needs of the people who reside there.Cllr Andrews said people in Crossgar were delighted that members of the Passionist Community lived among them and hoped that by everyone following public health advice, it would not be long before some ldquosemblance of normality is restored for everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"UUP’s McKee takes vice chairman role  ","story":"ULSTER Unionist councillor Harold McKee has been selected as the new vice-chairman of Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The race for the deputyrsquos position was between the Mournes councillor mdash a former South Down MLA ndash and Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess.Cllr McKeersquos appointment comes weeks after the SDLP confirmed that another Mournes councillor, Laura Devlin, would be the districtrsquos new first citizen, succeeding Sinn Feinrsquos Charlie Casey.Cllr McKee said that it was an ldquoimmense privilege to have been selected as the local authorityrsquos vice-chairman and is looking forward to his new role.First elected to the former Newry and Mourne Council in , Cllr McKee said he has a proven track record of delivery for the benefit of the local community.ldquoI believe in hard work, honesty and accountability in working with local people to raise and solve issues that they care about in their daily lives, said the incoming vice-chairman.ldquoI know that the community is living through unprecedented times and many people are under huge pressure.

At the newspaper archives in Belfast, David looks at the newspaper articles from the time. David realises he was  days old when he was found: “So this means that for the first couple of weeks of my le someone fed me, clothed me, kept me warm, loved me. Someone genuinely cared.” When David learns he has a full sister who was also abandoned as a baby, he says: “It’s dficult to take it in that the same thing had happened to me happened to my sister. That’s shocking. Why do our parents make the decision to leave us  It’s happened once, so why make the decision again ”David now lives in Birmingham with his we and their three children. He also has four grown up daughters.Helen lives in Navan. She has a son and two daughters.The pair met for the first time in a guest house in Carlingford. David comments: “The only sad thing for me ispolice had been able to put two and two together at the time we could have grown up together. She’s been deprived a brother and I’ve been deprived of a wee sister.”The programme concludes dramatically as Davina McCall reveals to David and Helen the identity of the pair’s parents.Their father was a married Protestant from Dublin who was having an affair with their mother, an unmarried Catholic from Kerry.Their father had  other children with his we before David and then Helen were born out of the affair which spanned many years.David said that their parents dferent religions and the fact the babies were born out of wedlock might have been why they were abandoned.The first part of Long Lost Family: Born Without Trace was shown last night. The second part is on tonight at pm on ITV.It focuses on foundlings – people abandoned as babies, often in the first hours and days of their lives. Born without trace, with no identying information, they have had no way of unlocking the secrets of their past.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

much more than just a parading body and has had a very positive impact in all areas of the county.“Almost as soon as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic became known and lockdown was implemented,

The position of other Eventsec staff will continually be reviewed with the possibility of further staff being required as other recycling centres open not yet determined.“The employment of Eventsec staff to fulfilthese roles has come at no cost to Council since these additional costs are covered by central government funding.”Councillor Causby says he is interested to knowthe money allocated to Council from central government could have been put to use wherein the borough.“There is acentral government fund these Eventsec staff are being paid from what i don’t know yet and what I am waiting on an answer to, isthat money could have been used by Council for something ,” said Cllr Causby.“As councillors we are being asked these questions by constituents. Certainly at the Fairgreen Recycling Centre in Portadown, things are working fairly well now.“On the two occasions I have been down this week there has been no need for EventSec staff, the site has not been swamped, there were very few cars and I was there before midday.“Personally, I thought it strange we still required them, the staff at the site are doing a good job. Whether the staff at the site feel they need the Eventsec staff there I don’t know but at Christmas and New Year we don’t bring them in.“Now, in mine and my party’s opinion, it is time that we trust our staff to manage the sites, we know they are very capable of doing so.”The DUP’s group whip also called on Council to open up all recycling centres and restore them to full operation as soon as possible.“We are also keen to see sitesto full operation capacity and by that we mean all vehicles and all waste types accepted as soon as possible,” said Cllr Causby.“We want a full service resumed as soon as possible and we believe it is safe to do so, particularly with social distancing measures in place.“It is good to see that amenity sites atKeady and Dromore have opened but it is now time other sites are opened as well andwe want to see it sooner rather than later.”Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1591172335641.jpg--couple_say__i_do__in_omagh_s_grange_park.jpg?159117234000","title":"couple say i do in omagh s grange park ","story":"It was a wedding like no other as Julie Ford from Omagh and David Hannaway from Derry exchanged vows in Omaghs Grange Park on Monday morning. The outdoor wedding, the first to take place in the district since the introduction of restrictions in relation to COVID-, was also the first wedding to ever take place in the award winning Council public park. The sun shone on Julie and David as they made their vows in Grange Park to become the new Mr and Mrs Hannaway with the ceremony conducted by Fermanagh and Omagh District Council Registrar, Hazel Alderdice. Speaking about the ceremony, the Councils Registrar, Hazel, said: It was an absolute joy to officiate at Julie and Davids wedding in Grange Park. With the introduction of COVID- restrictions in March, many weddings within the district were cancelled or postponed which was obviously very distressing for all those involved. Following the easing of restrictions in relation to outdoor civil ceremonies the Council applied to have Grange Park listed as an approved venue for outdoor ceremonies so that those wishing to get married at a Council venue within the district could choose between Enniskillen Castle and Grange Park. Grange Park proved to be a lovely location for the wedding and we would like to extend our very best wishes to the new Mr and Mrs Hannaway. Speaking after the wedding ceremony, the new Mrs Hannaway expressed her thanks to the Councils Registrars for their help in arranging the service saying, We are so happy it came together so well. Following the easing of COVID- restrictions, outdoor weddings can take place currently with a maximum of six people in attendance. The Councils Registration Service has been receiving a number of enquiries from couples in relation to having an outdoor wedding since the easing of some restrictions, said Hazel. Our Registrars are pleased to offer information and advice to couples on planning their wedding at this time and we now look forward to conducting more weddings within the district over the coming months, Hazel added.
