Pictured right: As the mother eats some of the food she has found, the baby nurses \u0027You can never predict what will happen since these feedings are mostly a helping hand for ex-residents of rehabilitation centres. Even after being released into the wild they can have some trouble finding food.\u0027This time the first in food queue was the King of this area - a huge alpha male who enjoyed himself eating and definitely was not in a rush. \u0027The power and dominance of a King is so strong that nobody dares to come and get some food until the King finished his meal.              The Orangutan kicks her leg up for a new footing on the tree as the infant finds its own way of holding on dearly to its mother\u0027s fur. The pictures were taken after food was left out for orangutans in the local area as the primates can have difficulty finding sustenance if there are particularly dominant males around \u0027This mother seemed very impatient to eat so she clambered down, grabbed all she could and quickly ran up the tree trunk. That\u0027s the reason you see her arms with different food and you can count at least three oranges in her mouth.\u0027This continued for a while: eating at the top - going down to quickly grab some food and quickly going up again. \u0027The little baby clung onto mum as she clambered through the trees - she even appeared to be taking a nap at one point. \u0027I thought it was just marvellous.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Plaid Cymru confirm positive discussions Lib Dems Greens Remain Alliance","story":"Share this article If Plaid and the Greens had stood candidates it is possible that Jo Swinson\u0027s party would have fallen short and the Conservatives would have held onto the constituency. Mr Price said: \u0027Obviously we have got to respect our members\u0027 feelings and party democracy so that\u0027s part of the reason why we continue to have those discussions. \u0027But I think, in principle, putting the public interest, the national interest, before our narrow party interest really is the right thing to do.\u0027It was reported at the weekend that a Remain Alliance could be in place in up to 60 seats at the coming election.Ms Swinson did not reject that number when asked yesterday as she said \u0027the specifics of announcements will be made in due course\u0027 but it is \u0027well understood that these discussions have been taking place\u0027.

With a multi-million-pound golden goodbye, he won’t need to worry how he’ll pay for his next Happy Meal.But his dismissal has sparked a furious debate over whether, in a post-#MeToo world, the pendulum has swung too far against male bosses.After allegations of sexual abuse against former film producer Harvey Weinstein, companies have rightly been zealous in trying to outlaw unwanted sexual advances and wandering hands in the workplace.       Top boss: Steve Easterbrook is pictured laughing with model Chrissy Teigen at a McDonald’s eventCountless women now feel safer and happier in their jobs as a consequence.But is there a danger of hounding out high-achieving men because of trivial misdemeanours, or even for nothing worse than an office romance? Can a blunt corporate policy ever really do justice to the nuanced, treacherous terrain of modern sexual mores?In the US at the moment, there is a climate of zero tolerance to any behaviour deemed to be a sexual transgression. Chief executives can be ousted not only for groping and grabbing, but also for any relationship with a colleague, even if both parties are single and willing participants.       The view is that it is unacceptable for a CEO to have any relationship at all with a colleague because there is an automatic imbalance of power and therefore potential for exploitation and abuse.We don’t know, and perhaps never will, the true nature of Easterbrook’s liaison with his colleague.He has signed a non-disclosure agreement and hired heavyweight advisers on both sides of the Atlantic – top PR man Fraser Hardie in the UK and Desiree Moore in the US, a lawyer who among other things is an expert in handling ‘celebrity disgrace events’.But whatever the full story, it is an ignominious end to Easterbrook’s career at McDonald’s, which until this point had been a textbook case of upward mobility.Very few Britons reach the top of Wall Street companies. The ascent of 52-year-old Easterbrook to the top at Maccy D’s is all the more remarkable because he comes from an ordinary background.         Easterbrook acknowledged he had a relationship with an unnamed employee in an email to staff, calling it a \u0027mistake\u0027. He is pictured in New York 2017 with Chrissy Teigen, who was the face of the McDonald\u0027s Dollar Menu in the US. She is not the woman with whom Easterbrook had an affair. He grew up in the unprepossessing Hertfortdshire town of Watford, where he attended the local state grammar schoolHe grew up in the unprepossessing Hertfortdshire town of Watford, where he attended the local state grammar school. Although he has been living in Chicago, where McDonald’s has its headquarters, he still loyally supports his hometown team, Watford FC.As a boy, he and a friend would catch a train to Harrow to visit the McDonald’s there, back when the burger chain was still viewed as an aspirational and exotic arrival in Britain.At Durham University, where he studied natural sciences, he showed talent as a spin bowler and played on the cricket team alongside Nasser Hussain, who went on to captain England.Commerce, rather than sport, beckoned on graduation. After training as an accountant with Price Waterhouse, he took his first job at McDonald’s in the 1990s, cutting his teeth as manager of a branch near his home town on the A41.His ascent up the burger-flipping hierarchy – helped by a stint at Hamburger University, the company training academy in Illinois – was rapid. By 2006, he was in charge of the UK business and also became president of northern European operations. In 2011 he briefly left to become chief executive of the Pizza Express and Wagamama restaurant chains, but rejoined McDonald’s in 2013 as global chief brand officer before becoming chief executive two years later.         Steve Easterbrook, then CEO of Mcdonalds UK, pictured with Alesha Dixon and Lord Coe at the London 2012 Olympics.  Under his leadership, McDonald\u0027s share price has almost doubled so that the company is valued on the US stock market at a phenomenal $147billion (£114billion)Coincidentally, he is not the only high-flyer in the family to have had a professional setback recently. His sister-in-law Jill Easterbrook is leaving her job as CEO of fashion firm Boden after a profit warning.Whatever Steve Easterbrook’s bedroom misdemeanours may or may not be, no one disputes that he has delivered in the boardroom.When he took over at McDonald’s, the company was at a low ebb. Under his command, its share price has almost doubled so that the company is valued on the US stock market at a phenomenal $147billion (£114billion).McDonald’s, whose empire sprawls over most corners of the world, is a deeply isive company. Loved by millions of devotees who adore tucking into its quarter-pounders with cheese and Egg McMuffins, it is despised by critics who see it as a downmarket purveyor of calorie-laden junk food.Easterbrook showed an evangelical fervour for overturning the negative stereotypes.He switched to eggs from cage-free hens, antibiotic-free chickens and hormone-free milk. Restaurants were spruced up, healthier options appeared on menus and packaging was made more environmentally friendly.He introduced digital ordering kiosks to cut down on queuing and invested in home delivery services.         Easterbrook\u0027s three daughters remained with their mother Susie, a part-time estate agent and former training boss at PwC, at the £1.3million family home in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire (pictured)         He is pictured outside McDonald\u0027s Corporation new global headquarters, Chicago, US, in June last year. Chief executives have been sacked for relationships with their colleagues across the US, in the wake of his caseKeen to get rid of the slur that staff were stuck in low-paid positions with poor prospects, he raised pay rates above the minimum wage.He even tried, unsuccessfully, to have the derogatory word ‘McJobs’ deleted from the Oxford English Dictionary.In short, he wanted to make McDonald’s a ‘modern progressive burger company’.The problem for him was that it had a very old-fashioned view on relationships.On Wall Street, his departure was greeted with shock. Although McDonald’s most recent quarterly earnings had been disappointing, traders fretted that the company was losing a boss with a fabulous track record.At one stage, the news had knocked $4billion (£3billion) off the company’s market value. Corporate morality, it seems, can come at a steep price.One irony is that if Easterbrook had conducted his affair almost anywhere but the US, he would probably have got away with little more than a raised eyebrow from the chairman and a few sniggers at shareholder meetings.Attitudes in the US to bosses who have liaisons with employees are far more puritanical than in the UK, let alone France or Italy.Countless British bosses have dallied with, or even married, their secretaries, with no backlash whatsoever, at least in their professional lives.The view in Britain, traditionally at least, has been that a chap’s private life is precisely that. Unless he’s used company cash to wine and dine a mistress or committed some other business sin, then shareholders don’t think it’s their concern.Indeed, bosses of large British companies, such as Antonio Horta-Osorio, the married Lloyds boss whose illicit affair was splashed across the front pages a few years ago, can survive salacious and highly public revelations.In the US, however, bosses are expected to be models of marital virtue. This is particularly the case at a company such as McDonald’s, which prides itself on its family values and where mothers, who make the decision whether or not to take the children, might disapprove of a libidinous male CEO.Right or wrong, that’s why the boy-made-good from Hertfordshire has been kicked out from under the Golden Arches. "},{"url":null,"title":"ANDREW PIERCE profiles new Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle","story":"Share this article When he was elected the MP for Chorley in 1997, his second wife, Catherine Swindley, succeeded him as a Labour councillor. As a backbencher he often clashed with Tony Blair, notably over the self-determination of Gibraltar and introduction of student tuition fees. He said of their differences: \u0027I\u0027m not anti-Tony he made us electable and won three times.

I think the tragedy came about because of the cladding, leading to the fire racing up the building, and then was compounded by the \u0027Stay Put\u0027 policy.         Mr Rees-Mogg, 50, was slammed for the \u0027insensitive\u0027 comments on Nick Ferrari\u0027s LBC radio show, with members of the community demanding an apology and declaring he \u0027should be ashamed of himself\u0027\u0027And it seems to me that that is the tragedy of it. The more one\u0027s read over the weekend about the report and about the chances of people surviving, if you just ignore what you\u0027re told and leave you are so much safer.\u0027And I think if either of us were in a fire, whatever the fire brigade said, we would leave the burning building. It just seems the common sense thing to do. And it is such a tragedy that that didn\u0027t happen.\u0027But I don\u0027t think it\u0027s anything to do with race or class, and indeed I think it\u0027s rather sad to raise these types of points over a great tragedy.\u0027Nobody was evil in relation to this great tragedy, but people made mistakes.\u0027And humanity makes mistakes and sometimes they have deeply tragic consequences. But it wasn\u0027t done because people had chips on their shoulder or they were bad people, they just got something terribly, terribly wrong.\u0027 After the first report of the inquiry into the blaze was released, LFB commissioner Ms Cotton has refused to apologise for her \u0027stay put\u0027 commands that night.         London Fire Brigade boss Dany Cotton has faced calls to resign over her \u0027stay put\u0027 policy on the night of the inferno She said sorry for causing \u0027additional hurt\u0027 to families affected, but refused to quit and will instead retire next April with a possible pension of £2million. Miss Cotton said she was \u0027disappointed\u0027 by Grenfell Inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick\u0027s report for criticising named firefighters for their response.She has vowed to stay on, arguing she wanted to \u0027continue to protect the people of London\u0027. The Moore-Bick report concluded that the LFB breached national guidelines over its \u0027gravely inadequate\u0027 preparations and did not have a plan to evacuate the tower.Asked if she would quit, Ms Cotton said: \u0027No, I won\u0027t. I will retire in six months\u0027 time because my commitment is to making those changes, and if I resign I can\u0027t do that.\u0027But Conservative MP Sir Mike Penning, who was a firefighter before he entered politics, said she must carry the can for the fatal advice to residents to \u0027stay put\u0027 in their homes as the blaze took hold.He supported demands by relatives of the 72 people who died for Ms Cotton to leave her post – and said if she refused to do so, London Mayor Sadiq Khan should dismiss her.

Later that year she published a pamphlet, Love and Honour But Not Obey, and fellow campaigner Ethel Wright painted her portrait. Posed in front of her piano, the picture of elegance in an emerald-green silk dress, Dugdale Duval looks nothing like the shabby suffragettes demonised by the Daily Mail. The cockfight kicking off on the gold screen behind her is a satiric allusion to the manners of male MPs.Images of modern femininity feature prominently in this exhibition at Pallant House Gallery. Radical Women: Jessica Dismorr and Her Contemporaries tells the story of a group of early-20th-century female artists in Britain who engaged in progressive art, literature and politics. As the title implies, the star of the show is Dismorr, who despite suffering from mental illness was a pioneer in four modernist movements: rhythm, vorticism, postwar modernist figuration and abstraction. The small but self-assured exhibition traces her and her allies’ lives through paintings, sculptures, graphic art and more.Within a decade of graduating from the Slade School of Fine Art in 1906, Dismorr had joined two groups aligned with the fight for suffrage. Rhythm was characterised by rural scenes rendered with intense and often clashing colours, while vorticism combined a more subdued palette with the fragmentation of cubism and angular imagery lifted from the urban environment. The city may have been a masculine space, but in their art women were free to navigate it as they wished. In Abstract Composition, painted around 1915, Dismorr takes a handful of architectural fragments and rejigs them to create the illusion of depth. Her work was shown alongside that of her good friend Helen Saunders, whose Untitled Drawing – a crush of encased figures – alludes to the imprisonment of pro-suffrage activists.The war sparked a “call to order” that saw artists return to figurative art, a shift that’s evident in the portraits by Dismorr and the other women she exhibited with in the 1920s. But look closer. Dismorr’s Interior (1930) depicts the Frankfort family at their home in Hampstead. Yettie slumps on the edge of a chair with her chin in her hand, a nervous look in her eye. In the foreground is the austere profile of her husband, Henri, whose head is twice the size of Yettie’s and positively dwarfs their doll-like son. When Yettie inquired about the distorted scale, Dismorr said it was a formal decision. Yettie remembered replying: “Formal be damned, this is a symbolical representation of a psychological insight.” The artist apparently grinned and said: “You are right.”Grappling with their position in society, these female artists sought to foster a new a way of life. Winifred Nicholson’s Father and Son is an intimate portrait of her husband, Ben, with their infant son at the kitchen table. In a rare reversal of gender roles, it captures a tender moment as Ben holds his baby close, pressing his lips to his ear. Across the room is Self Portrait by Paule Vézelay, whose arms are raised defiantly above her tilted head. Born Marjorie Watson-Williams, she changed her name when she moved to France in 1926. Though clearly feminine on the page, “Paule” spoken sounds masculine.The third and final room of the exhibition sees Dismorr return to abstraction, which in the 1930s was regarded as international – and, as such, an implicit protest against nationalist sentiment. Here we have a smooth wooden sculpture from Barbara Hepworth, with whom Dismorr exhibited in 1937, and a stone mother and child by Betty Rea. In Dismorr’s library was a copy of 5 on Revolutionary Art, a collection of essays with a foreword by Rea, who proclaimed: “The artist as an inidual is a responsible part of the society in which he lives and as such cannot escape the issues of his time. The future of art hangs on the future of civilisation.”A shame about the masculine pronouns – and yet the sentiment surely captures the spirit of these radical women.• Radical Women: Jessica Dismorr and Her Contemporaries is at Pallant House Gallery, Chichester, until 23 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73bf74eb0b7502ede6380e16aadb68473507ff5e/0_0_5422_3252/master/5422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e38883b8c530eff3707c601ec716f9f","title":"like looking through butterfly wings ira cohens mylar chamber in pictures","story":"In a New York loft 50 years ago, poet, photographer and film-maker Ira Cohen hung reflective Mylar film on hinged boards, walls and ceiling, and invited visitors – including William Burroughs and Jimi Hendrix – to explore an experimental space"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31b90d8854604435fedb597a9418564e162809aa/0_237_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca0947d85d6c0954c19a2b3fbe50eb26","title":"jenny slate interview little weirds netflix standup","story":"The standup comedian is used to writing for public performance, but her remarkable book Little Weirds was written as private consolationJenny Slate is sitting in the middle of a storm. She’s safe inside, somewhere on a Massachusetts peninsula, and it’s one of those days, she says, when she could happily be drinking a Guinness while the rain lashes down. She is newly engaged, has a book coming out, and “life is lovely”.When life was a little less lovely, the actor and standup comedian embarked on writing Little Weirds, her new collection of ... how to describe them exactly? The assorted pieces aren’t essays, nor short stories perhaps they are best categorised as amused musings on the things that animate her.The book’s catalyst was multi-pronged. She endured “pummelling heartbreak” at the end of a relationship. When Donald Trump became US president in 2016, she felt exhausted, disempowered and “astounding loneliness”. In the introduction she calls the book “a weird party for a woman who has returned from grief”. She started to write the pieces privately as a way of voicing how she felt when Trump’s rhetoric became increasingly disturbing to her. In the face of near-paralysing powerlessness, she was finding her voice. “What I say changes my experience,” she says. “It is important to start on that personal level.”She has a process as a performer, she says, but writing this book involved having no expectations as to how it should be completed. A restless and distracted person, she tried to impose order on herself with early starts but ended up writing most of the book in bed at night, looking at the ocean. She would fall asleep at 4am and wake at 11.Standups turning to prose often struggle with the fact that they can’t hear laughter at the end of their sentences. For Slate – who was a cast member on Saturday Night Live, has performed comedy for more than 15 years, and who has a new Netflix special – standup material doesn’t live until it evokes a reaction. One of the surprises was that despite this, the writing came pouring out of her. “I was so shocked that I was able to express what I wanted to at all,” she says. “It’s like watching someone just throw a bunch of spices into a pot and somehow they know what they’re doing. And I don’t know if that will ever happen again.”Slate is open in conversation, and makes herself even more vulnerable on the page. The book is about her place in the world, the word “I” appearing more frequently than in any other book that I’ve encountered. “I wrote this book to truly soothe and please myself, as if I were the only one who would ever read it.” Writing it, she says at the beginning of the book, she hoped to put herself back together. Gradually, she found, she could. “For me it was wonderful to put myself back together but it was even more important to realise that to be alive is to be in flux.”Even the pieces more obviously grounded in reality (in Trench-TimesDream Dog she writes, “One man was gone from my life just about the time that another man pig-snorted his way into the presidency”) aren’t written with the coruscating honesty that characterises a lot of personal essays her prose is much more poetic than journalistic. She often writes in abstract terms: “I was inclined to throw away my joy,” or, “The only thing left was the number zero.”This isn’t unlike how Slate talks: “I think I have a more lyrical way of speaking than I noticed,” she says. She doesn’t think that she tries to make people laugh in conversation, though she she did when she was younger. Many of the pieces are funny but, for the most part, comedy is not their goal. What is unusual about Little Weirds, however, is that it is a book in which lines such as: “I will gulp clear water that used to have bugs and poop and poison in it but has been cleaned up so that it doesn’t make us blow chunks” can coexist with others such as: “I died after living more of my life with you than I lived with just myself.”It was a conscious decision to fill the book with lyrical language instead of harsh rhetoric. At some point during Trump’s presidency, Slate thought: “For every bit of garbage that this predator is going to spew into the zeitgeist, I’m going to write something beautiful and true about myself or for myself or about my life or for anybody else who wants to listen.” She compares the administration to a bunch of 15-year-olds arguing with each other, and she is frightened not only about the impact that language can have but also “how quickly we can forget to use it in a dignified way”. The opposition to Trump can be waged on numerous fronts, she thinks – one of which is the reclamation of gentle, thoughtful, beautiful expression. “I think we can be discouraged from speaking in tones that are more comforting or are more aesthetically pleasing because we’re being lured into combat all the time,” she says. Slate’s confident and articulate voice belies a personal insecurity. She is a Hollywood movie star who didn’t go to acting school because she thought that if someone commented negatively on her, she wouldn’t have the confidence to keep going. She still suffers from stage fright and though hypnosis has given her coping mechanisms, she thinks it will remain. She likens its effects – forgetting her lines, her throat closing up – to someone tying themselves to a chair so that they cannot physically get on to the stage. “It’s not that I envision the people not laughing,” she says. “It’s that I envision them being angry with me. That’s a very hurtful image to have in my mind. Man, it’s scary.”Where does she think that comes from? “From being bullied at middle school. It comes from the feeling that, as a child, perhaps I was a burden. It comes from the question of whether or not I’m lovable. It comes with me, and I wish that I didn’t have it.”As for how she feels as Little Weirds is about to be received by the wider world, she is sanguine. She neither reads bad reviews nor searches for her name online. She leads a relatively peaceful life, out by the water. And besides, her opinion is the one that matters most to her. “I stand by my work,” she says. “I love it.”• Little Weirds is published on 5 November by Little, Brown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb9a9fb11942c042b9f90f14aed5ef26a0d83421/0_30_3940_2366/master/3940.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29f480f42eed6c2d24f4563a3668ec9d","title":"reading group november the french lieutenants woman john fowles","story":"Published 50 years ago this month, Fowles’ lacerating take on the Victorians is a lot of funThe audacious conceit of The French Lieutenant’s Woman was that it was a novel of 1867 written a century later. Fowles had his Victorian characters act within the constraints of their own time period, but he judged them by the standards of the late 1960s – and made a point of telling us about it.“What are we faced with in the 19th century?” he asked. “An age where woman was sacred and where you could buy a 13-year-old girl for a few pounds – a few shillings if you wanted her for an hour or two. Where more churches were built in the whole previous history in the country and where one in 60 houses in London was a brothel …”All good questions, even another 50 years later in 2019. After all, weren’t Victorians also fond of saying “judge not, that ye be not judged”? I’m curious to see how Fowles measures up now. How will he fare in our own puritanical and hypocritical times? Will we share his concerns, or will we feel as removed from Fowles as he did from the Victorians? There’s certainly the potential for some interesting frisson. And even if it turns out that we get along with Fowles just fine, I’d still be keen to re-engage with him. Like plenty of other writers who turn up on this Reading group, his current reputation seems uncertain. I haven’t read anything negative about him recently, because I haven’t read anything much about him at all. Not so long ago, he was everywhere. Even in 2010, the Times named him as one of the 50 greatest novelists since 1945. Would he make such a list nine years later? Perhaps we’ll have a better idea after revisiting The French Lieutenant’s Woman.It’s also worth saying that it’s not all about judgment. There’s also plenty of fun to be had in this book. One of the things I most clearly remember from when I read The French Lieutenant’s Woman as a teenager is that it has a cracking story, a real emotional heart and a good sense of humour. The book may have a few metafictional fireworks and at least three endings (we’ll look at them later in the month), but Fowles was also very good at the fundamentals. He makes you care and he makes you want to read on. The first sentence is a case in point:An easterly is the most disagreeable wind in Lyme Bay — Lyme Bay being that largest bite from the underside of England’s outstretched southwestern leg — and a person of curiosity could at once have deduced several strong probabilities about the pair who began to walk down the quay at Lyme Regis, the small but ancient eponym of the inbite, one incisively sharp and blustery morning in the late March of 1867.I hope you’ll join me in deducing strong probabilities this month.

Communism’s collapse, he argued, would clear the last obstacle separating the entire world from its destiny of liberal democracy and market economies. Many people agreed.Today, as we face a retreat from the rules-based, liberal global order, with autocratic rulers and demagogues leading countries that contain well over half the world’s population, Fukuyama’s idea seems quaint and naive. But it reinforced the neoliberal economic doctrine that has prevailed for the last 40 years.The credibility of neoliberalism’s faith in unfettered markets as the surest road to shared prosperity is on life-support these days. And well it should be. The simultaneous waning of confidence in neoliberalism and in democracy is no coincidence or mere correlation. Neoliberalism has undermined democracy for 40 years.The form of globalisation prescribed by neoliberalism left iniduals and entire societies unable to control an important part of their own destiny, as Dani Rodrik of Harvard University has explained so clearly, and as I argue in my recent books Globalization and Its Discontents Revisited and People, Power, and Profits. The effects of capital-market liberalisation were particularly odious: if a leading presidential candidate in an emerging market lost favour with Wall Street, the banks would pull their money out of the country. Voters then faced a stark choice: give in to Wall Street or face a severe financial crisis. It was as if Wall Street had more political power than the country’s citizens.Even in rich countries, ordinary citizens were told: “You can’t pursue the policies you want” – whether adequate social protection, decent wages, progressive taxation, or a well-regulated financial system – “because the country will lose competitiveness, jobs will disappear, and you will suffer”.In rich and poor countries alike, elites promised that neoliberal policies would lead to faster economic growth and that the benefits would trickle down so that everyone, including the poorest, would be better off. To get there, though, workers would have to accept lower wages, and all citizens would have to accept cutbacks in important government programmes.The elites claimed that their promises were based on scientific economic models and “evidence-based research”. Well, after 40 years, the numbers are in: growth has slowed and the fruits of that growth went overwhelmingly to a very few at the top. As wages stagnated and the stock market soared, income and wealth flowed up, rather than trickling down.How can wage restraint – to attain or maintain competitiveness – and reduced government programmes possibly add up to higher standards of living? Ordinary citizens felt like they had been sold a bill of goods. They were right to feel conned.We are now experiencing the political consequences of this grand deception: distrust of the elites, of the economic “science” on which neoliberalism was based and of the money-corrupted political system that made it all possible.Nowhere was this intolerance greater than in macroeconomics, where the prevailing models ruled out the possibility of a crisis like the one we experienced in 2008. When the impossible happened, it was treated as if it were a 500-year flood – a freak occurrence that no model could have predicted.Even today, advocates of these theories refuse to accept that their belief in self-regulating markets and their dismissal of externalities as either nonexistent or unimportant led to the deregulation that was pivotal in fuelling the crisis. The theory continues to survive, with Ptolemaic attempts to make it fit the facts, which attests to the reality that bad ideas, once established, often have a slow death.If the 2008 financial crisis failed to make us realise that unfettered markets don’t work, the climate crisis certainly should: neoliberalism will literally bring an end to our civilisation. But it is also clear that demagogues who would have us turn our back on science and tolerance will only make matters worse.The only way forward, the only way to save our planet and our civilisation, is a rebirth of history. We must revitalise the Enlightenment and recommit to honouring its values of freedom, respect for knowledge and democracy.• Joseph E Stiglitz is a Nobel laureate in economics, university professor at Columbia University and chief economist at the Roosevelt Institute."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77066fc47f6e537e04eb0b07e026e3151db8e56a/0_93_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a6c03c38021e223e877199c67efcf6f","title":"uk service sector brexit prices profitability","story":"Rising import prices squeeze firms’ profitability, prompting many to lay off workersServices companies suffered their seventh monthly decline in new orders this year, as Brexit uncertainty continued to take its toll on business and consumer confidence at home and abroad.Export orders were the worst affected last month, falling at the same pace as the near record fall in September, according to IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips).Rising import prices also put a squeeze on firms’ profitability, prompting many to lay off workers, some of them through compulsory redundancies.Activity across the sector was stagnant with the IHS Markit Cips purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rising slightly to 50.0 last month from September’s 49.5. A figure above 50 indicates growth.The modest increase from September reflected reports from some firms of optimism about a resolution to the wrangling over Brexit in the new year following the election.But with the manufacturing and construction sectors in recession, the lack of growth in the services sector meant the economy was suffering its worst period since the 2008 financial crash, said IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson.“The UK PMI surveys collectively indicated a further overall decline in private sector output in October. Contractions have now been recorded in four of the past five months, marking the worst spell since 2009 during the global financial crisis,” he said.The seasonally adjusted IHS MarkitCIPS all-sector output index rose from 48.8 in September to 49.5 in October, signalling a weaker rate of contraction, but the volume of new business fell at a pace similar to that in September, the survey found.“While official data may indicate more robust growth in the third quarter, the PMI warns that some of this could merely reflect a payback from a steeper decline than signalled by the surveys in the second quarter, and that the underlying business trend remains one of stagnation at best,” he added.The trade body said the decline was driven by a big drop in private purchases, suggesting consumers are nervous about making major purchases.The SMMT blamed “a tough environment for businesses and consumers as economic and political uncertainty continued to impact confidence.”“The growth in alternatively fuelled cars is very welcome, showing increasing buyer appetite for these new technologies,” he said.“The overall market remains tough, however, with October now the year’s eighth month of decline and in need of an injection of confidence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f536149f6aece9a9a3bdbc44c7a11814a5dd2b9/0_460_5740_3445/master/5740.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5075e56948237596c7789e7328f1870b","title":"green streets which city has the most trees","story":"Urban trees offer huge benefits for climate regulation and personal wellbeing – and cities from Tampa to Frankfurt are intent on boosting their numbersThe Florida city of Tampa claims a number of firsts: the world’s largest pirate festival America’s longest continuous sidewalk (at 4.5 miles) and Babe Ruth’s longest ever home run (587 feet).Tampa won’t be entering the Guinness Book of Records quite yet however. The Treepedia study is not designed to be comprehensive – it only features 27 cities that MIT researchers selected out of curiosity to see how very different places compare (it has since made its code freely available online so others can calculate their own city’s tree coverage).However, it reflects a growing awareness of the value of urban trees. City-dwellers have always appreciated tree cover, a fact recognised in the premium prices for properties on tree-lined streets and those adjacent to leafy parks. As the world becomes both hotter and increasingly urbanised, the importance of trees for both climate regulation and personal wellbeing is increasingly well-recognised.“We are seeing a surge in attention around urban trees around the world … not just because they are beautiful, but because cities realise that trees are an important part of resiliency, health, wellness, happiness, economic benefit – the list goes on,” says Dan Lambe, president at the charity Arbor Day, whose Tree City USA initiative has more than 3,400 registered communities.Last year, the scheme went global.One of the main motivations behind the MIT ranking was to ascertain how trees help mitigate the so-called heat island effect in cities.Ranking cities by tree coverage remains an imprecise science, however. The Treepedia study looks at the amount of green pereceived while walking along roads and the green spaces people interact with on a daily basis, rather than measuring the total number of trees. It draws on visual data from Google’s Street View service, which registers trees visible from the tech giant’s roving, camera-laden vehicles. Meanwhile, a new, as yet unpublished, study takes a completely different approach to measuring tree canopy and arrives at very different conclusions. However, Simone Borelli, an urban forestry expert at the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), cautions against focusing too much on absolute figures. Access to trees, not their quantity, is what really matters, he argues. Can city-dwellers sense, see or, ideally, touch the trees in their city?Germany excels in this respect, with three in four urban residents living within 300 metres of a leafy green space – and in Frankfurt, the average drops to a remarkable 99 metres.Frankfurt was even named European City of Trees in 2014 in recognition of the care it takes of its trees. It has around 200,000 of them in public spaces, as well as Frankfurt City Forest, which covers around 5,800 hectares in the south of the city and is protected from being used for infrastructure projects or buildings. It is part of the city’s so-called Grüngürtel (“green belt”), situated in the middle of the metropolitan area, consists of woodland, agricultural areas, gardens, parks, sports areas, orchards and nature reserves.Mayor of Frankfurt Peter Feldmann said: “The importance of the Grüngürtel for the people of Frankfurt is such that the city council decided unanimously to protect it from building development back in November 1991. We are very proud of that fact. This provision was made possible because the city of Frankfurt owns two thirds of the total 8000 ha surface of the Grüngürtel.”But what makes tree coverage in the these forested cities higher than in others?Clearly, climatic conditions exert a huge influence. All but two of the Forest Services’ top-10 forested cities, for example, are in locations propitious for tree growth. The exceptions are Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Buenos Aires in Argentina, both of which occupy grassland-like geographies.But putting tree planting and management high on a city’s policy agenda is equally important, argues Dr Leong Chee Chiew, commissioner of parks and recreation, National Parks Board (NParks), in Singapore. “Singapore is today well regarded internationally for our clean and green living environment. This is the result of over five decades of conscientious planning and commitment at greening our city-state, starting from the very early years of our nation-building.”Provision for greenery is built into the city’s development plans so the number of trees and green spaces increase in tandem with urbanisation, he adds. For example, when a road is being planned there’s a requirement for verges to be set aside for tree planting.There are about 7 million trees in Singapore, approximately 3 million of which are along streets, in parks, residential and industrial estates. And NParks has stepped up efforts in recent years by planting more than 50,000 trees a year along roadsides, and in parks and gardens.“This sustained effort in greening has made Singapore a biophilic City in a Garden, with an environment that improves the overall physiological and psychological well-being of all Singaporeans,” says Chee Chiew.Even in densely populated or climatically unfavourable locations, prioritising trees can go a long way. The FAO’s Borelli points to the example of Milan, where the city’s main polytechnic is spearheading a drive to plant 3 million trees between now and 2030 – one for each resident of the city’s metropolitan area.Such en masse planting trees comes at a high price. China is ploughing millions of dollars into its Beautiful China reforestation policy. However, urban trees can be sacrificed to other pressures facing city authorities.The US city of Atlanta (still referred to as a “city in a forest”) was stripped of around 560,000 acres of trees between 1973 and 1999 to make way for houses, roads and retail parks, leading to localised spikes in temperature and smog.Another case in point, environmentalists argue, is the proposed £88bn fast-rail HS2 project in Britain. In September, green campaign groups called on the pending clearance of ancient woodlands to be paused until the results of an independent review are published.“HS2 has already destroyed dozens of ancient London plane trees and priceless green spaces,” the broadcaster and campaign spokesperson Chris Packham said. “It’s an insane act of eco-vandalism.”﻿Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38fd21b8504143c17bc7bdb27607738ebab403cb/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b06081da4447b8cb345a4e1fb35ad6b4","title":"e jean carroll ","story":"The columnist’s defamation case defies the history of a legal system being used to silence womenE Jean Carroll, the Elle advice columnist who in June accused Donald Trump of raping her in a department store dressing room in the mid-90s, filed a lawsuit on Monday in a New York court. She is suing the US president for defamation.After Carroll detailed the rape in an excerpt from her memoir, What Do We Need Men For?, that was published in New York Magazine, Trump did what he usually does: he went after her character. He denied the rape and also made assertions that were easily disproven, including that he had never met Carroll. In fact they had met: her memoir, as well as the magazine excerpt, included a photograph of them together at a party in the 80s. He said she was “totally lying” and thathe would not have raped her, because she wasn’t his type. He invented strange motives for her statement and seemed to implicitly threaten her when he said that there should be grave consequences for her decision to come forward. “Shame on those who make up false stories of assault to try to get publicity for themselves, or sell a book or carry out a political agenda. It’s a disgrace and people should pay dearly for such false accusations.”Those statements disparaging Carroll’s character will now be the subject of a court battle, as the judge determines whether they meet the legal standard for defamation – which, for statements made about public figures like Carroll, means that they would need to be both untrue and made with malice. It is difficult to prove a speaker’s state of mind, but malice seems to be one of the only possible motivators for Trump’s statements about Carroll – why else would he comment on her appearance, for example, saying “she’s not my type”? After the lawsuit was announced on Monday, the White House press secretary said: “I guess since the book didn’t make any money she’s trying to get paid another way. … The lawsuit is frivolous and the story is a fraud, just like the author.” Such a vitriolic statement by one of Trump’s representatives could probably be called defamatory, too.Carroll told friends about the alleged assault at the time, and at least two of them have gone on the record to corroborate her account. But for decades, she didn’t come forward publicly. In her complaint and elsewhere, Carroll says that she considered making her story public during the 2016 election cycle but worried that being credibly accused of rape would make Trump more popular, not less, with a base that expressed sexist contempt for Hillary Clinton and fawning admiration for Trump’s performative crudeness and pantomime of macho virility. She may have been right about that. Carroll also says that she didn’t go to the police when the rape occurred because she was worried that the consequences to her own life would be greater than those for Trump’s. She was probably right about that, too.The legal system has historically not been kind to survivors of sexual violence. Evidence suggests that police do not take sexual assault as seriously as they do other violent crimes. And accusers, now but especially at the time when Carroll says the rape occurred, can be subjected to humiliating interviews, crude speculation about their own sex lives, and character assassinations from defense attorneys. That’s in the criminal justice system. Civil law is often not much better. In fact, when defamation suits arise in the case of sexual assault accusations, it is usually the perpetrator who sues the accuser, saying that she is lying and seeking money from her – not the other way around. (Full disclosure: Carroll and I are represented by the same lawyer, Roberta Kaplan.)Carroll’s suit takes a different approach. Defying a long history of the legal system being used to silence women, Carroll’s lawsuit proceeds from the assumption that women, including women who accuse powerful men of sexual violence, are entitled to all the same legal protections men are. “I am filing this on behalf of every woman who has ever been harassed, assaulted, silenced, or spoken up only to be shamed, fired, ridiculed and belittled,” Carroll said in a statement. “It’s for every woman who can’t speak up because she’ll lose the job she needs to support her three kids.” The forms of retaliation that Carroll faced when she came forward with her allegation – being mocked, dismissed, smeared, ignored, threatened, and professionally sidelined – aren’t uncommon. They happen to every woman who comes forward about her sexual abuse. But just because these kinds of retaliation are normal doesn’t mean that they’re acceptable – and it doesn’t mean that they’re legal, either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdc685fad277b5092f47dad6f1049985fb77c762/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2a794211a9f6d905774bdf23d481713","title":"food bank britain trussell trust report election","story":"Depending on who you listen to, the stakes of this election couldn’t be more different. Believe the panic of the super-rich reportedly preparing to flee the UK if Jeremy Corbyn becomes prime minister, and the vote is a threat to billionaires’ “quality of life”. Read the groundbreaking report from the Trussell Trust released today and it could come down to something altogether more elemental: whether families can afford to eat.The explosion of food banks over the past decade is about more than just hunger – it’s about what sort of society Britain has become. It’s one where 14 million people are living in poverty and workers can earn wages while still facing homelessness. It’s one where more than half of children are growing up below the breadline in some neighbourhoods, and teachers find pupils sleeping rough behind bins. Mass destitution has flourished under a sticking-plaster welfare state. At the start of this decade, the Trussell Trust ran just 57 food banks. Now it’s 424.The thing about the normalisation of hardship is that it’s only a matter of time before something that once horrified a nation is allowed to get worse. Years after food banks went from a temporary blip to a staple of most towns and cities, it’s now standard practice for some to give out “cold boxes”: tinned groceries that can be eaten without the need for hot water or heating. Volunteers noticed some people would collect a box of pasta and rice only to admit it was useless to them – once they got home, they wouldn’t be able to afford to switch on their cooker or kettle. Other food banks tell me they are now doing a “delivery service” to disabled people who are starving but too ill to leave the house to get an emergency food parcel.If this seems obscene, it’s because it is obscene. But what should be our greatest concern is that in one of the richest nations on earth, such horror is now an accepted part of life. One of the most pervasive myths in modern society has long been that gross inequality is natural – that the best and brightest can quite rightly become billionaires while others, typically due to their own failings, will always go hungry. The Trussell Trust research is a skewer to this fallacy. It shows the biggest driver of food bank use is a benefits system that has undergone such disastrous “reforms” in recent years, from cuts to the value of social security payments and delays in universal credit to people being rejected for disability benefits. Forget families too idle to “manage their finances”, this is a wheelchair user wrongly found “fit for work” or a care worker in crisis because she’s just been evicted.For all the complexities of poverty, the conversation around food banks is quite simple. More and more people are reliant on these services because all avenues of a dignified and secure way to feed themselves have been cut off – whether that’s a competent benefits system, affordable housing or an economy where workers can earn a wage they’re able to live on. These are not unfathomable problems beyond our grasp but ones that have clear enough causes and solutions. There is hope in this, if we wish to find it. Just as hardship has been created by ministers who have been willing to toss large swathes of the public aside, it can be lifted by a political class that decides they matter.As the UK heads into a make-or-break election, rightwing pundits are predictably already out in force with the cliches – spending pledges are too expensive, fair taxes would be disruptive to the wealthy, the safety net is working. But the more they feel the need to defend how things are, the more tangible real change feels. The greatest trick a government can play is convincing the electorate that their suffering is inevitable. It should be the unwritten slogan of the election: Food Bank Britain is not the best we can do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f36b8341cc0c484197eb663efd7f474e16970e17/157_0_2843_1706/master/2843.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b3b4eed4e5d4fc0c6e356da6c8c2010","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of silence","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘silence’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘silence’.Share your photos of what silence means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 6 November at 10am.

Photographs by David J Phillip and David GoldmanAPEverton Simpson squints at the Caribbean from his motorboat, scanning the dazzling bands of colour for hints of what lies beneath. Emerald green indicates sandy bottoms. Sapphire blue lies above seagrass meadows. And deep indigo marks coral reefs. That is where he is heading. He steers the boat to an unmarked spot he knows as the “coral nursery”. Simpson started working as a “coral gardener” two years ago as part of grassroots efforts to bring Jamaica’s coral reefs back from the brink.On the ocean floor, small coral fragments dangle from suspended ropes. Simpson and other ers tend to this underwater nursery as gardeners look after a flower bed, painstakingly plucking off snails and fireworms that feast on immature coral. When each stub grows to about the size of a human hand, Simpson collects them in his crate to inidually transplant on to a reef. Even fast-growing coral species add just a few inches a year.A few hours later, at a site called Dickie’s Reef, Simpson es again and uses bits of fishing line to tie clusters of staghorn coral on to rocky outcroppings, a temporary binding until the coral’s limestone skeleton grows and fixes itself on to the rock. The goal is to jumpstart the natural growth of a coral reef. And, so far, it is working.With fish and coral, it is a co-dependent relationship. The fish rely on the reef structure to evade danger and lay eggs, and also eat up the coral’s rivals. When too many fish disappear, the coral suffers, and vice versa.The delicate labour of the coral gardener is only one part of restoring a reef and for all its intricacy it is actually the most straightforward part. Convincing lifelong fishermen to curtail when and where they fish and controlling the surging waste dumped into the ocean are trickier endeavours.Slowly, the comeback effort is gaining momentum. “The coral are coming back, the fish are coming back,” says Stuart Sandin, a marine biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. “It’s probably some of the most vibrant coral reefs we’ve seen in Jamaica since the 1970s. When you give nature a chance, she can repair herself. It’s not too late.”Sandin is studying the health of coral reefs around the world as part of a research project called the 100 Island Challenge. His starting assumption was that the most populated islands would have the most degraded habitats, but what he found instead was that humans can be either a blessing or a curse, depending on how they manage resources.In Jamaica, more than a dozen grassroots-run coral nurseries and fish sanctuaries have sprung up in the past decade, supported by small grants from foundations, local businesses such as hotels and scuba clinics, and the Jamaican government.At White River, which is only about two years old and where Simpson works, the clearest proof of early success is the return of tropical fish that inhabit the reefs, as well as hungry pelicans, skimming the surface of the water to feed on them.Jamaica’s coral reefs were once among the world’s most celebrated, with their golden branching structures and resident brightly coloured fish drawing the attention of travellers from Christopher Columbus to Ian Fleming, who wrote most of his James Bond novels on the island’s northern coast in the 1950s and 1960s.In 1965, the country became the site of the first global research hub for coral reefs, the Discovery Bay Marine Lab, now associated with the University of the West Indies. The groundbreaking marine biologist couple Thomas and Nora Goreau completed fundamental research here, including describing the symbiotic relationship between coral and algae and pioneering the use of scuba equipment for marine studies. The same lab also provided a vantage point as the coral disappeared.Peter Gayle has been a marine biologist at Discovery Bay since 1985. From the yard outside his office, he points towards the reef crest about 300 metres (985ft) away, a thin brown line splashed with white waves. “Before 1980, Jamaica had healthy coral,” he says. Then several disasters struck.The first calamity was 1980’s Hurricane Allen, one of the most powerful cyclones in recorded history. “Its 40ft waves crashed against the shore and basically chewed up the reef,” Gayle says. Coral can grow back after natural disasters but only when given a chance to recover, which it never got.“There was a tipping point in the 1980s, when it switched from being a coral-dominated system to being an algae-dominated system,” Gayle says. “Scientists call it a ‘phase shift’.”That seemed like the end of the story until an unlikely alliance started to tip the ecosystem back in the other direction, with help from residents such as Simpson and his fellow fisherman Lipton Bailey.The fishing community of White River revolves around a small boat-docking area about a quarter of a mile from where the river flows into the Caribbean Sea. One early morning, as purple dawn light filters into the sky, Simpson and Bailey step on to a 28ft motorboat called the Interceptor.Both men have lived and fished their whole lives in the community. Recently, they have come to believe that they need to protect the coral reefs that attract tropical fish, while setting limits on fishing to ensure the sea is not emptied too quickly.In the White River area, the solution was to create a protected area, a “fish sanctuary”, for immature fish to grow and reach reproductive age before they are caught.Two years ago, the fishermen joined with local businesses, including hotel owners, to form a marine association and negotiate the boundaries for a no-fishing zone stretching two miles along the coast. A simple line in the water is hardly a deterrent however, to make the boundary meaningful, it must be enforced. Today, the local fishermen, including Simpson and Bailey, take turns patrolling the boundary in the Interceptor.On this morning, the men steer the boat just outside a row of orange buoys marked “no fishing”. ‘‘We are looking for violators,” Bailey says, his eyes trained on the rocky coast. “Sometimes you find spearmen. They think they’re smart. We try to beat them at their game.”Most of the older and more established fishermen, who own boats and set out lines and wire cages, have come to accept the no-fishing zone. Besides, the risk of having their equipment confiscated is too great. But not everyone is on board. Some younger men hunt with lightweight spearguns, swimming out to sea and firing at close-range. These men, some of them poor and with few options, are the most likely trespassers.The patrols carry no weapons, so they must master the art of persuasion. “Let them understand this. It’s not a ‘you’ thing or a ‘me’ thing. This isn’t personal,” Bailey says of past encounters with violators.These are sometimes risky efforts. Two years ago, Jerlene Layne, a manager at nearby Boscobel fish sanctuary, ended up in hospital with a bruised leg after being attacked by a man she had reprimanded for fishing illegally. “He used a stick to hit my leg because I was doing my job, telling him he cannot fish in the protected area,” she says.Layne believes her work would be safer with more formal support from the police, but she is not going to stop. “Public mindsets can change,” she says. “If I back down on this, what kind of message does that send? You have to stand for something.”She has pressed charges in court against repeat trespassers, typically resulting in a fine and the confiscation of equipment.One such violator is Damian Brown, 33, who lives in a coastal neighbourhood called Stewart Town. Sitting outside on a concrete staircase near his modest home, Brown says fishing is his only option for work and he believes the sanctuary boundaries extend too far.Back at the White River docking area, Rick Walker, a 35-year-old spear fisherman, is cleaning his motorboat. He remembers the early opposition to the fish sanctuary, when many people said they were trying to stop their livelihood.Two years later, Walker, who is not involved in running the sanctuary but supports its boundary, says he can see the benefits. “It’s easier to catch snapper and barracuda,” he says. “At least my great-grandkids will get to see some fish.”When Columbus landed in Jamaica he sailed into Oracabessa Bay, which is today a 20-minute drive from the mouth of the White River. Oracabessa Bay fish sanctuary was the first of the grassroots-led efforts to revive Jamaica’s coral reefs. Its sanctuary was legally incorporated in 2010 and its approach of enlisting local fishermen as patrols became a model for other regions.“The fishermen are mostly on board and happy, that’s the distinction. That’s why it’s working,” says the sanctuary manager, Inilek Wilmot.David Murray, the head of the Oracabessa Fishers’ Association, notes that Jamaica‘s 60,000 fishermen operate without a safety net. “Fishing is like gambling, it’s a game. Sometimes you catch something, sometimes you don’t,” he says. When fish populations began to collapse two decades ago, something had to change.Murray now works as a warden in the Oracabessa sanctuary, while continuing to fish outside its boundary. He also spends time explaining the concept to neighbours.“It’s people work, it’s a process to get people to agree on a sanctuary boundary,” he says. “It’s a tough job to tell a man who’s been fishing all his life that he can’t fish here.”But once it became clear that a no-fishing zone actually helped nearby fish populations rebound, it became easier to build support. The number of fish in the sanctuary has doubled between 2011 and 2017, and the inidual fish have grown larger, nearly tripling in length on average, according to annual surveys by Jamaica’s national environment and planning agency. And that boosts catches in surrounding areas. After word got out about Oracabessa, other regions wanted advice.“We have the data to show success but even more important than data is word of mouth,” says Wilmot, who oversaw training to help start the fish sanctuary at White River.Morrow, a lifelong water sports enthusiast often seen paddle-boarding with her dog, Shadow, runs the White River Marine Association. She attends fishers’ meetings and raises small grants from the Jamaican government and other foundations to support equipment purchases and coral replanting campaigns.“We all depend on the ocean,” Morrow says, sitting in a small office decorated with nautical maps in the 70-year-old Jamaica Inn. “If we don’t have a good healthy reef and a good healthy marine environment, we will lose too much. Too much of the country relies on the sea.”This Associated Press feature was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s department of science education.

This system is regarded as an improvement on its predecessor, which encouraged over-supply in some areas by awarding production-based subsidies, leading to the infamous butter mountains and wine lakes of previous decades.However, the current CAP – which costs EU taxpayers €60bn a year – is “turning rural areas into green deserts of uninhabitable maximum-yield monocultures”, according to the European Ornithologists Union, the European Mammal Foundation, the Societas Europaea Herpetologica, the Societas Europaea Lepidopterologica and Butterfly Conservation Europe.There is now an “unequivocal scientific consensus” that the plummeting numbers of European farmland birds, populations of which more than halved between 1980 and 2015, and a decline of more than three-quarters among insects in some areas, have happened because of intensified farming, the signatories wrote.“The greening measures in the CAP are largely ineffective at retaining or restoring bioersity and are too often poorly controlled,” they wrote. “The current agri-environmental schemes are both underfunded and insufficiently targeted to meet the scale of the damage to farmland bioersity.”Proposed changes that would place more emphasis on such measures are still inadequate, the experts found. Instead, they want to see fundamental reforms that support smaller farms that use sustainable methods and maintain high bioersity.Harriet Bradley, the EU agriculture policy officer at BirdLife Europe, said: “The scientific evidence speaks for itself – intensive farming is killing nature. If the CAP isn’t fundamentally reformed – if we don’t make space for nature – then Europe’s ‘Green Deal’ promises on bioersity and climate will just be empty words on another piece of paper.”In the UK, farmers will no longer receive CAP subsidies of about £3bn a year after Brexit, but the government has pledged instead to offer payments to farmers who meet certain environmental targets, which have not yet been set out.A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Leaving the EU presents an opportunity to design a bespoke agricultural policy and reward our farmers for enhancing the environment, including protecting and improving bioersity.“Our new environmental land management scheme is intended to be a powerful vehicle for driving this change and achieving the goals of the 25-year environment plan. We are now working closely with a range of environmental and agricultural stakeholders to collaboratively design this new scheme.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c360b6db88dd12f0f8eafa47bba9c28f98bf0c38/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=393fa324178e44eddef16bb0d0466dbf","title":"the guardians climate pledge 2019","story":"We want the  to play a leading role in reporting on the environmental catastrophe.

The solution was simple: forget the three films that came after (something most people had already done) and create a retcon reunion, following on directly from the still-adored second chapter. It’s a strategy that hauled Michael Myers back to life, and profit, last year with the shock success of the gory palette-cleanser Halloween, making $255m worldwide and becoming the biggest slasher film of all time.Bringing back Arnold Schwarzenegger was less of a get, given that he had stuck around for 2003’s Rise of the Machines and 2015’s Genisys, but reuniting him with Linda Hamilton was a more sellable sell and the film itself played out like a Force Awakens-style retread, regurgitating a similar formula with plenty of sly winks aimed at long-time fans. It also provided a major return for James Cameron, shapeshifting from director to producer, giving his stamp of approval, one that was bombastically bragged about in the film’s pricey marketing campaign.Reviews were decent but early tracking suggested that audience interest was minimal and early pre-apocalyptic panic started to set in. The film’s budget has been reported as $185m, a staggering amount given the franchise’s spotty history, and while experts had forecast a weekend of between $30-40m, Dark Fate sputtered out at just $29m in the US. To put that into perspective alongside other action sequels this year, that’s less than the openings of John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum ($56m), Godzilla: King of the Monsters ($47m), Dark Phoenix ($32m) and even Men in Black: International ($30m). Within the Terminator franchise, it’s far beneath the openings of Rise of the Machines ($44m) and Salvation ($42m) but slightly up on Genisys ($27m). But what does all this really mean?Since Rise of the Machines performed adequately in 2003, making $433m globally from a $200m budget, there have now been three attempts to reframe the franchise. In 2009, McG’s post-apocalyptic sequel Salvation leaped forward in time, removed all familiar cast members, added Christian Bale and Sam Worthington and changed the R-rated franchise to a PG-13 one. Cameron, who wasn’t involved, later said that he “didn’t hate it as much” as he thought he would, which was ultimately one of the nicest things one could say about the film which was loathed by critics and despite the more audience-friendly rating, it was the first Terminator film not to open at number one in the US. International audiences were slightly more forgiving with the film reaching $371m worldwide and producers learning an important lesson about where the film’s future could lie.Six years later and after rights were sold to Annapurna who then turned to Paramount for financial assistance, the franchise was being rebooted with the confusingly timelined, and titled, Genisys. Arnie was back as the T-800, as was Sarah Connor, this time played by Emilia Clarke, but the film imagined a different version of events, taking the pieces of the original, throwing them up in the air and restarting the story with a new bent. But somehow reviews were even worse than Salvation and while Cameron initially claimed to be a fan, he later said he’d voiced support purely out of loyalty to Arnie. Domestically, the film was a washout, making just $89m but internationally, it crept up to a solid $440m, helped massively by a $113m haul in China. Planned as the first film in a new trilogy, critical apathy and underwhelming returns led to another reshape. This time Cameron was re-enlisted along with Deadpool director Tim Miller, which brings us back to 2019, where we’re left to pick up the pieces of yet another terminated Terminator timeline.The disappointing domestic opening for Dark Fate is worth couching. For one, it’s still $2m higher than that of Genisys and the stronger reviews would imply that word of mouth could propel it to a higher final tally. But Dark Fate’s budget is at least $30m more and, this is the killer, it’s also performing under expectations internationally with audiences in China, France and the UK proving to be particularly unengaged. So far, with some markets opening a week before the US, the film has only just crossed $123m and will reportedly need to make $480m just to break even. Industry experts are currently estimating losses of between $110-130m for the film’s backers Paramount, Skydance and FoxDisney, who released it internationally.So what went wrong?While reviews were better than any Terminator film since Judgment Day (faint praise at best), they were still littered with reservations. It was seen by many as a lazy retread, giving audiences more of the same rather than adding anything particularly fresh to the franchise. The script is a product of a rather torturous-sounding process involving six writers and the final film is a product of a battle for supremacy between Miller and Cameron. “The blood is still being scrubbed off the walls from those creative battles,” Cameron has said of the production. “This is a film that was forged in fire … Tim wanted to make it his movie. And I’m like, ‘Yeah, but I kind of know a little about this world.’” It’s inevitable that the end-product bears its share of bruises as a result and the struggle between the old and the new is felt throughout.Some of the early negative buzz was focused on a fanboy-baiting twist that saw John Connor dispatched in the first scene (an idea that Cameron is taking ownership of) and the film’s shift towards the women that would be in charge of preventing a robot apocalypse instead. Many found this to be one of the film’s fresher angles, and performances from Hamilton and franchise newcomer Mackenzie Davis were rightfully praised, but some misogynist trolls took against the film from the outset, especially after the first image of three female characters together was released. Back in July, Miller claimed the film would “scare the fuck” out of sexist naysayers. “You can see online the responses to some of the early shit that’s out there … I don’t give a fuck,” he said. It’s foggy as to whether this backlash did end up impacting the box office but it’s yet another, admittedly depressingly dim-witted, problem that the film had to weather.While a similar sequel-forgetting strategy worked last year for Halloween, the 2018 iteration was blessed with a lower budget, an easy-to-convey concept and, most notably, a series of mostly atrocious sequels that had come and gone without much awareness from the average cinemagoer. The last entry had been 2002’s Halloween: Resurrection, forgotten by all who had had the misfortune of seeing it, while the failed Terminator restarts had been more recent and sold on a much larger scale. “The goodwill and brand equity created by the first two Terminator films was arguably undone by the subsequent pre-Dark Fate installments, which may have negatively impacted audience interest in this latest chapter in the series,” said Comscore’s Paul Dergarabedian to the Hollywood Reporter. Die-hard franchise fans were probably both weary and wary of another while others were likely confused by where this new film stood and whether one would need to catch up on the films in-between before shelling out to go see it. It’s also yet another 80s action franchise that’s not managed to attract a new generation to the plate. Last year, saw The Predator crash land, this year saw Rambo: Last Blood killed and the disappointing performance of Alien: Covenant has left that franchise in a cryogenic sleep. Arnie’s much-hyped, post-Governor Hollywood comeback has also been commercially unimpressive, from The Last Stand to Sabotage, making his appeal, even when attached to his most famous role, highly questionable.Again, this was envisioned as the first part of a new trilogy but according to sources, post-box office wreckage, there are no plans for a follow-up. I’d argue that there is a way of making another Terminator film that could work, both critically and commercially, but the strategy would need to be smaller in scale. When audiences grew tired of Wolverine’s standalone adventures, Fox made the nifty decision to narrow the focus, as well as the budget, and gave a green light to the R-rated Logan, a violent, character-led drama that was easily accessible to those who’d long given up on the films that came before it. Logan was a shock hit, grossing over $600m worldwide, the second highest-grossing X-Men movie to date, picking up superheroic reviews on the way. Its success was probably a leading factor in the development of the similarly back-to-basics Joker, a $900m hit that’s just become the biggest R-rated film of all time. There’s a version of this model that could be transplanted to the Terminator universe too, something that was tried on a broader, and more expensive, scale, in Dark Fate’s treatment of Arnie’s T-800, but one that could be extracted and expanded upon in a gritty, and cheaper, separate story.It’s perhaps more merciful to let this one lie though, to rest the Terminators alongside the corpses of the Men in Black, the Blair Witch and the Predators, to accept that nostalgia in this instance is more potent when it’s left untarnished. If a figure from the future were to arrive in 2019 with a message, it would probably be a desperate plea to stop making any more of these damn movies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b62807c76b1437151f8ea0353e88b9340c8301b4/35_1091_982_589/master/982.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=d95b68c05739de6784d5349d8f30b704","title":"boats burgers and whale bones cambridge for kids","story":"From playgrounds to punts, mazes to museums, animals to afternoon tea, Cambridge is packed with kid-happy things to see, do and eat. Get insider’s advice from local Oisín Higney, seven (with the help of brother Milo, 17, and mum Kate) Cambridge is brilliant and my Granny Eva lives there too. It has a river and loads of museums and parks. It is fun to travel there by train. I’d like to be a train driver when I grow up, or maybe a pilot. Last time, we shared our seats with another family and I got to watch Paw Patrol on another boy’s iPad. So I made a new friend, which was awesome. Do you want to know what I like to do in Cambridge?Cambridge University Botanic Garden is very near the station and is great to run around. It has a fountain, a mini-maze and stepping stones over a little lake. I think that the tall yellow grass plants look like fur. I like to hide behind the trees. You can’t climb them as it might hurt the branches. I like to make up games in the rock garden instead. The greenhouse is not green but it is hot and made of glass. Go to see the big cactuses and pretend you are a cowboy. They have very prickly spines so watch out. Also, there is a lily pad big enough for a frog the size of me.From here you can walk into town by following the river. You go over lots of bridges. If you want you can play in the Lammas Land playground. In summer, there are brown cows in Coe Fen and Midsummer Common. Real cows, you say, in the middle of Cambridge? Yes there are, and it’s kind of cool.At the Mill Pond, by the Mathematical Bridge, there are lots of people on small boats called punts. An adult has to stand up with a long pole. It looks like they are fishing but really they are pushing the boats along. We went on a punt and ate strawberries. The man who pushed us was really good at ducking down under the bridges and not falling off. You can even go at night on a Bat Punt Safari. Spooky!Do you like skateparks, tennis or playgrounds? Jesus Green has them all, right next to the river. Sometimes we go to the family runs on Sunday morning in Milton Country Park. I can run really fast. The Science Centre has a cool marble run, and the Centre for Computing History has a lot of retro games that my dad knows all about.There are lots of buildings that look like castles in the middle of Cambridge. King’s College looks like a church castle and Trinity College is where a man called Newton went. He had an apple fall on his head, and then he invented gravity, which is very cool. Did you know that there is a banana tree in Cambridge? It’s in Pembroke College. See if you can find the big Corpus Clock made of real gold. I think it is funny as it doesn’t even tell the time. It has a mechanical insect on the top, and if you wait for ages, his eye blinks. If you like climbing high you can see the whole of Cambridge from Great St Mary’s Church Steeple. Just don’t get stuck next to the bell when it rings! It can be fun to to explore the small streets in the centre, you could even do a treasure trail. If I get tired of walking, we go into Heffers, Waterstones or the Central Library and look at children’s books.Did I say that there were loads of museums? Just on Downing Street there are three, like the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences. Find the bronze statue of Mr Sedgwick. He is holding a hammer and a trilobite shell that is 500m years old, which is older than my mum. My favourite is the huge fin whale at the Museum of Zoology. It hangs on the ceiling and it’s ginormous. You can look up and see all its bones and teeth. I also like the stuffed animals, games, and big screen with tiny square TVs of different creatures. My brother says we have to look after animals or they just get extinct. There is a museum that also looks like a castle. It is the Fitzwilliam and when you get in the ceiling is really high. You have got to see the Egyptian mummies, the knight’s armour and the swords – they are awesome. If you like real animals, then the red pandas in Shepreth Wildlife Park are really cute. It is right next to Shepreth train station, just a few minutes outside Cambridge.Aromi has tasty Sicilian margherita pizza that you eat from a wooden plate. I love the dark chocolate ice-cream. My brother likes Bill’s restaurant, as he says it has delicious buttermilk pancakes with bacon and the staff are really friendly. They are only served at brunch so you must be early. He also likes the spicy chicken rolls in Pho (Vietnamese). La Margherita has nice pasta, and is near Kettles Yard Art Gallery. The MillWorks has a real gigantic wheel in the middle and is right next to the river. My favourite is a plain burger and fries at Byron Burger or Honest Burger, but it has to have ketchup. If you want some treats for the train home, there are Chelsea buns in Fitzbillies. On Mill Road, near the station, you can get nice cakes in the Urban Larder or Norfolk Street Bakery. And if you want an apple to fall on your head and have a big idea, you can go to the Orchard Tea Garden in Grantchester for strawberry jam scones and sit under the trees in a deckchair.Take a trip to Cambridge.

So if you want the inside scoop on family fun? Talk to an under-10, of course. Six-year-old Londoner Indy Williams – with help from mum Kate Faithfull-Williams – shares her favourite city spotsI love London because it’s an exciting place to live and it has lots of landmarks. London can get very busy because lots of people want to come here. You might not know this but it’s great being a little kid in a big city because there’s lots to do and it’s easy to get about. It’s fastest to go on the train because then you don’t get stuck in traffic. I like to do crossword puzzles waiting at the station and to wave at the driver. All aboard? Off we go …Start right in the middle of London – literally, because Blackfriars station is on the river. It’s right next to a big art museum called Tate Modern. There are cool exhibitions with light-up kaleidoscopes and swings. Outside, look for the performers by the river who blow massive bubbles so big you can jump inside. Watch out for the statues. They are not real statues, but people dressed up in gold.Walk past Shakespeare’s Globe theatre and on to Borough Market where you can eat any sort of food you fancy. Maybe sausages or a big lunch like paella and the most ginormous fudgy chocolate brownie. Look out for the new Thames virtual reality experience by One London Bridge. It’s like a big pair of goggles that lets you see all the wildlife in the Thames, like seahorses, seals and even dolphins and sharks.You have to go to Tower Bridge because at the top there’s a glass walkway. It looks like you’re standing on air. Me and my mum and little sister lay down on the glass and it was super duper scary but really exciting. It feels like you’re flying above the buses and boats below. The road rises up to let tall ships in and out of London. From the top you can see an old warship called HMS Belfast, the jungle at the Sky Garden, lots of skyscrapers like the Shard, and the Tower of London.The Tower of London is a real palace where the Crown Jewels live. They look delicious, but they’re rocks not sweets and you’re not allowed to lick them. The crown has a sparkly disco ball on top, which is cool. You can go on a tour and meet the ravens and look at the king’s armour. It’s silly there isn’t any armour for queens. Why isn’t there any? If I was the Queen I’d want my own armour.The train takes you right past the Shard and St Paul’s Cathedral to Greenwich. Climb aboard the big ship from long, long ago called the Cutty Sark. You can run up and down on the deck but you’re not allowed to jump off the railings. You’re not allowed to jump on the little bunk beds either, but it’s fun to play in the captain’s cabin. The ship isn’t in the water. It’s in a big hall with a cafe where you can get a kids’ lunchbox or a fancy afternoon tea with lots of little cakes.Don’t bother with the meridian line. It’s not time travel like I thought it would be. It’s just a line with lots of people queuing up to take boring photos. But you might like the space exhibition at the planetarium in the Royal Observatory. You can fly to the sun or land on Mars and see what a star looks like when it is born.The National Maritime Museum is my favourite because it’s got a big kids’ zone. You can climb the rigging, fix old boats, dress up like a pirate, catch pretend lobsters and sell them in the crab shop. Upstairs by the cafe there’s a giant map you can run all over. You can stand on your country and run across the ocean. Russia is very big. England is teeny weeny. In the grownup part of the museum there is Lord Nelson’s jacket with a bullet hole in the shoulder, paintings by Turner, who I’m learning about in school, and figureheads from old boats, which I used to be scared of. My mum got me a little baby turtle (not a real one) in the gift shop. She’s called Turtle.On Sunday morning come to Junior Parkrun in Wimbledon Park. It’s free but you have to register. I run 2km with my friends Josie, Alex and Emily. Sometimes I walk. After Parkrun you can get peanut butter ice-cream or strawberry sorbet in the park cafe. Sometimes the sprinklers are on if you want to cool down. Wimbledon Park has everything: a big lake where kids can sail their own boats, an obstacle course, two playgrounds (for babies and older children), mini golf and beach volleyball. I prefer playing sports to watching them so I haven’t been to the famous tennis court in Wimbledon but my nana and grampy have been to the museum there and they ate a lot of strawberries. They didn’t bring any home for me.The best lunch is in Wimbledon Village, which looks like the country but it is in London. Everybody will like a margherita at the pizza van. They do spicy pizzas for grownups too. The orange juice at Megan’s on the High Street is the most delicious drink I’ve ever had.Before you get on the train home, walk up to Wimbledon Common where you can make dens out of big sticks and leaves. It is a good idea to wear wellies. There’s lots of colourful flowers and wildlife, like birds and squirrels and dogs. Once I saw a beautiful brown horse.All aboardUp to four kids per adult can travel with Thameslink on most journeys for as little as £2 on Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets (T\u0026ampCs apply).

Say hello to Worthing: the lesser-known beachside beauty with bucket-and-spades-full of family fun. Lola Davies, aged 13 (with a little help from mum Tracey), gives us the inside scoop on family time in her favourite seaside spot by Lola and Tracey DaviesI’m going to call this guide “The Importance of Being Worthing”, because my English teacher says that Oscar Wilde spent a summer here in 1894 – and wrote The Importance of Being Earnest in Worthing.Only a 25-minute train ride from where I live in Brighton, Worthing’s where we come when Brighton gets a bit too busy. It’s a traditional Georgian seaside resort, with an art deco pier (which won Pier of the Year 2019), old-fashioned amusements and ice-cream parlours, a new big wheel and a lovely, long pebbly beach.When the sun shines ...It’s easy for us to get to Worthing from Brighton, but Londoners can get there easily too – the direct train from London Victoria only takes 90 minutes. This year, the Worthing Observation Wheel opened. At 46 metres high, it’s the tallest observation wheel on the south coast, and is open from April to October. While you can’t quite see my house from the top, it has amazing views all along the coast and across the South Downs national park.If you don’t fancy swimming in the sea then go to Splashpoint, a fun leisure centre with slides and a ing pool that is close to the beach.For smaller kids, say eight and under, I recommend The Worthing Lido, a small amusement park with rides like the spinning teacups and the Disney Express train. My brother, sister and I always like playing on the 2p slot machines in the arcade.Is Worthing worth it on a rainy day?We don’t just come to Worthing when it’s sunny. Sometimes I like it more when it’s not, as it means we can go to the Dome Cinema on the seafront. It was called The Kursaal when it opened in 1911 and had a rollerskating rink on the ground floor and a cinema on the top floor. It’s a shame it doesn’t have the rollerskating rink any more, but I like watching films in the old-fashioned auditorium with vintage seats. My mum says it was in the movie Wish You Were Here, which was filmed in Worthing, and there’s lots of old cinema memorabilia in the Projectionist’s Bar.On the way down to the beach, we pass Harold Pinter’s old house, and pop in to the Worthing Museum and Art Gallery. It’s free to enter and has loads of cool stuff, like piles of Roman coins and tools found nearby at Cissbury Ring, an iron age fort. I like the 19th- and 20th-century clothes they have on display – Mum always swoons over the sparkly Chanel dress from the 1930s. But my favourite bit is the cabinet of swimming costumes throughout the years. I think it’s crazy that people back then used to wear knitted bathers!Getting hungry?While I’m happy with candy floss and ice-cream, the folks insist on having something more substantial when we visit Worthing. The Beach House on the seafront is one of my favourite places. Located between the pier and the Dome, it has a sunny terrace overlooking the beach and serves posh burgers, lots of vegan and vegetarian things (for my veggie sister) and local craft beer for thirsty parents.If we don’t want to leave the beach, Mum will order a takeaway from Pizzaface, a cool Brighton pizza shop that has just opened in Worthing. They also like CrabShack, another little restaurant by the sea that serves fresh crab and zingy cockle popcorn. But for a special meal try Pitch on Warwick Street, which is run by local chef Kenny Tutt, the winner of MasterChef 2018.Old-fashioned seaside treatsWhen I was younger, I loved riding a quadracycle, one of those big four-wheeled bikes with a stripy roof, along the seafront. But now I’m 13, it’s become a bit embarrassing to ride one with your parents!One thing I’ll never grow out of, though, is a knickerbocker glory from Macari’s, a cafe and ice-cream parlour on the seafront that’s retro inside. Apparently it’s been open for nearly 60 years, and has always been run by the same family. Mum says the knickerbocker glory still tastes the same as when she was a kid.It’s about a 15-minute walk from Macari’s back to the train station, just in time to catch one of the regular trains back home to Brighton.All aboardUp to four kids per adult can travel on most journeys for as little as £2 on Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets with Southern (T\u0026ampCs apply).

But does it help men find their dream mate - or just encourage street harassment?In an upmarket bar near Oxford Circus in London, I am watching two men hit on women with all the desperation of a doomed cavalry charge. But without the heroism.Mike and Raj (not their real names) circle the bar, scanning for women, drinks held at an awkward right angle to their chests. When they identify a target, they approach. The women stiffen, their smiles tightening. They swirl drinks with straws and chit-chat politely before mentioning boyfriends – real or imagined. The men retreat, regroup, identify fresh women. Advance, engage, retreat. On and on it goes.I’m standing with the man coordinating this operation, the British pickup artist Johnny Cassell, as he watches as Mike and Raj – his students – run drills. Tonight is the culmination of Cassell’s intensive, day-long “Impactful Connection” workshop. For £700, Cassell promises to help men “master the art of attracting the women you truly want”. But watching as Mike and Raj hit on women indiscriminately,  it looks as if any women will do.It has been a long and disturbing day. Arriving at the venue, a four-star Mayfair hotel that morning, I had found Cassell, 31, in a black mood: a client had just dropped out. Tall and handsome, with a wolfish air, Cassell switches between being charming and cold. He does not like being contradicted or mocked. At one point during the session, I joke about spreadsheets and GDPR violations. Cassell is visibly displeased.For the uninitiated, pickup artists (PUAs) are typically men – female artists are much rarer – who attempt to coax women into having sex with them through a mixture of flattery, psychological manipulation and coercion. The movement has a surprisingly long pedigree, dating back to Eric Weber’s now almost 50-year-old manual How to Pick Up Girls. Today, this seems relatively sedate stuff. Weber writes, “the most important tenet of a pick up is that it’s mutual … Women are entitled to say ‘no’, plain and simple.” But the community really exploded into the public consciousness with the publication of Neil Strauss’s 2005 international bestseller The Game, which sold 2.5m copies. It introduced a generation of men to the murky, underhand world of pickup artists and their nefarious tactics, such as negging – insulting a woman to undermine her confidence, and make her feel as if she has to seek your approval – or peacocking, where you dress flamboyantly as a talking point to hit on women. I went to university two years after The Game was published, and watched its influence spread like a virus through the men in my year: I don’t think I went on a night out in 2007 without some drunk rugby player trying to “neg” me.What was once an underground community has grown into a seduction industry valued at $100m (£75m). “The basic premise of all seduction teaching and practice is that interactions between men and women are subject to certain underlying principles that, once understood, can be readily manipulated,” explains Dr Rachel O’Neill of Warwick University, the author of Seduction: Men, Masculinity and Mediated Intimacy. “This is an impoverished view of sex and relationships, in which intimacy is less something to be experienced for its own sake and more something to be achieved for other ends.”Attending today’s workshop are Mike, a 31-year-old tech worker, and Raj, 26, who lives in Dubai and works in finance. We sit around a circular table in a panelled conference room. Oil paintings of horses stare down at us. “I’ve been doing this for 14 years,” Cassell says. “It started off as a need for myself. Now I teach other people.”Raj uses PUA terminology abundantly. “I have an issue with approach anxiety,” he says, meaning that he gets nervous hitting on women for the first time. He also refers to “sarging”, the process of picking up women. Both Raj and Mike are (perhaps unsurprisingly) edgy around me. I shunt my chair into a corner and arrange my features into a neutral expression.The workshop begins with Cassell urging Raj and Mike to pick their dream women. Raj favours Kylie Jenner Mike opts for Amber Gill, from Love Island. With the right mindset, Cassell says, they can bring their dream women into existence. He says reassuring if somewhat oblique things such as: “You are not a mass-market product,” and, “If you are getting rejected, you haven’t worked out what you want,” and, “The magic word here is, choose.” (Cassell writes “choose” on the whiteboard.)Pop psychology session over, Cassell teaches them a conversation model. When approaching a woman, they should begin by making an assumption, before using a hook to draw her into conversation. Next they should challenge her, then introduce a time constraint and close the interaction by asking for a phone number. Raj and Mike hunch over their notebooks like dutiful schoolboys.In recent years, Cassell has been describing himself as a dating coach as well as a pickup artist, and avoids the worst excesses of the PUA community, such as sexually coercive tactics. Notorious pickup artist Daryush Valizadeh – known as Roosh V – was accused of advocating legalising rape, on private property, in comments he later said were satirical. The American pickup artist Julien Blanc was banned from entering the UK in 2014, after 157,000 people signed a petition protesting against his visit. Earlier this month, pickup artist Adnan Ahmed – who called himself “Addy A-Game” – was jailed for two years after being convicted of threatening and abusive behaviour. Ahmed would harass women on the streets of Glasgow, causing them distress, and offered tips on his YouTube channel on how to overcome “last-minute resistance to sex”.While his patter is assured, Cassell’s teaching feels to me very similar to the message of Neil Strauss’s seminal pickup bible. At one point, Cassell suggests challenging a woman who is into Crossfit by telling her that Crossfit is for people who aren’t really good at any sport. This appears to be textbook negging.Conversational model learned, it’s now time for what Cassell refers to as fieldwork, but would more accurately be termed street harassment. Thus follow two of the most dispiriting hours of my career, as I walk around central London in the rain, watching as Raj and Mike pester women. They pretend to ask for directions, and after the woman has pointed out the route, say: “Actually I just wanted to talk to you,” or, “You look cute.”At one point, Mike stops two women on Oxford Street and pretends to ask for directions. After they walk on, Cassell sends Mike chasing after them – he is convinced one was being flirtatious, because she crossed her legs while speaking to Mike. (She tells him she has a boyfriend.) Outside Fortnum \u0026amp Mason on Piccadilly, there is a surreal chat about whether the men should approach a young woman shopping with her mother. Cassell decides in favour of it, but by then, thankfully, the women have moved on.As a young woman who has experienced street harassment throughout my life, it is an extraordinarily uncomfortable thing to observe. I know that, on a fundamental level, women do not want to be approached in this way by strangers on the street. Not when they are running errands, or chatting on the phone, or on their way home from work. We want men to leave us alone.But I am here to observe. So I say nothing and we squelch on through the rain. I am struck by the fact that all the women being approached are uniformly young, slim, white – and uniformly polite. They smile and refer to boyfriends, but with the exception of one woman Mike interrupts having a cigarette outside Pret – who looks furious – they do not seem put out. Why don’t any of these women tell Mike and Raj to get lost?“Women are socialised not to challenge men,” explains Dr Bianca Fileborn of the University of Melbourne, an expert in gendered street harassment. “But this response may also be about managing the situation safely.” When you confront a stranger you risk escalating the situation. “You don’t know what’s going to happen next. These are men who’ve already crossed your boundaries … deflecting them, by telling them you have a boyfriend – in effect, saying, ‘I’m the property of another man, please leave me alone’ – can be a strategy for managing the situation.”As we walk, Mike is having an internal tussle. “You do wonder, am I bothering people?” he admits. “Especially with things like #MeToo. But then I think, you’re being nice. You’ve gone up to someone and said they’re attractive.” This message – that the men are doing a good thing, and that women enjoy being hit on in the street – is continually reinforced by Cassell. He urges them on, an officer rallying his troops. “I want you to take that shot. You’re just making someone feel better about themselves.”After Raj is rejected outside Topshop (who knew so many women in central London had boyfriends?), Cassell reassures him he has done nothing wrong. “She’s going to call her friend and say: ‘Oh my God, this guy just hit on me!’ You made her day.” Outside Piccadilly Circus tube station, the cold rain whipping my face, Cassell repeats: “You’re just making someone feel better about themselves. It would be selfish not to.”That’s not true. I think I am witnessing street harassment – something Fileborn makes emphatically clear. “This behaviour has a profoundly negative impact on women. It’s often excused as flirting, or seen as good-natured. And on the inidual incident level, I can understand why you might think that: someone came and spoke to you in the street, what’s the big deal? But for many women, these aren’t one-off experiences, but are repeated constantly, often from childhood. They add up.” She sighs. “I don’t think men live with this experience of being intruded upon and having people feel entitled to your time.”On we walk. I think about the smartly dressed man who said something crude as I was having lunch at a former job. I told him not to talk to me like that. His fury was sudden and total. “Fuck you,” he snarled, as I recoiled in terror. I always remember how quickly the rage came, like it had been there all along. Eventually, we head back to the hotel. As the men write down their aspirations for the future, Cassell, surreally, puts on the score to Inception.We decamp to the hotel restaurant and eat while making stilted conversation. It is not an easy meal for anyone. The men feel that I am judging them. Mike says he thinks men should be physically stronger, so they can protect women, and waits for a response. I chew my food. Cassell tells me about a girlfriend who would prefer to pay a handyman rather than ask him for help. He didn’t like that, he says. It made him feel redundant. “What do you think about that?” Cassell says, fixing me with a cold look. I make a feeble joke.And so, to the bar where the staff know Cassell and don’t seem to mind that he is bringing men into the venue expressly to pester women. For the next three hours, Cassell identifies groups of women. The men trot over obediently. “Try that blonde at the bar,” he tells Raj. “You’d only be adding to her night. She looks bored.” Cassell suggests going up to a woman, saying “Trick or Treat?”, and then holding her wrist. At one point, Cassell sends Mike to sit with two women who are having a quiet drink. “What should I say?” Mike pleads. He is vibrating with nerves.In that moment, I feel sorry for Mike. It is easy to judge these men, but they are painfully introverted and shy – even childlike in the way they look to Cassell for answers. I don’t think they are bad people. But they are denying women the chance to exist in public spaces without being treated as objects of desire. Just to be free, without an imaginary boyfriend or a place you need to be.The night wears on. “I’m not sleazy,” Cassell says, apropos of nothing. My feet hurt and my chest feels tight with emotion. I say goodnight. Raj and Mike look relieved I’m leaving. On and on they circle, men on the prowl."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b36751615c8bc3b22ca0fdd3ae64e71f6e821389/0_0_7111_4267/master/7111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e628a1913427d59623335872d3827f2","title":"the attachment secret are you a secure avoidant or anxious partner","story":"It’s difficult to find lasting love, but by recognising your attachment type you can be more conscious in your relationships and stop self-sabotagingIt was the breakup that changed Amir Levine’s life. Fifteen years ago, he told his partner that he was falling in love with him and wanted them to move forward as a couple. His partner fled, moving across the country. The end of the relationship was especially painful for Levine. At the time he was a student at Columbia University in New York, where he is now assistant professor of clinical psychiatry. He was working in a therapeutic nursery programme, helping mothers with post-traumatic stress bond with their children. Through it, he became fascinated by the science of adult attachment.In the 1950s, the influential British psychologist and psychiatrist John Bowlby observed the lifelong impact of the earliest bonds formed in life, between children and parents, or primary caregivers: attachment theory, which has been widely researched and drawn upon since then. There are three major styles of attachment: secure, anxious and avoidant.When Levine came across attachment theory as a student, no one seemed to have applied it to adult romantic relationships but he immediately saw the relevance to his own heartbreak. His boyfriend had an avoidant attachment style.It was a revelation to Levine now he knew why their relationship hadn’t worked. “It didn’t make it less painful, but I could understand it better. I was surprised that no one had taken those concepts and translated them into something that people could use.”For 15 years, he has been doing just that, at Columbia, in private practice, and as an author. With his friend and fellow psychologist Rachel Heller, Levine wrote Attached, a practical guide to harnessing adult attachment theory to find lasting love, described by its authors as “the manual we wish we’d had when we were dating”. The idea is that by recognising your type you can identify a suitable partner, be more conscious in your relationships and stop self-sabotaging.“It’s not you, it’s my attachment style,” may sound like a gift for commitment-phobes, but the response to Attached suggests it has really helped people, says Levine. First published in 2010, the book has been updated to include stories from readers who found it “a profound relief to discover that their needs for closeness are valid”.There is an assumption that everyone has the “capacity to love in the same way”, says Levine, but our attachment styles act like programming: “It goes much deeper than communication – it affects our perception of the world, without us really knowing it.”Anxiously attached people tend to be overly preoccupied with their partners and whether they love them back, while avoidants equate intimacy with a loss of independence and deploy distancing strategies. (You can find out your type by doing the quiz at AttachedTheBook – if it is not immediately obvious.)Learning about which style they are can change people’s lives, says Levine: “They are stopped from doing the same thing that hasn’t worked for them.”You are not necessarily stuck with your style: according to a four-year study, one in four people do change over time – often as a result of a relationship with someone who has a secure attachment style.Anxious and avoidant types are drawn to each other, despite their incompatible styles: as the person seeking closeness works harder to get it, their avoidant partner pulls away, thus reaffirming their separate beliefs that relationships are unfulfilling or restrictive. Levine’s pop culture example is the film 500 Days of Summer, with Zooey Deschanel’s Manic Pixie Dream Girl character a textbook avoidant.People in anxious-avoidant relationships can change their behaviour with introspection and, often, therapy. Cate Mackenzie, a London-based psychosexual therapist, cites American couples therapist Hedy Schleifer’s turtle-and-octopus theory, in which one is inclined to retreat, the other to reach out. Mackenzie says anxious octopuses can be overly critical of avoidant turtles, who may have internalised shame about avoidance. Her aim is to soften their exchange, by encouraging both partners to open up and better understand each other, “to build a new paradigm”.But, she adds: “Even if one person was more of a turtle in another relationship, it can change – the person with the higher desire becomes the octopus.” Dr Rob Weisskirch, professor of human development at California State University, says attachment theory is a useful tool for understanding nuance in relationships, but it’s also possible to overestimate its importance. It doesn’t necessarily mean you are destined to have bad relationships.“There are plenty of external experiences that can be additive for healthy relationships,” he says. In other words, nothing is set in stone.Attached is mostly geared towards helping people who are still floundering in the dating pool – particularly anxious types, who are more vulnerable. Avoidants are relatively glossed over, Levine admits. “We never thought they were going to read this,” he says. Nevertheless, this avoidant found it an illuminating read.Levine’s dating advice is to be upfront about your needs as predetermined by your type, and to try to identify your potential partner’s type. For example, if you recognise that your anxious attachment style means it is important to you that your partner texts back quickly, make it clear early on. How they respond to a relatively low-stakes request will give you a clue to their own triggers.People tend to go with the flow and find out over time, but that initial stage is crucial, says Levine. “When it’s left up to chance, you’re lucky if you find someone who is nourishing and helpful – if you’re unlucky, you don’t. It’s important to be able to ask for what you need.”The “spark” that guides many people’s decisions doesn’t necessarily indicate long-term compatibility, he says. “And once you start to like the person, and make them special and unique to you, it’s hard to undo it.”The premium placed on a securely attached partner can create its own pressures. Avoidants often distract from promising romantic prospects by fantasising about “the one”, while Mackenzie warns that “high-achieving octopuses”, in particular, can become overly preoccupied with a checklist of traits.Levine is sympathetic to anyone who is struggling to find a partner. “When we are in a relationship we tend to forget how hard it is to be alone, to hope to find someone, to go out on yet another date. Even if you’re the one who is rejecting, dating is a very stressful time.”He and Heller make it clear that our choice of partner powerfully affects our ability to thrive in the world – and that being clear-eyed about your needs in a relationship, and what would make you happy, is the first step towards success.Attached: How the Science of Adult Attachment Can Help You Find – and Keep – Love, by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller, is published by Bluebird, £9.99.

That has to come before parliament is dissolved on Tuesday if it is to be released ahead of the election.Downing Street sources stated that was not now expected to happen in time, claiming the sign-off process typically takes six weeks. A No 10 spokesman added: “There are processes reports such as this have to go through before publication, and the committee is well-informed of these.”However, it is understood the dossier has already been approved by the intelligence agencies themselves as part of a long clearance process that began in late March. Downing Street was sent a final draft on 17 October and had been expected to sign off the report by the end of last week.Grieve said: “The protocols are quite clear. If the prime minister has a good reason for preventing publication he should explain to the committee what it is, and do it within 10 days of him receiving the report. If not, it should be published.”The dossier specifically examines Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 EU referendum. Members of the committee – which meets in secret because of the sensitivity of its work – had wanted to make recommendations to introduce greater safeguards ahead of the December poll.Ian Lucas, a Labour MP who sits on the culture media and sport select committee, which has conducted related inquiries into the conduct of the EU referendum said “the government needs to come clean about its view on Russian interference in British politics”.Ministers have argued that there are no examples of successful Russian interference in UK elections, but Lucas said that this needed to be properly tested: “This decision looks like it is designed to avoid proper scrutiny of what we actually know.”Allegations that Moscow money has flowed into the Conservative party via emigres living in the UK making high-profile donations, were also heard by the committee – although the party has consistently denied receiving money improperly.In 2014, Lubov Chernukhin – the wife of the former Russian deputy finance minister – paid £160,000 to play tennis with Johnson and David Cameron. The match was the star lot at a Conservative summer party auction. Another guest at the 2013 fundraiser was Vasily Shestakov, Vladimir Putin’s judo partner.Committee members were also briefed on an extraordinary – and for a while an apparently successful – attempt to penetrate Conservative circles by Nalobin, who instigated a pro-Kremlin parliamentary group, the Conservative Friends of Russia.During his time in the UK, Nalobin went to exclusive Tory fundraising events and met senior Conservatives. In January 2014 he posed for a photograph with Johnson at an event at city hall in London. Nalobin posted it on Twitter, writing in a caption that the then mayor was “our good friend” who said “warm words” about Russians.Conservative Friends of Russia held its 2012 launch party in the Russian ambassador’s Kensington garden, with about 250 Russian and British guests present, including Tories who went on to play a prominent role in the referendum campaign. One was Matthew Elliott, now chief executive of pro-Brexit group Vote Leave, alongside Dominic Cummings, now the prime minister’s chief strategist.Another guest was Johnson’s future girlfriend Carrie Symonds, a Tory party activist. At the time she worked in the office of John Whittingdale, the pro-Brexit MP who was the group’s honorary vice-president. The group collapsed after revelations of Nalobin’s alleged ties with the Kremlin’s SVR foreign intelligence agency.Over the weekend, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, raised questions over Cummings’ connections to Russia, and the levels of security vetting to which he had been subject, after an official whistleblower raised concerns with her.Thornberry asked if Cummings had been asked about his relationship with members of Conservative Friends of Russia, as well as the purpose of his three-year period of work in post-communist Russia between 1994 and 1997.Peers held a special debate about the withheld dossier, after an urgent question from the cross-bench peer David Anderson, a national security expert, who insisted the delay was unjustified. “It invites, I’m afraid, suspicion of the government and its motives,” he said.Earl Howe, responding for the government, told peers: “The length of time that the government had had for this report is not at all unusual. It was delivered on 17 October – that is not a very long time ago. And the prime minister is entitled to take his view on what the report contains.”Stewart McDonald, the SNP’s defence spokesman, said: “Parliament is about to be sent packing into a general election without fully understanding the extent to which Russia has meddled in our most recent democratic electoral events.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2883dfc8e1364e7ce4e08c9d955cdd1d7cc7ff89/21_25_1724_1034/master/1724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e278626b62e9482b6a46fac42769ac9","title":"brexit weekly briefing election result likely to catch out the pundits","story":"With four main parties in the fray, predicting what will happen on 12 December is devilishly difficultWelcome to the ’s weekly Brexit briefing. If you’d like to receive this as a weekly email, sign up here. You can catch our latest Brexit Means … podcast here, and for daily updates head to Andrew Sparrow’s politics live blog.After reluctantly accepting the EU’s offer of a 31 January Brexit extension and falling short of a two-thirds majority for an election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, Boris Johnson abandoned all attempts to get his Brexit deal through the Commons.Instead, the prime minister tabled a short bill to change the law in order to hold a poll on 12 December – a move that would require only a simple majority and so could be passed with the backing of the Liberal Democrats or the Scottish National party.In the event, both abstained after their preferred date of 9 December was rejected – but the Labour party, declaring the opportunity a “once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country”, backed it and it sailed through by 438 votes to 20.At the fourth time of asking – and rather than granting MPs more time to scrutinise an agreement that they had passed with a majority of 30 at second reading – Johnson had the election he wanted, Britain’s first December poll since 1923.The prime minister warned his forces it was going to be a hard campaign, however, and got an early reminder of just how hard when Nigel Farage gave him a two-week deadline to drop his Brexit deal or face a Brexit party candidate in every seat.With Farage’s party plainly set to challenge the Conservatives for every leave vote it can, Johnson felt the need to apologise to Tory members for not taking Britain out of the EU on 31 October – as he had promised to do “come what may”.He also is unlikely to have welcomed the public interventions in the UK campaign of Donald Trump, who has twice said he hopes the prime minister, a “wonderful guy”, and Farage should come together on a united political platform.Labour, which is promising to negotiate a new deal with Brussels within three months if it wins and put it to a referendum in six, is determined for once to show unity: “The debate on Brexit is over,” Jeremy Corbyn told his fractious shadow cabinet.Polls, meanwhile, put the Conservatives well ahead (although they did so, too, of course, in 2017). But tactical voting could be a game-changer, with the People’s Vote campaign preparing to start spending a £1m war chest despite a continuing conflict within the organisation.Most serious analysts and commentators warn strenuously that voter volatility, the revival of the anti-Brexit Lib Dems, the emergence of the pro-no-deal Brexit party and – as ever – the unpredictable effects of Britain’s first-past-the-post electoral system mean this will be an election of quite exceptional complexity.It would take a fool, therefore, to predict the result. But it is worth bearing in mind that victory for Johnson can only be an absolute majority in the Commons, since there is no reliable alliance he can build for his deal. Victory for the rest could mean simply getting enough seats between them to deny him that majority.Looking further forward, Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator who has just been appointed to lead the bloc’s taskforce on future relations with the UK, issued a timely reminder that ratification of the exit deal was only the start of Brexit.That future relationship still has to be hammered out – in 11 months unless the transition period is extended, which experts consider inevitable – and Barnier warned British companies could expect barriers to trade with the EU if the government seeks to abandon EU social, environmental and consumer standards.His new watchword: the EU will be happy with an agreement that features “zero tariffs, zero quotas … and zero dumping”.’s editorial said the election would be all about Brexit, whose future now rests on the result of the general election in six weeks’ time:A political scientist explains why it would be foolish for anyone to predict the election outcome:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e689f4df56890e6d07706d2dd4fa9afea005e9cc/0_427_3618_2171/master/3618.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab669faa148a8eaf601d979800d9260e","title":"government pushes ahead plans festival of brexit","story":"Figures from arts institutions fear 2022 event could alienate remain-supporting visitorsBoris Johnson’s government is pressing ahead with a controversial post-Brexit festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, inherited from Theresa May, but which the new prime minister had been urged to shelve.Dean Creamer, a delivery director for the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, has been put in charge of planning for the £120m project – dubbed the “festival of Brexit” by critics – which is due to take place in 2022, the  has learned.However, figures from arts institutions have privately expressed concern about the project, which some say is likely to alienate remain-supporting visitors at museums and galleries that are expected to take part.There had been previous warnings that the idea – announced by May in 2018 as an initiative that would “strengthen our precious union” – could inflame tensions in Northern Ireland, coming a year after the centenary of Irish partition and on the 100th anniversary of the start of the Irish civil war.The festival was billed as a showcase for “the UK’s unique strengths in creativity and innovation” with echoes of the 1851 Great Exhibition and the 1951 festival of Britain.A pledge was made to deliver “an exciting programme” of events on arts, culture, design and technology in the same year as the Queen’s platinum jubilee and to “amplify” key anniversary celebrations including the BBC’s 100th birthday and the 75th anniversary of the Edinburgh international and fringe festivals.But one person in the museum sector – one of the stakeholders identified by government planners – said: “A lot of museums are quite wary of the whole thing. There’s also a sense that if it is a festival of Brexit then it turns into an ethical issue. Half of the audiences would be completely hostile to Brexit.”In response to a freedom of information request by the , the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said it had established a festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 2022 programme board, which met regularly. Members included representatives from the Treasury and Cabinet Office. A delivery body with a budget of £120m is being appointed.Another senior figure in the culture sector said there had been talks with officials at the DCMS, but added: “Nothing has really flowed to the institutions who might be interested in it. There is infrastructure in place but everyone is waiting until the general election to see what happens next.”They added that the person in charge of planning was Creamer, who has a track record of infrastructure projects.The same source predicted: “The real challenge will be to get an artistic director. It really depends on how they seek to brand it. We expect that there would be a major effort to make it a consciously national and non-metropolitan endeavour.”It is thought the idea of the festival will appeal to Johnson’s love of set-piece events such as the Olympic Games, which he was able to capitalise on during his time as mayor of London.But the Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, the party’s spokesperson on DCMS matters, said: “I’m astounded that the government is going ahead with what is basically a Brexit festival despite everything that is going on. It is a complete waste of money at a time when funding cuts to our schools, hospitals and local services continue despite government announcements to the contrary.“The Conservatives are trying to distract us with bread and circuses, but it won’t work.”Lord Ashton of Hyde, who at the time was parliamentary under-secretary of state at the DCMS, told the House of Lords in March that the festival was an exciting opportunity to celebrate creativity and innovation across the UK, and the museum sector was expected to play an important role."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a9a961722cbb05767f14b7756ea3c5d97aa9790/82_33_1707_1024/master/1707.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e673b78b09e88154c88607b297791f7","title":"nasa voyager 2 sends back first signal from interstellar space","story":"Nasa craft is second to travel beyond heliosphere but gives most detailed data yetTwelve billion miles from Earth, there is an elusive boundary that marks the edge of the sun’s realm and the start of interstellar space. When Voyager 2, the longest-running space mission, crossed that frontier more than 40 years after its launch it sent a faint signal from the other side that scientists have now decoded.The Nasa craft is the second ever to travel beyond the heliosphere, the bubble of supersonic charged particles streaming outwards from the sun. Despite setting off a month ahead of its twin, Voyager 1, it crossed the threshold into interstellar space more than six years behind, after taking the scenic route across the solar system and providing what remain the only close-up images of Uranus and Neptune.Now Voyager 2 has sent back the most detailed look yet at the edge of our solar system – despite Nasa scientists having no idea at the outset that it would survive to see this landmark.“We didn’t know how large the bubble was and we certainly didn’t know that the spacecraft could live long enough to reach the edge of the bubble and enter interstellar space,” said Prof Ed Stone, of the California Institute of Technology, who has been working on the mission since before its launch in 1977.The heliosphere can be thought of as a cosmic weather front: a distinct boundary where charged particles rushing outwards from the sun at supersonic speed meet a cooler, interstellar wind blowing in from supernovae that exploded millions of years ago. It was once thought that the solar wind faded away gradually with distance, but Voyager 1 confirmed there was a boundary, defined by a sudden drop in temperature and an increase in the density of charged particles, known as plasma.The second set of measurements, by Voyager 2, give new insights into the nature of the heliosphere’s limits because on Voyager 1 a crucial instrument designed to directly measure the properties of plasma had broken in 1980.Measurements published in five separate papers in Nature Astronomy reveal that Voyager 2 encountered a much sharper, thinner heliosphere boundary than Voyager 1. This could be due to Voyager 1 crossing during a solar maximum (activity is currently at a low) or the craft itself might have crossed through on a less perpendicular trajectory that meant it ended up spending longer at the edge.The second data point also gives some insight into the shape of the heliosphere, tracing out a leading edge something like a blunt bullet.“It implies that the heliosphere is symmetric, at least at the two points where the Voyager spacecraft crossed,” said Bill Kurth, a University of Iowa research scientist and a co-author on one of the studies. “That says that these two points on the surface are almost at the same distance.”Voyager 2 also gives additional clues to the thickness of the heliosheath, the outer region of the heliosphere and the point where the solar wind piles up against the approaching wind in interstellar space, like the bow wave sent out ahead of a ship in the ocean.The data also feeds into a debate about the overall shape of the heliosphere, which some models predict ought to be spherical and others more like a wind sock, with a long tail floating out behind as the solar system moves through the galaxy at high speed.The shape depends, in a complex way, on the relative strengths of the magnetic fields inside and outside of the heliosphere, and the latest measurements are suggestive of a more spherical form.There are limits to how much can be gleaned from two data points, however.“It’s kind of like looking at an elephant with a microscope,” Kurth said. “Two people go up to an elephant with a microscope, and they come up with two different measurements. You have no idea what’s going on in between.”From beyond the heliosphere, the signal from Voyager 2 is still beaming back, taking more than 16 hours to reach Earth. Its 22.4-watt transmitter has a power equivalent to a fridge light, which is more than a billion billion times dimmer by the time it reaches Earth and is picked up by Nasa’s largest antenna, a 70-metre dish.The two Voyager probes, powered by steadily decaying plutonium, are projected to drop below critical energy levels in the mid-2020s. But they will continue on their trajectories long after they fall silent. “The two Voyagers will outlast Earth,” said Kurth. “They’re in their own orbits around the galaxy for 5bn years or longer. And the probability of them running into anything is almost zero.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70b4473fd43a9022964a7a2455fece8fa6ed941f/0_0_1312_787/master/1312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=566ec81d7f987850e0c6695957458c68","title":"voyager 2 story of mission so far in pictures","story":"Since launching in 1977, the Nasa probe has captured never-before-seen images of the solar system"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dba453f2b36dd55cc4f029f70a15bbae9467987/0_23_6586_3954/master/6586.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a9aa34c2367da8c7a9f3004bfc0a8b0","title":"tories broke pledge on starter homes in 2015 manifesto report says","story":"National Audit Office says no starter homes have been built despite election pledgeSuccessive Conservative governments have failed to deliver a single new “starter home” despite promising to build 200,000 by 2020, Whitehall’s spending watchdog has found.The party’s 2015 manifesto committed to building the homes across England to be sold exclusively to first-time buyers under the age of 40, to help young people take their first step on the property ladder.The National Audit Office (NAO) said that, to date, no such homes have been built because the government has not budgeted for them or activated all of the necessary legislation.The 2015 spending review set aside £2.3bn to support the delivery of the first 60,000 properties under the scheme.But the Ministry of Housing, Communities \u0026amp Local Government (MHCLG) no longer has a budget dedicated to the project, auditors said in a report released on Tuesday.Funding that had been earmarked for the scheme has instead been spent on acquiring and preparing brownfield sites for housing more generally – some of which was “affordable” housing.The Housing and Planning Act 2016 created the statutory framework for the project to go ahead, but the NAO said the relevant sections of the legislation had yet to come into force.The report said, while it was possible developers had built and sold some properties that met the starter home criteria, legally they could not be marketed as such until the MHCLG had put in place the necessary secondary legislation.Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, said: “Despite setting aside over £2bn to build 60,000 new starter homes, none were built.“Since 2010 many housing programmes announced with much fanfare have fallen away, with money then recycled into the next announcement.“The department needs to focus on delivery and not raise, and then dash, people’s expectations.”The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, said: “The Conservatives’ flagship housing announcement for first-time buyers has been a total failure. It’s clear you can’t trust the Tories to do what they promise.”The report comes as a new coalition of housing organisations has called for all new homes to be made accessible and adaptable.The organisation, Housing Made for Everyone (HoME), includes Age UK, the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba), Disability Rights UK, the National Housing Federation, and the Chartered Institute of Housing.It has published an open letter calling on the next government to take greater action to secure housing suitable for an ageing population and people living with disabilities.It reads: “Without action, we face an ever-mounting bill, with councils spending greater sums on trying to adapt homes retrospectively and the costs to our health and social care systems spiralling.“The cost to iniduals is no less damaging. Now is the time to ensure that everyone’s right to a safe and accessible home is met, today and in the years to come.”Anna Dixon, the chief executive at the Centre for Ageing Better, which is part of the coalition, said: “We face a dangerous shortage of homes that are accessible and adaptable.“Whilst it’s not inevitable, the likelihood is that most of us will experience disability or difficulties with activities of daily living at some point in our later life.“And with more of us living for longer, this dire lack of accessible homes represents a ticking timebomb.”An MHCLG spokesperson said: “We are committed to building more homes and supporting people into home ownership. We have a great track record and housebuilding is at its highest level for all but one of the last 30 years – with 222,000 homes delivered last year, and 1.3m in total since 2010, including over 430,000 affordable homes.“The number of first-time buyers is currently at an 11-year annual high, and over 560,000 households have been helped into home ownership through government schemes like help to buy and right to buy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ba82aaa48df5a06218fc48dbae5096dc05f6de3/0_69_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9911b80a07f207e6d9eebee7493bba9e","title":"uk parents drinking negatively affects over third children study","story":"Significant link found between amount of alcohol consumed and adverse impact on childrenMore than a third of children in the UK are negatively affected by their parents’ alcohol use, research has suggested.The study, which examined the effects of non-dependent drinking, found a significant link between the amount of alcohol consumed by parents and increased negative experiences among children who witness them in a drunk or tipsy state.It also confirmed previous findings that children were more than twice as likely to report a negative outcome if their parents had negative motives for drinking – regardless of how much alcohol they consumed.The children surveyed – who were aged between 10 and 17 – reported negative experiences that included being given less attention than usual, being put to bed earlier or later than their usual time, having arguments with parents more than normal, and being at the receiving end of increased unpredictability.The chief medical officers\u0027 guideline for both men and women states that to keep health risks from alcohol to a low level it is safest not to drink more than 14 units a week on a regular basisThe guidelines say that if you regularly drink as much as 14 units per week, it is best to spread your drinking evenly over three or more days. If you have one or two heavy drinking episodes a week, you increase your risk of long-term illness and injury.The risk of developing a range of health problems increases the more you drink on a regular basis.Ian Hamilton, an expert in addiction and mental health from the University of York, said being sent to bed early may seem trivial, along with the other effects listed, but if regularly experienced could have a lasting detrimental impact.“Likewise, I suspect many parents will be unaware of how a drug like alcohol can affect interactions with their children, or even be aware that alcohol has any impact,” he said.“It is not surprising that alcohol is used by parents who are struggling with their mental health and feelings alcohol is easier to access than professional support and always available.”He added: “With cutbacks to mental health services alcohol may be the only way that some people feel they can cope with their feelings and they may be oblivious to the impact it has on those around them.”Eric Appleby, the chair of the Alcohol and Families Alliance, which brings together groups from across the voluntary and statutory sectors, said the finding that a third of children have had a negative experience from their parents’ drinking should trouble the government.“The resources and support available to parents who want to learn more about or address their drinking are inadequate,” he said. “We need evidence-based support for families affected by alcohol and evidence-based guidance on parental and family member drinking and its effect on children, including at low levels.”In 2009 the then chief medical officer of England, Sir Liam Donaldson, published the first official guidance on alcohol that was focused specifically on children and young people.It advised parents on how their low-level drinking might influence children’s own alcohol use but the researchers said it did not mention its direct impact on them. The study’s lead author, Lucy Bryant from the Institute of Alcohol Studies, called for the guidance to be updated so parents could make “informed decisions”.Britons get drunk more than people in 35 other leading economies do, according to a recent global survey, and thousands of people die every year from related illnesses, particularly liver disease."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7577c34040bc2d4cf4020ba537983d822256bd24/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=534df1cb7defd29160ec138be7c7b102","title":"welfare changes key factor rising poverty food bank use study finds","story":"Research says evidence ‘clear’ policies such as universal credit can cause destitutionWelfare changes such as universal credit and the bedroom tax are a key factor in the sharp increase in food bank use and the re-emergence of extreme poverty in the UK over the past seven years, an academic study has concluded.According to the research, there is “clear and robust evidence” that people struggling on the lowest rungs of the income ladder are pushed rapidly into destitution when their already tight budgets are broken by benefit payment delays, cuts, deductions or sanctions.The study found five key welfare policies – the rollout of universal credit, increases in benefit sanctions, the bedroom tax, the benefits freeze and the withdrawal of disability benefits – had “sizeable and significant effects” in pushing up demand for food parcels.One in 50 UK households used a food bank in 2018-19, the study estimated, while at least 3m food parcels were given out – highlighting the rise in charity welfare and the impact of austerity cuts since the start of the decade, when only a small number of food banks existed.The study calculated the average income of households using food banks was £50 a week after rent. Nine out of 10 people referred to food banks were destitute, meaning they struggled to afford to eat regularly, clothe or clean themselves or their families, the study found.The State of Hunger 2019 report was compiled by Heriot-Watt University academics for the Trussell Trust food bank charity. The year-long study examined how many people were affected by hunger, who was most affected and what drove people to food banks.The Trussell Trust chief executive, Emma Revie, called on ministers to make urgent changes to the benefits system, including removing the five-week wait for a first universal credit payment and uprating the value of benefits. “Hunger in the UK isn’t about food – it’s about people not having enough money,” she said.The links between welfare changes, food bank use and destitution have been fiercely contested in recent years, with the government for the most part refusing to acknowledge clear evidence of any association between extreme poverty and welfare policies that have cut tens of billions of pounds from the benefits budget.The figures were calculated by experts from across the political spectrum who make up the Social Metrics Commission, set up in 2016 to develop\u0026nbspa new way of measuring poverty.In cash terms, the Social Metrics Commission says \u0027deep poverty\u0027 is considered to be a couple with two children who have an income of less than £211 a week after housing costs, or a single parent with one child on less than £101.50 a week. A \u0027destitution\u0027 level of income is £140 a week for a couple with two children.Disability is one of the strongest predictors of being in poverty. Nearly half of all those living below the breadline live in a household where someone is disabled.The research, however, concluded food bank use was “driven by economic need”, noting those dependent on charity food parcels were typically also in poor health, exposed to challenging life experiences such as loss of a job or orce, and lacked access to informal family support.For nearly nine out of 10 food bank users, state benefits were a main source of income, and low or interrupted benefit payments were the main trigger of food bank demand. Universal credit, which requires new claimants to wait at least five weeks without income, is identified as the key driver of food bank reliance.The study estimated that for every 100 claimants moving on to universal credit in a year, an additional 27 food parcels were issued compared with the predecessor benefit. For every 100 households subject to the bedroom tax, an additional 68 parcels were given out. There were 31 extra food parcels distributed for every 100 benefit sanctions.The withdrawal or refusal of disability benefits had a significant effect on food bank use, with every 100 failed personal independence payment assessments in a year associated with the distribution of an extra 93 food parcels.Hunger and food bank use affected women disproportionately: they were twice as likely to be food insecure as men, because they were more likely to skip meals so their children could eat, while single mothers accounted for about a fifth of all food bank users.More than three-quarters of households who used food banks were in arrears, with nearly half of these behind on two or more bills – most commonly rent and council tax. Geographically, food bank usage is most concentrated in former industrial areas of the north and Midlands as well as some coastal towns and London boroughs.The study drew on official data as well as food bank statistics and interviews with food bank managers and users, and agencies who refer people to food banks. It measured demand for food parcels while factoring in the rise in the number of food banks in recent years. There are now at least 2,000 in the UK.A DWP spokesperson said: “We take this report very seriously and continue to work closely with the Trussell Trust on this important issue. We spend more than £95bn a year on the welfare safety net, but we continue to make improvements to get people the support they need and prevent them falling through the cracks.“Already we have simplified the benefits system with universal credit, making it easier for people to access support. And this week we have announced working-age benefits will rise in line with inflation from April, giving millions of people more money in their pockets.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d010df81c370f4372f5ba16d2572e66521c6302/0_41_3429_2058/master/3429.jpg?width=3250\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8f3c5fb29f7be4d2c4fd60af139882a 6500w","title":"england snatch defeat from jaws of victory in third new zealand t20","story":"Eoin Morgan is not the type of captain to throw his players under the bus. But after England collapsed to a 14-run defeat under sunny skies in Nelson, one wondered whether a touch of exasperation sat beneath the surface as regards one or two. Set 181 to win the third Twenty20 with New Zealand following an improved performance in the field – led by the Curran brothers, Tom and Sam - the tourists looked to be cruising, needing 44 from the final 34 deliveries with eight wickets in hand.A 34-ball 55 from Dawid Malan had handed England the ideal platform and with James Vince and Morgan himself then set at the crease, just one calm head was required to take a 2-1 lead with two matches remaining.Morgan holing out for 18 when attempting a third six off Mitch Santner’s final over began a cascade of five English wickets in 19 balls. New Zealand, who earlier posted 180 for six through Colin de Grandhomme’s broad-shouldered 55 from 35, applied the squeeze superbly. “We didn’t do the simple things right, we didn’t establish a partnership, we didn’t hit with the wind – things that the Black Caps did throughout,” said Morgan after his side limped to 166 for seven by the end. “The lack of experience may have cost us. It’s great how competitive the series is so far and integrating everyone into the squad. But we feel that’s one that got away.”It is true that the XI on show was light by way of caps. Jonny Bairstow was stood down so that Tom Banton could make his much-anticipated debut. The 20-year-old Somerset opener crackled, briefly, with 18 from 10 including an eye-popping whipped six off Lockie Ferguson, and there is a raft of first-teamers only just setting down in New Zealand to begin preparations for the Test series.But given four of the top five batsmen are 28 or older, the excuse doesn’t stack up entirely either. Malan had spoke of “feeding on scraps” as regards England opportunities, and a desire to be the man who finishes off matches. Here, he looked in full control en route to a fifth half-century in eight games - only to stick a full toss from Ish Sodhi down deep midwicket’s throat.Morgan had been tucking into Santner and so was probably within his rights to attempt his shot, only for the left-armer to cannily hold it back a touch. But Vince was still at the crease approaching a second half-century of the series and was joined by Sam Billings, a player with 39 white-ball caps and vice-captain on tour.Within the blink of an eye, both men had been vapourised. Billings was run out by Colin Munro from point turning back from a single that never was. Vince, owner of a World Cup winner’s medal and a county captain, gave the recalled Blair Tickner his second for the innings by chipping softly to mid-off.With Ferguson signing off from the series to start his own Test tune-up by knocking over Lewis Gregory and Sam Curran in the space of three balls, the 5,000 or so home supporters who lined the grass banks, and took in the spectacular backdrop of Mount Richmond Forest Park, were in clover.They had earlier seen De Grandhomme at his belligerent best, following a 17-ball 33 from Martin Guptill with five fours and three sixes that showed just how good conditions were. But England, handed Matt Parkinson his first cap along with Banton, pegged the hosts back at regular intervals, such that the highest total of the series was still only par.Tom Curran, recalled in place of Chris Jordan, held a fine swirling catch off Guptill as the opener was fooled by a knuckle-ball from his Worcestershire team-mate, Pat Brown. The right-armer was the pick of the attack with two wickets, including de Grandhomme, who was caught in the deep to end a stand of 66 with Ross Taylor.Parkinson, in for Adil Rashid, bowled just two tidy overs due to the wind picking up later on when New Zealand had two left-handers at the crease. The leg-spinner did claim his maiden international scalp, No 3 Tim Seifert bowled through his legs playing a reverse slog sweep, and looked confident on debut.It was a trickier day for his fellow Lancastrian, Saqib Mahmood, who struggled with his radar, was manhandled by de Grandhomme while leaking 49 runs overall, but at least trapped Taylor lbw in his final over.Sam Curran doused a quickfire 22 from Jimmy Neesham and after three matches is looking the pick of the newcomers with the ball. The all-rounder looked too high coming in at No 6 later on, however, once the full-time – dare we say experienced – batsmen had blown it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ffd2549ff36399c3862d5502c122cd2f0f30eaf/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89621c463ce4c6d684f0273041304832","title":"rugby world cup 2019 guardian writers teams of the tournament","story":"The hosts’ Michael Leitch deserves a special mention while England’s Tom Curry and Handre Pollard cannot be omittedWhile South Africa’s final surge tipped the scales in a couple of positions, Pieter-Steph du Toit is an unlucky absentee. But how could you possibly omit the incredible Japan captain, Michael Leitch, or the youthful Tom Curry from the back row? Only one All Black tells its own story but the semi-final against England defined New Zealand’s World Cup. There is one place too, for an Argentinian – the hooker Julián Montoya. Handre Pollard kicked almost everything when it mattered, Kyle Sinckler and Maro Itoje are included on merit and Faf de Klerk is selected both for his nuisance value and world-class ability to spin the ball on one finger. John Denver’s ageless Take Me Home, Country Roads is the official team soundtrack.Dominated by the finalists and the home nation. Not an abundance of fly-halves to choose from whereas there are too many locks to select only two. Josh Adams can count himself unlucky to miss out on the left wing but Jonny May did not put a foot wrong for England. Michael Leitch is in, as much for his inspirational leadership of Japan, as for his talent.It pains me to leave out Michael Leitch and Kenki Fukuoka but Josh Adams’ seven tries are hard to argue with and Tom Curry proved himself the best young player in the world. Japan’s Shota Horie does make the front row. George Ford has a case at fly-half but given the way Handre Pollard tied South Africa together, he was the tournament’s most indispensable player. Tendai Mtawarira is there because of his scrummaging in the final and Pieter-Steph du Toit squeezed out Sam Underhill off the back of that match, too. Kieran Read squeezes in because of the way he played against Ireland.It was a tournament more notable for impressive team performances than inidual ones but not exclusively. The likes of Jake Polledri, Torsten van Jaarsveld and Samu Kerevi stood out in teams who did not make a lasting impact. There was also a case for exceptional leaders like Siya Kolisi, Michael Leitch, Alun Wyn Jones and Kieran Read. Some positions, back-row, hooker and midfield, had more candidates than others, fly-half and full-back especially.Selecting the back row is an almost impossible task – leaving out Siya Kolisi, Duane Vermeulen and Tom Curry seems wrong but I can’t quite countenance not including Michael Leitch or Sam Underhill. And somehow there is no space for a South African in the second row, despite their outstanding lineout. Handre Pollard pips George Ford and Yu Tamura at fly-half because his composure in the final two matches was crucial. Sometimes a cameo leaves the most lasting impression – step up Namibia’s Torsten van Jaarsveld in 40 minutes of dynamism against an All Black tide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4b979f8d4a722a29df177550024d16cb082c121/0_86_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d48f681cf6f5f176560ba0c31f05a11f","title":"australia v pakistan second twenty20 international live","story":"Steve Smith hit 80 from 51 balls as Australia cruised to victory in Canberra to take a 1-0 series lead after the first game was washed outThis reworked T20 side has been imperious on home turf, and so it proved again tonight. Smith didn’t even need to bat in the first match of the season against Sri Lanka, and didn’t get a chance in the first against Pakistan. But he’s made up for that tonight with an outstanding 80 from 51 balls. I had some doubts that he was the most logical pick for this format, given the powerful scorers at Australia’s disposal who aren’t playing, but for situations like this with a mid-range total and a few early wickets against good bowlers, there’s no one better. And there was nothing wrong with his scoring rate tonight. He looked mint. Pakistan had their moments, when Iftikhar was batting at the end of their innings, and when their bowlers threatened to squeeze the chase. But even though Finch and Warner didn’t make huge scores today, they made a fast start that already put the game well in Australia’s favour. Smith took it from there.There’ll be one more match against Pakistan on Friday night, then the Test season begins. But Australia’s early prep for the T20 World Cup in a year’s time has so far looked good. 18.3 overs: Australia 151-3 (Smith 80, Turner 8) A wide, a couple of singles, and Amir sees the match to the end that always looked likely. 18th over: Australia 148-3 (Smith 79, Turner 7) You know how sometimes in training batsmen will turn the bat side-on, and try to play using only the edge? Smith just did that, deliberately, playing an uppercut at Wahab Riaz. Landed it flush on the fat edge of his bat, and lifted it over fine leg for four. Next he opens up his stance and slaps an off-drive over the field for another boundary. This is some display. 17th over: Australia 136-3 (Smith 68, Turner 6) Smith. Smith, Smith, Smith. He’s had enough of pottering. Amir comes back, Pakistan’s blue-chip bowler, and Smith just takes him apart. Three boundaries through the off side, each of them distinct in shape and style. Each drives, of a sort, but played standing still, hand-eye contact only, all wrists, opening up space at cover, carving, slapping, slashing, those rubbery limbs that define Smith’s off-side play. That was something to see. 16th over: Australia 121-3 (Smith 55, Turner 5) Just the four runs from Shadab’s final over, and he finishes with 0 for 25 from his spell tonight. Australia need 30 from 24 balls from here.15th over: Australia 117-3 (Smith 54, Turner 2) Yet another international half-century for Smith – his fourth in this format, compared to 50 of them between Tests and ODIs. He gets there with a very Steve Smith shot, a wristy whip of a full ball from Irfan, away through wide long-on. 14th over: Australia 109-3 (Smith 47, Turner 1) Ashton Turner is next in, a powerful hitter of the ball, and he’ll start against Shadab’s spin. Just the three singles as Australia consolidate. 13th over: Australia 106-3 (Smith 45) Imad is conceding ones and twos, but that’s all the batsmen need by now. Smith is running the second runs hard. But from the last ball of the over McDermott tries to sweep, misses, and is hit on the waist in front of off stump while kneeling. He reviews it, but the ball-tracking isn’t working for some reason. That’s interesting. So Australia will lose the review even though there’s no way to tell if it’s umpire’s call, presumably? 12th over: Australia 101-2 (Smith 43, McDermott 18) It was odd that Wahab came on so late, but that means that he can’t be taken out of the attack if Babar wants four overs from him. So he has to continue after his messy over. McDermott manages to slice a boundary behind point. Nearly gets run out again later in the over, produces another big e. Australia need 50 from 48. 11th over: Australia 91-2 (Smith 42, McDermott 9) Imad is back, and produces a tidy over of spin for his captain. Five singles from it. 10th over: Australia 86-2 (Smith 40, McDermott 6) Sheesh, what a jumble sale of an over. Wahab bowls a no-ball, then tries a bouncer to defend the free hit but gets called for a wide. Then Smith whacks the free hit straight for four, then there’s another no-ball, this time too high, and Smith carts that for four as well. He can’t take full toll of the second free hit, then McDermott nearly runs himself out. He did that four times in a row in the UAE last year, but this time he manages to e home. 9th over: Australia 75-2 (Smith 34, McDermott 4) Unlike Pakistan’s first half an innings, the early wickets haven’t stopped Australia finding a boundary or two each over. Smith does it again, slicing Shadab’s leggie away through extra, in between harvesting singles. That sort of play just makes the target melt away. 8th over: Australia 66-2 (Smith 27, McDermott 2) You can watch how fast Smith’s brain-computer works. The first ball of Irfan’s over he’s done for bounce, trying to punch off the back foot but beaten over the bat, nearly nicking. But once he knows what to expect, he carves away two boundaries, one an uppercut, one over point. He’s just... so good.7th over: Australia 57-2 (Smith 18, McDermott 2) Shadab Khan is on, the leg-spinning all-rounder, bowling straight and fast with the option for a googly. He bowls tight, singles from five of the balls, but Smith skips down to the fifth and lifts it gently over the bowler and away for four. Supreme control against spin from Smith, that’s the great boon that he can be for Australia in the white-ball formats. 6th over: Australia 48-2 (Smith 11, McDermott 0) One run and one wicket from the over. A fine comeback for Irfan. McDermott the next in for Australia, filling in for Glenn Maxwell who is on personal leave. The other opener gone! Finch battered Mohammad Irfan for 26 from an over the other night. Tonight, the big bowler draws three false shots from Smith and then Finch with the short ball, twice swinging and missing against his extra bounce. The fifth of the over, Finch tries to clear it off the back foot over cover, but skews the shot and gives up a steepling catch to mid-off. 5th over: Australia 47-1 (Finch 17, Smith 10) A slip in for Smith, and Amir looking for swing, looking for the edge. One ball is too much on leg stump though, and Smith plays the same shot that had him caught so memorably by Sheldon Cottrell in the World Cup match at Trent Bridge: the lofted flick off the pads behind square. This time he gets more of it, and there is a man out there but it clears him for six! Unorthodox but got it! Amir follows up with a swinging yorker, but Smith gets something on it. Good battle.4th over: Australia 38-1 (Finch 16, Smith 2) Imad Wasim almost bowls a brilliant over. Almost. Four singles in five balls. A decent ball for the sixth, tight on off stump. But Finch is in such good touch on a true surface that he punches on the back foot, and threads it between point and backward point along the ground for four. What placement. 3rd over: Australia 30-1 (Finch 10)He’s out! Warner has been unbeaten for three innings in a row in this format, but not this time. Mohammad Amir makes the point that he should have taken the first over. Starts to get a bit of swing, gets forced away by Finch for four, but when Warner takes the last ball of the over the batsman backs away, looking to smash an off-stump line over cover. Instead Amir bowls straighter, angling in at leg stump from wide on the crease. Beats Warner’s shot and lights up the stumps. 2nd over: Australia 25-0 (Warner 20, Finch 5) Imad’s left-arm spin is very economical in the Powerplay generally, but Warner is happy to go over cover for four. Imad comes left-arm around the wicket to the left-hander, trying to cramp him for room, but Warner is awake to it and twice backs away to make space. He hits squarer for the second boundary. So Imad comes over the wicket to bowl at the pads, and Warner should glance it for four but misses. No matter, the fourth ball is full and Warner lofts over wide long-on! One bounce into the fence. Australia off to a flyer! Compounded when the ball leaps at him from a length, takes a thick edge, and flies fine through third man for another. 16 for Warner from the over!1st over: Australia 9-0 (Warner 4, Finch 5) Wahab Riaz is on the broadcasters’ interview mic saying that they’ll pitch the ball up and look for swing under lights. But first with the ball is Mohammad Irfan, the seven-foot giant, and he exclusively bowls back of a length. The batsmen take a few sighters, steer singles and a two, then Finch stands up tall to clobber four on the square cut. That was too easy. Where is Wahab? Where’s Amir? The spinner Imad will bowl the second over. It was laborious at times, but this is the template that Pakistan have used so successfully in the UAE. Bat first, have Babar cruise through most of the innings, find a late flurry from somewhere to get up around 150. Then use their spinners, pace change, and perhaps some reverse swing to defend it. It works there, but these are much nicer batting tracks in Australia, so it’s much less likely to work here. But Pakistan have a score to defend thanks to Iftikhar’s late intervention, and a quality and varied bowling attack. Australia have two very in-form opening batsmen, Finch and Warner. This should be good to watch.20th over: Pakistan 150-6 (Iftikhar 62, Wahab 0) Wahab Riaz comes out as the professional runner, and hares up and back as Iftikhar finds two runs from each of the last two balls. No boundary, but he’s done a fine job with his 62 from 35 balls, getting Pakistan to 150.A tactical run-out for Imad, desperate to get Iftihkar back on strike for the last couple of balls of the innings. The pair only got singles from the first three balls, so Imad was running for two no matter what on the fourth ball. 19th over: Pakistan 142-5 (Iftikhar 56, Imad 9) Kane Richardson to bowls his final over, and Iftikhar lofts him for six! Lovely straight hit, from a stable base, snapping through the line of the fuller ball and landing it over the rope! Richardson is having a dirty day, as it turns out, after riding high from his first over. The perils of this form of cricket. Next up, Iftikhar swings, edges, four! Top edge over the wicketkeeper, just over. Carey was searching for it but it had a couple of inches elevation too much. So Richardson tries his wide yorker, but misses it. Carved over backward point for four! Warner is thinking of the catch, ran in, the ball dips on him at the last minute and he loses it in the lights. It bounces in front of him and through him. That raises the batsman’s first 50 in this format. Last ball of the over, Richardson pitches up, and Iftikhar sends him downtown for six more! Parried over the rope by McDermott, who runs around, leaps, and doesn’t have the presence of mind to just try the save rather than the catch. Fingertips it over the rope.There’s that big over, 22 from it. 1 for 51 from Richardson’s four. Ouch. 18th over: Pakistan 120-5 (Iftikhar 35, Imad 8) Mitchell Starc to close out, two overs left for him. Full, fast, and once more there’s only one boundary from the over. A nice one, Imad driving the full ball along the ground through cover, but Pakistan need a massive over at some stage to have something to bowl at, and they can’t find it. 17th over: Pakistan 114-5 (Iftikhar 35, Imad 2) Imad Wasim, the lefty all-rounder, is next in. Iftikhar takes the reins, steering Cummins away behind point for four. That’s the only boundary from the over though. He tries for a second, timing it out into the deep at square leg, but Smith drops the catch!16th over: Pakistan 106-5 (Iftikhar 29) Another boundary from Agar! Two from the over, unheard of. Just enough width, and Iftikhar lifts him over cover, in between the two sweepers for four. Singles otherwise, until the last ball, when Babar turns to come back for the second. Warner is in the deep at midwicket, does it sensationally. Charges in off the fence. Picks up one-handed. Stutters his feet to steady. Unleashes the throw. Hits the base of the stumps direct. Babar gets his 50th run, then is dismissed trying for his 51st. 15th over: Pakistan 97-4 (Babar 47, Iftikhar 23) Iftikhar goes! Richardson comes back to end the spin-twin section, and the hitherto quiet Pakistani batsman lifts him cleanly over mid-off for four. Then goes again, heaving over midwicket for six. Clean connection on a ground the size of the MCG, and lands it well back in the crowd. He nails the next two balls just as cleanly, along the ground this time, but Warner puts in a great sprint and e at deep point, then McDermott gets around to save from long-on. Both times the batsmen take two. The over costs 14 without Babar scoring. That’s what this team needs, some support for their main man. 14th over: Pakistan 83-4 (Babar 47, Iftikhar 9) Zampa’s last over, and the singles continue! They’ve gone four overs without a boundary, Pakistan. This is a good batting surface, don’t get the wrong idea. They just can’t get going against this bowling. Zampa flights up the last couple of balls of his night’s work, and ends up with a tidy enough 0 for 31 from his four overs. 13th over: Pakistan 78-4 (Babar 45, Iftikhar 6) Five runs from the Cummins over, in ones and twos. There’s really no point to the way Pakistan are going about this. 12th over: Pakistan 73-4 (Babar 44, Iftikhar 2) Another outstanding over for Agar, four singles from it. He’s been absolutely miserly in every match of these two series, and grabbed two wickets thus far today. Another cheap one! Babar was furious after his batting partner didn’t run back for a second from the first ball of the over. Asif tries to send the next ball from Agar over the fence to cheer up his captain, but Manuka Oval is one of the biggest playing surfaces in the world, and he’s comfortably held at deep midwicket. 11th over: Pakistan 69-3 (Babar 42, Asif 4) Having seen Australian teams so often lose their way against spin through the middle overs of limited-overs games in the last few years, it must be cheering for Justin Langer and company to see their own spinners dishing out the same. Zampa takes advantage of the match situation to keep them to singles: once, twice, thrice, four-ice? Fice? Quintuply? I don’t know. Five singles, then a deuce from the last ball as Asif drives too straight for the long-on sweeper to restrict. 10th over: Pakistan 62-3 (Babar 39, Asif 0) A carbon copy of the first game so far. Babar building a decent score but at a moderate clip, Asif Ali joining him at the halfway point with the top order wilting. A rare boundary from Agar, as Babar waits back and sweeps it down to deep backward, beating Ben McDermott’s e. But Agar gets some consolation from the fifth ball, following Rizwan with a fast flat ball as the batsman comes down the wicket and outside the line of leg, trying to give space to carve over cover. Instead the ball darts between bat and pad, and into Carey’s gloves. 9th over: Pakistan 56-2 (Babar 34, Rizwan 13) Time to go, at last. Rizwan is the first to drop the hammer, down on one knee to Zampa and dragging a swat shot away through midwicket, just beating the man at long-on who runs around. A single rotates the strike, then Babar comes skipping down the wicket and drives gloriously straight down the ground for four! That’s more like it. A baker’s dozen off the over.8th over: Pakistan 43-2 (Babar 27, Rizwan 7) Ashton Agar now with the ball, left-arm orthodox and he’s been bowling very accurately in this series. He fields brilliantly off his first ball, ing across as Rizwan shouldered the ball back at him, then Agar flicks down the length of the pitch to Carey behind the stumps, and Rizwan just es back into his ground. As so often this season, there is no boundary from Agar’s over. Five singles and a leg bye. Pakistan going at about five an over.7th over: Pakistan 38-2 (Babar 25, Rizwan 5) Zampa came on to bowl during the Powerplay in Sydney and got carted by Pakistan’s batsmen. Today Finch holds him back to the seventh over as per convention for spinners. Not a bad time to bowl, and today they only take ones and twos from his first over rather than sixes.6th over: Pakistan 32-2 (Babar 23, Rizwan 1) The brakes are well and truly on. Mohammad Rizwan to the middle, but it takes him four balls from Cummins to get off the mark with a single. 5th over: Pakistan 29-2 (Babar 21) Except that losing momentum is exactly what happens for Pakistan. Another quiet over, with Richardson bowling tightly and changing pace, and Haris Sohail only able to club a couple of runs to the deep. So he decides the last ball has to go, charges it, slogs to leg, and hits it a mile up in the air and straight back down to where it came from. 4th over: Pakistan 25-1 (Babar 20, Sohail 3) Haris Sohail comes out at three, and nudges the same number of runs. Pakistan can’t afford to let the momentum of their innings dip like they did on Sunday. He dodged the golden duck, but another failure for Fakhar. Cummins the change bowler, went full, Fakhar tries to clear mid-off but it’s too low, and Warner closing down the angle can e across and take a fairly comfortable catch.3rd over: Pakistan 22-0 (Babar 20, Fakhar 2) That’s even better from Babar. Starc bowls short, not a bouncer but torso height. Outside off. Babar is already coming forward to drive, so from the front foot he carves with a horizontal bat through cover again! Four! And another, as Starc moves his line across so Babar lifts him over square leg, just using the pace to dink another boundary away. 2nd over: Pakistan 14-0 (Babar 12, Fakhar 2) Oh, gorgeous duo from Babar. The first two balls of Richardson’s over, one driven conventionally through the covers, the next forced off the back foot the same way. Richardson shortened his length for the second ball but it went the same way as the first. His third cuts back into Babar and nearly spins back onto the stumps from the thigh pad. No swing tonight. So he bowls the slow bouncer and gets muscled for a couple. 1st over: Pakistan 3-0 (Babar 1, Fakhar 2) Away we go. Mitch Starc has the ball, Babar the strike. And the first is a big full toss, overpitched looking for swing, but so fast that Babar can only block it away. The next is wider, and just as on Sunday, Babar reaches for it and zips it to third man for a run. Fakhar was gone for a golden duck the other day, and nearly doubles up, the ball almost sneaking through onto his pad. He gets a touch on it though, back to the bowler, and Babar has to e back into the non-striker’s end. Again he’s tied up on his pads, but eventually Starc offers width and Fakhar just steers it square of third man for two, well run for the second. England are also playing T20s in the southern part of the world, over in New Zealand. They managed to lose a game last night when they were cruising: needed about 42 from 30 with eight wickets in hand, but New Zealand put on the clamps. Here’s Ali Martin’s report. Both teams unchanged from Sunday afternoon. Babar Azam calls correctly, after some confusion with Aaron Finch who thought he had won, but Babar wants to bat and Finch wants to bowl so it doesn’t make a difference in the end. Babar is taking the straightforward route, get a total and put no pressure with early wickets. Finch thinks there might be a bit of dew later so he’d rather take the ball first. It’s chilly in Canberra. 16 degrees at the moment, a low of 6 expected overnight. The Australians are mostly warming up in hoodies and beanies at the moment. Evening from Australia kindly adjust that greeting for your timezone. It’s cricket time again, as it has been every couple of days through these back-to-back T20 series that Australia has scheduled. Tonight, the second match against Pakistan, who are still in the hunt despite being thoroughly outplayed on Sunday night because rain saved them from a loss with 11 balls to spare. The Australian openers were well on track to chase down Pakistan’s low total, but didn’t face the five overs required to have the game formally recognised as a result before rain washed out the day. Now Pakistan have the chance to regroup, while the Australians will look to carry on their recent dominant run, 3-0 over Sri Lanka and starting well here. The toss will take place in a minute.

In the coming weeks, a new multicolored, all-caps logo will begin appearing across its services. Instagram and Whatsapp, owned by the company, will proudly tell users that they are services “from FACEBOOK”.Facebook is the social network you hate FACEBOOK is the company you didn’t know you loved.But why FACEBOOK? The upper-case logo proves the company’s worthiness. It’s designed with “clarity and openness” in mind, a blogpost explains, with “harmonized capital letters”. All checks out: after all, what is FACEBOOK if not a place of openness and harmony?And that’s not all. FACEBOOK uses “dynamic” colors, with the logo “taking on the color of its environment”. The company calls this “an empathetic color palette”, which makes sense. Blue is just mean, but bright green understands me. On top of that, “the subtle softening of corners and diagonals adds a sense of optimism”. Who could look at the new FACEBOOK and not feel renewed hope coursing through their veins?The rebrand has prompted general eye-rolling – the AV Club’s Allison Shoemaker points out that even peppering the logo with unicorns would not save the company’s image. But that won’t stop marketing teams from trying.Just last month, Yahoo went the opposite direction, opting for a lowercase yahoo! in an effort, as Chaim Gartenberg noted at the Verge, to remind people of its existence. Given the need for attention, you’d think think the company might have stuck with the capital letters. But it did, according to design notes, opt for the font Centra No 2 Extrabold – which, of course, screams “I’m relevant!”Another fallen internet giant, AOL, did the same a decade earlier. It shifted to Aol., with the full stop, presumably to suggest that its life was coming to a close. This came at a time when, with the economy in the tank, the guidance in the New York Times was that “bold, block capital letters are out”, in favor of a softer, friendlier lower-case approach. Perhaps it’s a sign of a strong economy, then, that FACEBOOK has turned on caps lock.Meanwhile, unlike media companies such as VICE and POLITICO, FACEBOOK does not appear to be using all caps in its copy – just in images. This is good news for copy editors who would prefer not to help companies rebrand. It’s especially good news for the ’s copy desk, which puts a premium on lowercase – unlike FACEBOOK, we’re not yelling at you.Still, you might wonder whether pasting the new logo on other services is a smart move: why tarnish Instagram and Whatsapp with an enlarged logo of the evil empire? (The services had already been rebranded with a lower-case acknowledgment of their parent company.) Won’t it backfire to remind people that their trusty, end-to-end- encrypted WhatsApp descends from the company that brought us the Cambridge Analytica scandal? Won’t Instagram’s hipness be damaged by a reminder that its boss is King Zuck, Lord of the Nerds?In other words, the company is distancing itself from the hated service it actually created by propping itself up on the beloved social networks it bought. So when foreign powers interfere with the 2020 election, Mark Zuckerberg can tell Congress: sure, Facebook has its problems. But FACEBOOK is doing just fine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/023690b2b7a9b5ecddf8daddfec52e1c0951e495/0_158_4030_2418/master/4030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c516a64845296f38908350814261d465","title":"microsoft japan four day work week productivity","story":"The experiment for the month of August led to more efficient meetings and happier workers who took less time offMicrosoft tested out a four-day work week in its Japan offices and found as a result employees were not only happier – but significantly more productive.For the month of August, Microsoft Japan experimented with a new project called Work-Life Choice Challenge Summer 2019, giving its entire 2,300 person workforce five Fridays off in a row without decreasing pay.Another experiment published by the Harvard Business Review shows shorter work days, a decrease from the average 8-hour work day to a 6-hour work day, increased productivity.

She linked to several videos where teenagers played out key points in history, with special effects and audio to boot.I asked a history expert to watch the videos and comment: my old history teacher, Izzy Jones, who is now vice-principal at my old high school in London.She is delighted to see teenagers use the platform this way. “The ones that I really liked were the ones on the international relations in the 20th century,” says Jones, adding: “I’d use some of those videos in class.”She explains how the most powerful videos use human beings to personify world actors – such as countries – in major historical events.In one video, a TikTok user called @Dontkickphilip personifies the German empire in 1914, aggressively telling Belgium: “I didn’t push you, I moved you out of the way because you wouldn’t move when I asked you to move three times. So I walked through you.” It sums up the military invasion of Belgium by Germany, after Belgium refused Germany passage through the country.In another, a user called @frontierland re-enacts the European expansion into the Americas through a video showing her as a native woman, plaiting her hair and minding her own business. Then all of a sudden, thousands of European settlers are muscling their way in, to the lyrics: “Walking through your neighborhood, spreading all my fleas.”Jones explains that the personification of countries in historical events is helpful in understanding intention and gives a boring textbook subject some personality.Crucially, these videos are providing an interpretation of the past. Both are making an implicit comment on the behavior of those actors.The teens “have used technology really effectively but they’ve also used it appropriately … Sometimes, someone will write an essay which is really lyrical and uses really complex grammar and high-level vocabulary but actually they are talking nonsense. This is not that,” says Jones.The videos are, of course, incomplete – it would be hard to expect more from a 15-second clip. Take a clip by @slaviccaesar, who sums up the American role in the creation of the League of Nations and its retreat from the organization. In the video, she dances towards the camera and then backs away when France and Britain expect the US to join the League.America didn’t just suddenly make a U-turn out of the League of Nations: President Woodrow Wilson met with congressional resistance and his successor, Warren Harding, opposed the organization. But as long as we understand that the videos are just a snapshot of a moment in time, they are effective.“A 15-second video is probably most effective in getting across one key point. Of course it’s not the whole story – but I thought that was a pretty good summation of what happened in 1929 and 1920,” says Jones.She says that the videos are largely historically accurate, but even if they weren’t, they work as a useful historical tool.To make this point, she takes a video about the plague. In it, @youalreadyknowbb portrays the plague as a plot between rats and the plague to kill half of Europe and become superstars in history.If interpreted literally, it doesn’t explain the whole story: if rats were the only reason for the plague, London would be full of plague victims right now. Lack of hospitals and bad hygiene practices were also likely contributors to its spread.But if you taught students about the different factors that contributed to the plague, showed them the video, and then got them to critique it, you would be helping them to understand one of the most important skills in history: how to understand the limitations of any account of a historical event.“Everything you interact with that’s written after an event – whether it’s five minutes after or 500 years after the event – is an interpretation of the past. This is a great way to help people appreciate that,” says Jones.She says that if the students were in her history class, they would be getting an A+ for their history TikToks.Asked how she’d feel if she found out this is what her students were getting up to while her head was turned, she says: “I would be absolutely ecstatic. There are few things that would excite me more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e2cf66f9ba06d2ede789f0962f6c094f7f9bb19/259_131_2318_1390/master/2318.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e44eb23f219824b202ee8a00d38eaa2e","title":"jennifer aniston a lot of guys are narcissists they think every woman wants to sleep with them","story":"Witherspoon and Aniston are sharing a screen for the first time since Friends. They talk disturbing cover-ups and their decades-long fight against sexual harassment“What a wonderful sweater!” gasps Reese Witherspoon, pointing at my old green jumper.“Wait, I’m sorry, look at those cool shoes,” adds Jennifer Aniston, with a comedy emphasis that verges on Chandler Bing-esque, and all eyes turn to my muddy, five-year-old trainers.“And the bag, oh my gosh,” Witherspoon continues appraising my outfit.Neither of them mentions my trousers, so I make a mental note to burn them when I get home.The three of us are meeting in a central London hotel and although outside it is dark and rainy, the two of them, in little black dresses and black high heels, are as golden and glossy as a pair of show ponies on a summer’s day. I, on the other hand, have rain-soaked hair and at least one surplus stone in post-partum weight. But Aniston and Witherspoon will not be swayed from their lovebombing (“I love the !” – Witherspoon).It is a supremely girly way of easing into an interview, engaging in the female lingua franca of insistently complimenting another woman. If it weren’t for the fact there are three PRs in the room with us – one next to Aniston, two next to Witherspoon – I could almost believe that we were just three gals, hanging out for giggles on a Friday afternoon.The actual reason we are hanging out today is to discuss Aniston and Witherspoon’s extremely shiny new television series, The Morning Show, in which they both star, and produce – it’s very much the showpiece of the new streaming service, Apple TV+. It is the first time the women have worked together since playing sisters on Friends, and, as all the press releases excitedly emphasise, it is the first TV show Aniston has committed to since the sitcom that made her a star. The two women have stayed friends since playing Rachel and Jill Greene – “Jen throws an amazing Christmas party!” “I do love entertaining!” “And you’re so good at it, you need to teach me!” – and stress keenly that they are hands on “from top to bottom, from script, to casting, to the tone” of The Morning Show.“It’s a great partnership because I’m a morning person and she’s a night person,” says Witherspoon.“We literally share the responsibility together, and there’s something so refreshing about that,” finishes Witherspoon.Watching and listening to them talk gives a sense of their working dynamic. Witherspoon takes the conversational lead, Aniston gamely backs her up, Witherspoon makes the concluding statement. Bish bash done.Both women are experienced producers with their own production companies. I’ve met many male producers and Aniston and Witherspoon definitely have a less macho, more personable energy than, say, Jerry Bruckheimer, and let’s not even mention the Weinstein brothers (at least, not yet).Why it’s necessary for these power structures to change, and how that started to happen, is precisely what The Morning Show is about. The series was originally envisioned as a TV drama about breakfast TV, but just as they were starting to work on it in 2017, Matt Lauer, the much-loved presenter of NBC’s hugely popular breakfast programme, Today, was accused of sexual misconduct. Instead of dumping their planned programme, Aniston and Witherspoon helped to rejig the story. It now opens with the male newscaster, Mitch (Steve Carell), being accused of sexual harassment, to the horror of his long-term co-host, Alex (Aniston). “So now, instead of dancing around that subject, we were like, OK, episode one – there it is,” says Witherspoon, who plays Bradley, the newscaster brought in to replace Mitch.For two decades, Lauer was one of the biggest television stars in the US. Imagine Phillip Schofield combined with Gary Lineker and Ant and Dec and you have some sense of Lauer’s ubiquity and seemingly clean-cut appeal. Although Carell isn’t explicitly playing Lauer on The Morning Show, he absolutely nails his onscreen all-American-dad charm and the creepy darkness beneath it.The allegations against Lauer were shocking from the start – it was said that he had a button on his desk that enabled him to lock his office door as soon as a woman entered the room – and they have only become more gothic.He has been accused of anal rape and, in his new book, Catch and Kill, the former NBC journalist Ronan Farrow says not only did network management know about Lauer’s behaviour, but they killed Farrow’s investigations into Harvey Weinstein out of fear that the movie producer would retaliate by exposing the truth about Lauer. NBC and Lauer – and Weinstein – deny all allegations against them. When I ask if they have read Farrow’s book, Aniston points to Witherspoon and says, “She has,” in a “she’s the reader” tone of voice.Lauer was not the only US breakfast TV host to be accused of sexual misconduct in 2017: CBS’s Charlie Rose also stepped down after multiple women accused him of harassment. (Rose apologised for his “inappropriate behaviour” but said he did not believe all the allegations made against him were accurate.)Aniston and Witherspoon spoke to Rose’s former colleague Gayle King about what the revelations felt like for her, given they sat next to each other for years.“He was a friend. And they were on air for so long and you didn’t know this about your colleague’s personality,” says Witherspoon.The show isn’t perfect. Aniston is great as the brittle TV anchor seemingly on the verge of losing her mind. But the plot is clunky and the characters’ motivations are so baffling that even they seem confused by them: “Why are you doing this?” “I don’t know!” they shout at one another.Given that the series is ostensibly about the #MeToo movement, its stakes are bewilderingly low: the show’s main concern is whether a wealthy female presenter’s career will suffer because of her male colleague’s behaviour. Is that really the worst thing those involved can imagine happening to a woman – losing a highly paid job?Yet the show deserves credit for touching on some of the ambiguities within the #MeToo movement, such as whether a man sleazing on younger subordinates should be discussed in the same breath as an accused rapist, and how we unpick the complexities of consent when a sexual experience can be interpreted totally differently by the involved parties.“There’s this absolute denial – ‘It was consensual, it was consensual’ – if you’re a narcissist to the degree a lot of these guys are. They think, of course every woman wants to sleep with me,” says Aniston.“This is not an echo chamber of women talking about #MeToo,” says Witherspoon. “It’s actually a very gender-balanced conversation because we need men watching the show. Real change doesn’t happen unless the incumbent power structure accepts it.”That seems a somewhat debatable point – has the patriarchy ever really accepted feminism? – but I want to talk to Witherspoon about her character in particular. One of the key moments in the series is when she realises that almost everyone knew about Mitch and she sets out to expose this culture of corporate silence.In 2017, Witherspoon revealed that she had been sexually assaulted by a director when she was 16, and was instructed by agents and producers to keep quiet about it. “I wish I could tell you that was an isolated incident in my career but, sadly, it wasn’t. I’ve had multiple experiences of harassment and sexual assault,” she said.She felt, she added, “guilt for not speaking up earlier”.How does she think her experiences affected her personally?“It makes me determined not to let this happen to other young women. I’m so grateful to the women who spoke out about things in their past because I’m in a different position, obviously, but those women had nothing to gain, and some lost their jobs over it. They are the real heroes in my mind.”So does she wish she could have spoken out sooner?The temperature in the room drops palpably.“Ummm no. It was a culture of silence and silence was a condition of my employment. That’s what I was told,” she says.I wouldn’t normally press a woman about her experiences of sexual harassment and assault. But given that for the past 20 minutes we have been talking about the importance of talking about sexual assault allegations and cover-ups, and the courage of women who speak up, I am surprised that Witherspoon is shutting down any discussion of her experiences with aphorisms about art.Perhaps I’m asking the wrong questions. I try again: are the people who harassed her or told her to stay silent still working in the entertainment industry?“Ummmmm no,” Witherspoon eventually says. She shoots a frowny-smiley face towards her PRs.“I think we’ll move on now, OK?” one of them says firmly to me.Aniston is looking at me dazed, as if shocked that I’ve broken some code. I feel a little as if I am about to be ejected from the cool girls’ table.But it’s fine. We’re all professionals, so we move on to Harvey Weinstein, a less controversial subject, given that everyone agrees he is Bad. He distributed Witherspoon’s 2002 film The Importance of Being Earnest and produced Aniston’s 2005 film Derailed.“I was never alone in a room with him,” says Aniston.“I was never alone with him either. But I didn’t know why,” adds Witherspoon.“Me neither. But always someone would stand in the room,” Aniston echoes.“Now I look back and I’m very grateful to those people who stayed in the room with me. What they knew, I don’t know,” says Witherspoon.Witherspoon, 43, and Aniston, 50, have been hugely famous for more than half their lives, with the former shooting to fame in the 90s teen film Cruel Intentions when she was 23, and the latter becoming a TV icon at 25 in Friends.Probably the most fun part of The Morning Show is watching Aniston show, through her character, how being in the spotlight can drive a woman to near breaking point. “There is something very interesting about being a public person and playing a public person and incorporating those challenges and bringing them out into the open,” she agrees.Few modern celebrities have been more in the white-hot light of public fascination than Aniston. Ever since the end of her marriage to Brad Pitt in 2005, she has been treated by the media and public as more of a soap opera character than an actual person, one whose life (will she have children? Will she marry again?) we can all follow breathlessly. When she joined Instagram last month, posting a photo of herself and her Friends co-stars, she caused the site to crash. Is she comfortable with the amount of exposure she has?“I find it very odd,” she says, leaning forward earnestly. “I don’t understand it – it doesn’t make sense to me. I’d love for someone to break it down, but there it is and now it has to keep going.”Does it control her life?“No! No, no, no,” she scoffs.She admits she joined Instagram mainly to promote the show.“But also, I think I had this idea … I don’t want to be the only person … Let’s see, what do I want to say here?” she says, with the wariness of one accustomed to having their most casual comments blown up into headlines. “I thought, ‘Why would I do this? People are already in my panty drawers all the time.’“And I want them out of my panty drawers. But now I can decide which pair to show them.”“That’s the best thing you ever said!” hoots Witherspoon.On that note, our time is up.“Thank you for your thoughtful questions,” says Witherspoon, as if thanking me for a kidney.And I leave them fighting for the #MeToo movement, within their limits.The Morning Show is on Apple TV+."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/840d4a9cd327e30c48b228050e30df4aee2ad2a3/488_245_2980_1789/master/2980.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50d7886508bd83a3a3080083e7a9c613","title":"david attenborough the making of a british icon","story":"Patrick Barkham joins Anushka Asthana to chart the rise of one of Britain’s best-loved personalities: the natural history broadcaster David Attenborough.

Others describe an organic – if overexuberant – desire to challenge established historical narratives.“These are actions of a very potent symbolism, in rejecting an official version that has falsified and grossly airbrushed our history,” said Pedro Cayuqueo, a Mapuche writer and historian. “There’s something far deeper going on.”The toppling of statues also reflects deep modern-day grievances felt by the Mapuche, who were absorbed into the Chilean state at gunpoint 150 years ago.Unequal land ownership, deforestation, pollution and limited political representation were entrenched by the brutal 1973-90 Pinochet regime.“We Mapuche have been questioning the economic model and social contract inherited from the dictatorship since the day after the return to democracy,” Cayuqueo added.This discontent regularly spills over into violence. Radical Mapuche groups have firebombed more than 900 targets, often ranches and timber trucks, since 2011, claiming 20 lives.Chile’s militarised police force, have killed about 15 Mapuche since 1990. The fatal police shooting of an unarmed Mapuche farmer named Camilo Catrillanca, a year ago – and the attempted cover-up that followed – provoked widespread, lingering fury.Demonstrators in the capital have carried Catrillanca’s image and waved the Wenufoye, but it is unclear how much the average protester relates to indigenous issues.“The Mapuche flag cannot only be seen as symbol in favour of the Mapuche cause,” said Kenneth Bunker, a Chilean political scientist, “but also as an anti-system emblem.”Working-class Chileans share Mapuche scorn for a distant economic and political elite, but are mainly angered by low wages and pensions, poor public healthcare and high school fees, Bunker added.Still, Mapuche activist groups – who marched together in Temuco last week – are hoping that near-unanimous support for rewriting Chile’s Pinochet-era constitution will provide a window of opportunity.Chief among their objectives is for Chile to become a “plurinational state” like neighbouring Bolivia, granting native peoples greater political autonomy, and their languages and customs official status.Such demands are shared by smaller aboriginal groups like the Diaguita, an Andean desert people with some 90,000 self-identified descendants. Protesters in the northern city of La Serena likewise felled and burned a statue of the conquistador Francisco de Aguirre in late October, replacing it with an image of “Milanka”, a Diaguita woman."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8f0f57eda2d5a71e9f79e47678461cd24923a30/0_50_2222_1334/master/2222.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=084748d2d0dd3fe47c3f50007e42292b","title":"chinas xi jinping expresses high degree of trust in hong kongs carrie lam","story":"Xi says ‘ending violence and chaos’ is priority following pair’s meeting in Shanghai amid speculation over Lam’s future China’s President Xi Jinping has expressed a “high degree of trust” in Hong Kong’s unpopular leader Carrie Lam as the two met after months of increasingly violent protests in the semi-autonomous city.Xi’s show of support followed speculation that Beijing was preparing to remove Lam as city authorities struggle to contain pro-democracy demonstrations that have rocked the financial hub.Their meeting in Shanghai on Monday followed another weekend of violence in Hong Kong that was marked by a knife attack and the vandalising of an office of China’s official Xinhua news agency.Xi said Lam has “done a lot of hard work” and strived to stabilise the situation in Hong Kong, according to a Xinhua report of their meeting.“Xi voiced the central government’s high degree of trust in Lam and full acknowledgement of the work of her and her governance team,” the state news agency said.“Ending violence and chaos and restoring order remain the most important task for Hong Kong at present,” Xi said.Xi also called for “effective efforts” to be made in improving people’s lives and having dialogue with all sectors of society.Willy Lam, a Hong Kong-based expert on Chinese politics, said Beijing is showing support for the city’s chief executive “for the time being”.“It doesn’t mean that they like Carrie Lam, or it doesn’t mean that they think highly of her performance,” he said.“It’s just that if they don’t seem to be supporting her, then it will be impossible for her to carry out her duty in Hong Kong,” Lam said, adding that Beijing wants Hong Kong to enact national security legislation that would give police more power to punish protesters.But Carrie Lam could still be sacked within one year or during Beijing’s annual legislative session in March, the expert said.On Tuesday the Hong Kong government said it deeply regretted the involvement of civil servants in protests that have plunged the Chinese-ruled city into its biggest crisis in decades as activists plan fresh demonstrations across the territory. The acting chief executive Matthew Cheung’s comments came after a commentary by the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily said Hong Kong civil servants who supported the anti-government demonstrations would “perish with the rioters”.In August, thousands of civil servants defied a government warning to remain politically neutral and joined a rally, whileLam said in September she regretted the arrest of some civil servants during protests. China has run the city under a special “one country, two systems” model, which allows Hong Kong liberties not seen on the mainland, since its handover from the British in 1997.A new Hong Kong extradition law is proposed, which would allow people to be transferred to mainland China for a variety of crimes. Residents fear it could lead to politically motivated extraditions into China\u0027s much harsher judicial system.Large public demonstrations start as thousands march in the streets to protest against the extradition bill.Hong Kong lawmakers scuffle in parliament during a row over the law.Hong Kong\u0027s leader, Carrie Lam, introduces concessions to the extradition bill, including limiting the scope of extraditable offences, but critics say they are not enough.The scale of protests continues to increase as more than half a million people take to the streets. Police use rubber bullets and teargas against the biggest protests Hong Kong has seen for decades.Lam says the proposed extradition law has been postponed indefinitely.The protests continue as demonstrators storm the Legislative Council, destroying pictures, daubing graffiti on the walls and flying the old flag of Hong Kong emblazoned with the British union flag. The protests coincide with the 22nd anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong from the UK back to China.Armed men in white T-shirts thought to be supporting the Chinese government attack passengers and passers-by in Yuen Long metro station, while nearby police take no action.44 protesters are charged with rioting, which further antagonises the anti-extradition bill movement.By now the protest movement has coalesced around five key demands: complete withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill, withdrawal of the use of the word riot in relation to the protests, unconditional release of arrested protesters and charges against them dropped, an independent inquiry into police behaviour and the implementation of genuine universal suffrage.The mass protests enter their fifteenth week, with police resorting to teargas and water cannon against the demonstrators, and a wave of doxxing using digital techniques to unmask police and protesters as a new front in the battle.Police shoot a protester with live ammunition for the first time, as demonstrations continue on the day marking the 70th anniversary of the declaration of the People\u0027s Republic of China.The first charges are brought against protesters for covering their faces, after authorities bring in new laws banning face masks in order to make it easier to identify or detain protesters.Hong Kong officials spark outrage in the city as it revealed that nearly a third of protesters arrested since June have been children. Seven hundred and 50 out of the 2,379 people arrested\u0026nbsp were under 18, and 104 were under 16.Lam is forced to deliver a key annual policy speech via video link after after being heckled in parliament, as the legislative council resumed sessions after it was suspended on 12 June. Later in the day one of the protest leaders, Jimmy Sham, was attacked by assailants wielding hammers and knives.Chan Tong-kai, the murder suspect whose case prompted the original extradition bill is released from prison, saying that he is willing to surrender himself to Taiwan. The extradition bill is also formally withdrawn, a key demand of protesters.But public anger has been building for years over fears that Beijing has begun eroding those freedoms, especially since Xi came to power.Protesters have issued a list of demands, including universal suffrage and an investigation into abuses by police.The Chinese Communist Party agreed at a leadership meeting last week to “improve” the way Hong Kong’s chief executive and key officials are appointed and removed, but it provided no other details.The party also warned it would “never tolerate” any challenge to “one country, two systems”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efd62b656d9d216205c01888cf02080b4625fde7/0_101_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f476147f2aa799615bc76b41a1c5b17","title":"iran announces injection of uranium gas into 1044 centrifuges","story":"Latest step away from 2015 nuclear deal piles pressure on EU signatories to counteract crippling US sanctionsIran’s president has announced that Tehran will begin injecting uranium gas into 1,044 centrifuges, in the latest step away from its nuclear deal with world powers since the US president, Donald Trump, withdrew from the accord over a year ago.The development is significant as the centrifuges previously spun empty, without gas injection, under the terms of the landmark 2015 accord known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).It also increases pressure on European nations that remain in the accord, which at this point has all but collapsed.Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, did not clarify in his announcement whether the centrifuges, which are at its nuclear facility in Fordow, would be used to produce enriched uranium.The centrifuges would be injected with the uranium gas as of Wednesday, Rouhani said.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the\u0026nbspJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspended a 12-year deadlock\u0026nbspover Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with\u0026nbspIran\u0026nbspwere in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.His remarks on Iranian state television, came a day after Tehran’s nuclear programme chief said the country had doubled the number of advanced IR-6 centrifuges in operation.There was no immediate reaction from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN nuclear watchdog monitoring Iran’s compliance with the deal.The European Union called on Iran to return to the deal on Monday, while the White House sanctioned members of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s inner circle as part of its maximalist pressure campaign against Tehran.Rouhani stressed the steps taken so far, including going beyond the deal’s enrichment and stockpile limitations, could be reversed if Europe offers a way for it to avoid US sanctions choking off its crude oil sales abroad.“We should be able to sell our oil,” Rouhani said. “We should be able to bring our money” into the country.The centrifuges at Fordow are IR-1s, Iran’s first-generation centrifuge. The nuclear deal allowed those at Fordow to spin without uranium gas, while allowing up to 5,060 at its Natanz facility to enrich uranium.A centrifuge enriches uranium by rapidly spinning uranium hexafluoride gas. An IR-6 centrifuge can produce enriched uranium 10 times faster than an IR-1, Iranian officials say.Iranian scientists also are working on a prototype called the IR-9, which works 50 times faster than the IR-1, Iran’s nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi said.Tehran has gone from producing some 450 grams of low-enriched uranium a day to 5 kg , Salehi said. Iran now holds over 500 kg of low-enriched uranium, he added. The JCPOA had committed Iran to a limit of 300 kg .JCPOA’s collapse coincided with a tense summer of mysterious attacks on oil tankers and Saudi oil facilities that the US blamed on Iran. Tehran denied the allegation, though it did seize oil tankers and shoot down a US military surveillance drone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81a879c4fd2431b90866e39cf80451db89ee4106/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8a248ef6174cbe59113f8ce5e1ccc87","title":"tuesday briefing new order as lindsay hoyle is elected speaker","story":"Chorley MP is 158th to hold the chair … Baghdadi’s sister captured, says Turkey … and damning Trump-Ukraine testimony releasedHello, Warren Murray here to give you a leg-up into the present moment in news.Lindsay Hoyle has been elected Speaker of the House of Commons as successor to John Bercow. The 62-year-old Labour MP for Chorley – the only candidate who refused to say how he voted in the 2016 EU referendum – became the 158th Speaker after beating six others in a secret ballot. The Lancastrian has promised to bring calm to a chamber that has seen isive and bad-tempered debates over Brexit.In keeping with tradition, fellow MPs Caroline Flint and Nigel Evans “dragged” Hoyle to the Speaker’s chair after the result was announced. Historically, the powerful job sometimes led to his predecessors’ deaths on the orders of the monarch of the day.Hoyle will take up the role on Tuesday for a single day before parliament dissolves for a general election on 12 December. The Speaker traditionally severs all ties with their political party and stands in their seat unopposed. First, though, Hoyle is expected to be called upon to allow an urgent question about the government’s failure to publish before the election a report by the intelligence committee on alleged Russian interference in the UK, including in the 2016 referendum campaign, and how to safeguard against it. The government has claimed the report needs more time to be signed off – however the committee denies this, and it is understood the dossier has already been approved by the intelligence agencies under a process going as far back as March. Downing Street received a final draft nearly three weeks ago.‘Shock’ at smear plot against Biden – Testimony has been released by congressional investigators of two senior American diplomats who spoke about a White House plot to conjure political dirt on Joe Biden in Ukraine. P Michael McKinley, a former ambassador, returned to service at the request of Mike Pompeo, Trump’s secretary of state, but resigned in shock at efforts inside the department to manufacture dirt on Trump’s political opponent. “And if I can underscore, in 37 years in the foreign service and … working 10 years back in Washington, I had never seen that,” McKinley testified. Marie Yovanovitch, who was removed by the Trump administration from her post as ambassador to Ukraine, told investigators she felt “shocked” when she found out that Trump had said of her to Ukraine’s president: “She’s going to go through some things.” “I was very concerned,” said Yovanovitch. “I still am.” “Did you feel threatened?” she was asked. “Yes,” she replied. Seeking advice on how to staunch attacks from Trump’s emissary Rudy Giuliani, she was told to tweet something nice about the president.Drone pilots will need licence – Drone users in the UK must now sit an online test and pay a £9 annual fee or face a £1,000 fine. Drones weighing more than 250g – basically, all but the smallest toys – must be registered and marked with a unique licence number. The government announced the register in 2017 in response to growing concern over drone use, from smuggling drugs into prisons to disrupting airports. The plan predated the closure of Gatwick airport in December 2018 when a drone was repeatedly flown near the runway. Owners are obliged to identify and label all drones by 30 November and operators must pass a test about legal and safe usage before they can fly them. The Civil Aviation Authority estimates 130,000 people will have to pay and register by the end of the month. The CAA is launching an accompanying “drones reunited” site to track down owners of wayward drones and return them.Baghdadi family rounded up – Turkey claims to have captured the sister of killed Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and is interrogating her along with her husband and daughter-in-law, who were also detained. A senior Turkish official said Rasmiya Awad, 65, was seized on Monday during a raid near the Turkish-controlled northern Syrian town of Azaz. When captured she was accompanied by five children. “We hope to gather a trove of intelligence from Baghdadi’s sister on the inner workings of Isis,” the official said. Baghdadi blew himself up, along with two children, when cornered in a tunnel by US special forces in north-western Syria.Parents’ drinking marks children – More than a third of children in the UK are negatively affected by their parents’ alcohol use, research has suggested. Children surveyed – who were aged between 10 and 17 – reported negative experiences including being given less attention than usual, being put to bed earlier or later than the usual time, arguing with parents, and being at the receiving end of unpredictability. Children were more than twice as likely to report a negative outcome if their parents had negative motives for drinking, such as coping with depression or to escape other problems. Ian Hamilton, an expert in addiction and mental health from the University of York, said: “With cutbacks to mental health services, alcohol may be the only way that some people feel they can cope with their feelings and they may be oblivious to the impact it has on those around them.”Run it past me again – Any amount of running can reduce your risk of early death, according to researchers, who say their findings push back against previous suggestions that health benefits might be lessened for people who run a lot. In the latest study, significant benefits were seen even among those running once a week or less, less than 50 minutes a week, or at 6mph or less. There was no bigger reduction in the risk of early death at greater levels of running. According to the World Health Organization, about 3.2 million deaths each year are down to people not doing enough physical activity.In June 2018 the ’s health editor, Sarah Boseley, wrote about child labour in the tobacco fields of Malawi.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw The Taoiseach needs to “urgently clarify” recent comments he made about the “benefits” of climate change, An Taisce has said.The environmental organisation has said Mr Varadkar’s “extraordinary remarks” about climate change will “undoubtedly be seized upon by climate deniers and delayers” both nationally and around the world.Speaking at the launch of the first progress report on the Climate Action Plan last week, Mr Varadkar said: “It’s interesting to see that there can be pluses and minuses as well, like actually one thing that we definitely face as a result of climate change is warmer winters, we’re already experiencing warmer winters, and that actually means using less energy, because it’s warmer. And people use less heating and also that means fewer deaths as a result of cold weather.“A big problem that we have is winter-related illnesses, and people dying because of very cold winters, but then on the down side of things, you know hotter summers, people dying because of hypothermia, exposure to UV rays, but it’s interesting when you do look at those things that there is ledger and there are benefits and there are downsides, the downsides outweigh the benefits but we need to be aware of them too.”Widespread criticismMr Varadkar’s comments, which were first reported in The Sunday Business Post, have been met with widespread criticism in recent days.An Taisce said for the Taoiseach to be talking “in terms of a ‘ledger’ where there are more or less equal benefits and downsides to climate breakdown betrays a reckless disregard for science”.“We very much doubt our Taoiseach, a medical doctor, would feel there are ‘two sides to the ledger’ about the health effects of smoking. Similarly, it is unlikely he believes we should allow anti-vaccine activists to claim ‘two sides to the ledger’ of the benefits of mass vaccination,” a statement from An Taisce said.“Complacency and baseless optimism are no substitute for real, measurable climate actions in line with the best scientific advice. The era of dithering and delay has long passed. Mr Varadkar and his advisors need to get real before climate change damages far more than just our international reputation,” it added."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Taoiseach showed \u0026lsquoreckless disregard for science\u0026rsquo by talking of climate change benefitsPerson involved in theft of high-end vehicles and machinery across IrelandIf successful move could see up to 50 stalled Opposition Bills back on the agendaNotice reissued for greater Dublin area on Monday nightGarda\u0026iacute believe incident in Bettystown linked to Drogheda feudPolice yet to take witness statement from Monaghan-based Global Trailer RentalsEnglish national found dead in west Cork two years ago after assaultOver 70 feud-related incidents have occurred in greater Drogheda area, according to garda\u0026iacuteDetectives conduct house-to-house inquiries in attempt to piece together last movementsNew law would allow release of birth information to adopted people for the first timeHouses of the Oireachtas Commission ponders request to address concerns on issueBoy sentenced to 11 years had inflicted 10cm wound on Stephanie Ng\u0026rsquos neckNew TG4 documentary examines how men were subjected to \u0026lsquofive techniques\u0026rsquo method of interrogationDepartment of Justice asked to amend its plan to place 130 people in one locationPotatoes, carrots, parsnips, winter wheat and barley all under threat from heavy rainIrish Water says heavy rainfall has caused contamination at Leixlip treatment plant"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4073011.1572950494!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin boil water notice remains in place for 600 000 people","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere were low stocks of water in Supervalu Castleknock due to the Boil Water notice issued in the greater Dublin Area by Irish Water last month. Photograph: Alan BetsonA boil water notice remains in place for 600,000 people in the greater Dublin area on Tuesday.The notice was reimposed on Monday night, less than a fortnight after the last one was lifted.Those in the affected areas, which includes Fingal, most of north Dublin, south Dublin, Kildare and Dunboyne, Co Meath, can only use boiled or bottled water for drinking and in food preparation.Irish Water and Fingal County Council have blamed the latest precaution on heavy rain and “turbidity” or cloudy water due to suspended particles, in the source water for the Leixlip plant, which exceeded acceptable levels.“Plant operators reacted quickly before alarms were activated and shut down the old plant to stop this water entering the network. There were no issues at the new plant, where the level of turbidity was managed by the newer technology on site,” the utility said in a statement.“It was essential to restart production at the old plant, which produces 20 per cent of drinking water for Dublin, otherwise significant restrictions and outages would be inevitable. As Irish Water cannot guarantee the quality of water from the old plant, a boil water notice is now in place.”Niall Gleeson, managing director of Irish Water has described the company’s efforts to refurbish the old Leixlip water plant as being like “trying to change the tyres on a car while it is still heading down the road”.Local authoritiesEamon Gallen, Irish Water’s general manager, said he did not know how long this boil notice will last for.“We are working with Fingal and we will work in consultation with the HSE and the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) to get the boil notice lifted as quickly and as safely as possible. We have to agree criteria with them to lift the notice which we expect will be along the same time lines as last time,” he told Newstalk Breakfast.“We are also working with the other local authorities to get as much water as possible from other sources.“We produce 1.7 billion litres of water every day and that water is all fit to consume or we’ll tell you it’s not. So we will come out quickly and tell you. I know it’s cold comfort to people who have to boil water today.”Mr Gallen explained that Irish Water is trying to accelerate the refurbishment of old Leixlip plant. “When you take the filters out of operation that impacts on supply, we also have a chlorine upgrade programme under way and as per the EPA report, we are considering UVA treatment, but we have to see if the filters need to be refurbished before any of that could be effective,” he added.“There’s no doubt that the water network needs a lot of investment, but we have the strategic funding plan approved by government and we believe that is sufficient for us to do the water that’s tasked for us. It is a long-term programme of works. It will take decades to get the water network back up to standard.”Irish Water is due before the Oireachtas housing committee on Tuesday.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Story of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.

The tradition dates back to a time when the speaker may have been killed by the monarch when relaying the decisions made by parliament.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNewly-elected Speaker of the House of Commons Lindsay Hoyle. Photograph: PRUAFP via Getty ImagesBritish MPs elected Labour’s Lindsay Hoyle as Speaker on Monday to take on the role of refereeing the next parliamentary instalment of the protracted struggle over Brexit.In the three years since Britain voted to leave the European Union, the Speaker has played an increasingly influential role in the process of parliamentarians debating the rights and wrongs of Brexit and passing the laws needed to implement it.The Speaker is the arbiter of procedural disputes in the House of Commons, parliament’s lower chamber, and has the power to decide which challenges to the Conservative government’s plans are allowed to proceed.Former Speaker John Bercow, who stood down last week after 10 years, was accused of breaking convention and favouring those who wanted to stop the government’s exit plans. But he was feted by others who saw him as empowering them to challenge and scrutinise the executive.“I will be neutral, I will be transparent,” Mr Hoyle (62) said after his colleagues carried out the parliamentary tradition of dragging him to the speaker’s chair.Parliament had to make sure the “tarnish is polished away”, he said, adding: “This House will change but it will change for the better.”Foremost among those challenges will be Brexit, but the Speaker will also have to handle criticism that parliament’s antiquated setup has allowed bullying and harassment.“I believe you will also bring your signature kindness and reasonableness to our proceedings and thereby help to bring us together as a parliament and a democracy,” prime minister Boris Johnson said after Mr Hoyle’s election.Mr Hoyle, who has been deputy speaker since 2010, was elected after four rounds of secret ballots in a process which took several hours. He beat fellow Labour lawmaker Chris Bryant in the final round by 325 votes to 213.Since 2017, the ruling Conservative Party has not had a majority in parliament, giving rivals more freedom to challenge the government and the Speaker a big say in the process.But with a general election coming on Deccember 12th, the new Speaker’s first job will depend on what government the public elect.“Some of the decisions that John Bercow has made in the chair have been quite unprecedented. They’ve been very unexpected. Some MPs (Members of Parliament) have loved them. Some MPs have loathed them,” said Alice Lilly, senior researcher at the Institute for Government think tank.“We’ll have to wait and see whether the new Speaker faces similar conditions with Brexit and minority government. If we have a majority government, it might be that actually Commons procedure becomes a little bit less crucial.” –  News and Service"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons november 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.General Election latest news: Michael Gove calls Labour’s promise to ‘get Brexit sorted’ a ‘fairytale’General Election 2019 poll tracker: Lead for Boris Johnson as campaign beginsChildren who get a drone for Christmas will need to take theory test before flying itSpain’s hard-Right surge as populists take advantage of Catalonia crisisChina\u0026#39s Xi Jinping expresses \u0026#39high degree of trust\u0026#39 in Hong Kong\u0026#39s Carrie LamComment: Jeremy Corbyn will never convince the British people he can get Brexit sortedIran breaches nuclear deal by restarting centrifuges at underground Fordow facilityAnti-Brexit parties in Northern Ireland strike electoral pact to oust key DUP figuresWill Donald Trump be impeached?

However the island was previously used as a German military base during the Second World War.Created with Sketch.30 times things went wrong on film and TV sets Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Margot Robbie – The Wolf of Wall StreetThe actor says that acting in the scene where she has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed of money was really painful in The Wolf of Wall Street. “I got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.”During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn’t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.330 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren – Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia film. It didn’t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine’s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in. Oh, my God, it’s in.” “She got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,” Mintz-Plasse said. “Afterwards we didn\u0027t talk about it we still don\u0027t speak about that moment.”2330 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone – The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. “Ok. Let it be known, I didn’t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won’t take it off. I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was “messing around” between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant’s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. “I was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes – you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).”The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting “Hey Malkovich, think fast!” Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.3030 The entire cast of RoarBut whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall’s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.130 Margot Robbie – The Wolf of Wall StreetThe actor says that acting in the scene where she has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed of money was really painful in The Wolf of Wall Street. “I got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.”During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn’t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.330 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren – Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia film. It didn’t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine’s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in. Oh, my God, it’s in.” “She got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,” Mintz-Plasse said. “Afterwards we didn\u0027t talk about it we still don\u0027t speak about that moment.”2330 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone – The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. “Ok. Let it be known, I didn’t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won’t take it off. I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position.

suggests.Only a third of 1,000 small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) surveyed by distribution company CitySprint said they had seen the government’s “Get Ready For Brexit” advertising campaign.One in five said they had not seen or accessed any government guidance or support since 2016, raising questions about how well prepared smaller businesses are, according to the report.Almost half of those polled said they do not believe the government has done enough to help businesses prepare for Brexit.Despite the findings, half of SMEs said they felt more confident than they did 12 months ago, and were looking to expand their customer base across the UK in the next year.Created with Sketch.Best pictures from Final Say Brexit march Show all 76Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with

plans to prepare for Brexit, and just under three in 10 have put plans in place specifically for a no-deal scenario. Almost a quarter (22 per cent) have specific plans which prepare them for a Brexit extension.Rosie Bailey of CitySprint, said: “SMEs sit right at the heart of our economy. While it’s great to see that they feel upbeat and resilient, thanks to many years spent flexing their business to suit the times, it’s clear that they also need some extra support to help navigate the specific complexities of Brexit.“With time running out, business owners should take immediate steps to seek out the information they need to understand the potential impact of Brexit in whatever form it takes and put clear plans in place to help their organisation mitigate these.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

suggests.Only a third of 1,000 small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) surveyed by distribution company CitySprint said they had seen the government’s “Get Ready For Brexit” advertising campaign.One in five said they had not seen or accessed any government guidance or support since 2016, raising questions about how well prepared smaller businesses are, according to the report.Almost half of those polled said they do not believe the government has done enough to help businesses prepare for Brexit.Despite the findings, half of SMEs said they felt more confident than they did 12 months ago, and were looking to expand their customer base across the UK in the next year.Created with Sketch.Best pictures from Final Say Brexit march Show all 76Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with

plans to prepare for Brexit, and just under three in 10 have put plans in place specifically for a no-deal scenario. Almost a quarter (22 per cent) have specific plans which prepare them for a Brexit extension.Rosie Bailey of CitySprint, said: “SMEs sit right at the heart of our economy. While it’s great to see that they feel upbeat and resilient, thanks to many years spent flexing their business to suit the times, it’s clear that they also need some extra support to help navigate the specific complexities of Brexit.“With time running out, business owners should take immediate steps to seek out the information they need to understand the potential impact of Brexit in whatever form it takes and put clear plans in place to help their organisation mitigate these.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

around 11.6 million barrels per day, worth $719m at today’s market price.\u0026nbspThat volume of oil has made\u0026nbspAramco responsible for more global emissions than any other company in history by a comfortable margin, according to the Climate Accountability Network.Created with Sketch.Attack on major oil facilities in Saudi Arabia: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Smoke billows from multiple fires at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberThick black smoke billows from a fire following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaThe Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia prior to the drone strikes on 14 September Damage is seen to the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Smoke billows from multiple fires following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaSmoke rises from a fire following a drone strike at the Aramco facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberSmoke is seen following a fire at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberSmoke billows from multiple fires at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberThick black smoke billows from a fire following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaThe Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia prior to the drone strikes on 14 September Damage is seen to the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Smoke billows from multiple fires following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaSmoke rises from a fire following a drone strike at the Aramco facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberSmoke is seen following a fire at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberIt also presents the significant risk of so-called stranded assets such as oil fields and refineries which are highly valued today but may quickly become worthless as the world’s energy needs switch away from fossil fuels.\u0026nbspYasir al-Rumayyan, the chairman of Saudi Aramco, said on Sunday: “Today marks a significant milestone in the history of the company and important progress towards delivering Saudi Vision 2030, the kingdom’s blueprint for sustained economic ersification and growth.”The sale will be a publicity coup and a financial boost for Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Mohammad bin Salman, who is attempting to present a more modern vision for the conservative kingdom while decreasing its reliance on oil.Saudi Arabia hopes to raise around $40-$45bn from the sale of a 1 per cent to 2 per cent stake. Much of the cash is likely to flow into the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which has bought stakes in a host of companies including Uber.\u0026nbspBanks and advisors will also collect hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for their role in getting the Aramco share sale over the line.The shares will debut on Saudia Arabia’s stock market, the Tadawul, dashing hopes on Wall Street and in the City of London, which had been vying to win a share of the lucrative listing.Plans for a dual listing have been put on hold but may be revived in future.\u0026nbspThe importance of Aramco to world oil supplies was underlined in September when drone attacks on its oil plants sent the oil prices soaring.A temporary shutdown at the Abqaiq and Khurais plants after the attacks temporarily took out more than 5 per cent of global oil production.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Instead, it is intended to distinguish the parent company from all of those apps, and stress that Facebook owns a variety of different products.Users may not know that some apps – such as Instagram or cryptocurrency platform Calibra – are actually made by Facebook, the company suggested, and the new branding should help change that.People should know which companies make the products they use. Our main services include the Facebook app, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, Workplace, Portal and Calibra, wrote\u0026nbspAntonio Lucio, chief marketing officer, in a blog post.These apps and technologies have shared infrastructure for years and the teams behind them frequently work together.The new logo could also have the effect of distancing Facebook the company from its controversial app and website, which have been dragged into a variety of different privacy scandals in recent times.It will start rolling out in different ways in the future, Facebook said.

Since then it has been moving away from Earth, and almost exactly a year ago it passed out of the sun’s protective bubble and into interstellar space.When it did, it became only the second\u0026nbspman-made object to travel outside the limits of our sun’s influence and into the “interstellar medium”. Its sibling Voyager 1 did so six years earlier, because it is on a different trajectory and moving faster.Scientists have now revealed what they learnt from that mission out into the furthest reaches

SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberAccording to the scientists, this jump was detected by one of the instruments on Voyager 2 and is evidence of the probe making its way “from the hot, lower density plasma characteristic of the solar wind to the cool, higher-density plasma of interstellar space”.It is also similar to the plasma density jump experienced by Voyager 1 when it crossed into interstellar space, the researchers added.Nasa’s pioneering Voyager 2 has left the Solar SystemAmong many things, the astronomers are looking to gain a better understanding of how the solar winds – the stream of charge particles coming out of the sun – interact with the interstellar winds – made up of particles from other stars.Dr Edward Stone, a professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology and former director of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said: “We are trying to understand the nature of the boundary where these two winds collide.”The astronomers believe the probes’ journeys – with their different mission goals and trajectories – give “valuable clues” about the structure of the heliosphere – a vast bubble encompassing the sun and the solar system.Bill\u0026nbspKurth, a research scientist at the University of Iowa and one of the authors of the studies, said: “It implies that the heliosphere is symmetric, at least at the two points where the Voyager spacecraft crossed.”In one of the papers, the researchers suggest that the interstellar medium near the\u0026nbspheliopause\u0026nbsp- the boundary where the sun’s solar winds are\u0026nbspstopped by the interstellar medium – is hotter than expected, with a temperature of around 29,000-49,000C.In another study, a different team reported the presence of layers “on both sides of the\u0026nbspheliopause”.While scientists were aware of the inner layer, the presence of the outer layer became evident only after Voyager 2 crossed into interstellar space.The researchers said evidence gathered by both probes show that the interstellar medium, along with the\u0026nbspheliopause\u0026nbspand the interstellar magnetic fields, “form a complex interconnected dynamical system”.The Voyagers were sent initially to study the outer planets including Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, but then just kept on going.Even though they made it out of the sun’s bubble, astronomers maintain that the Voyagers are still technically in the solar system because it stretches to the outer edge of the\u0026nbspOort\u0026nbspcloud – comprising water ice, ammonia and methane – which surrounds the sun.Dr Stone said the crafts’ plutonium power sources will eventually stop supplying electricity, at which point their instruments and their transmitters will die.He added: “In another five years or so we may not have enough scientific instruments to power it any longer.”Dr\u0026nbspKurth\u0026nbspbelieves that both Voyagers “will outlast Earth”, adding: “They’re in their own orbits around the galaxy for five billion years or longer. And the probability of them running into anything is almost zero.”Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

around 11.6 million barrels per day, worth $719m at today’s market price.\u0026nbspThat volume of oil has made\u0026nbspAramco responsible for more global emissions than any other company in history by a comfortable margin, according to the Climate Accountability Network.Created with Sketch.Attack on major oil facilities in Saudi Arabia: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Smoke billows from multiple fires at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberThick black smoke billows from a fire following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaThe Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia prior to the drone strikes on 14 September Damage is seen to the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Smoke billows from multiple fires following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaSmoke rises from a fire following a drone strike at the Aramco facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberSmoke is seen following a fire at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberSmoke billows from multiple fires at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberThick black smoke billows from a fire following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaThe Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia prior to the drone strikes on 14 September Damage is seen to the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Smoke billows from multiple fires following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaSmoke rises from a fire following a drone strike at the Aramco facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberSmoke is seen following a fire at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberIt also presents the significant risk of so-called stranded assets such as oil fields and refineries which are highly valued today but may quickly become worthless as the world’s energy needs switch away from fossil fuels.\u0026nbspYasir al-Rumayyan, the chairman of Saudi Aramco, said on Sunday: “Today marks a significant milestone in the history of the company and important progress towards delivering Saudi Vision 2030, the kingdom’s blueprint for sustained economic ersification and growth.”The sale will be a publicity coup and a financial boost for Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Mohammad bin Salman, who is attempting to present a more modern vision for the conservative kingdom while decreasing its reliance on oil.Saudi Arabia hopes to raise around $40-$45bn from the sale of a 1 per cent to 2 per cent stake. Much of the cash is likely to flow into the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which has bought stakes in a host of companies including Uber.\u0026nbspBanks and advisors will also collect hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for their role in getting the Aramco share sale over the line.The shares will debut on Saudia Arabia’s stock market, the Tadawul, dashing hopes on Wall Street and in the City of London, which had been vying to win a share of the lucrative listing.Plans for a dual listing have been put on hold but may be revived in future.\u0026nbspThe importance of Aramco to world oil supplies was underlined in September when drone attacks on its oil plants sent the oil prices soaring.A temporary shutdown at the Abqaiq and Khurais plants after the attacks temporarily took out more than 5 per cent of global oil production.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the colony the researchers found was unusual, as it was composed entirely of worker ants and had no obvious available food source.Now, scientists from the Museum and Institute of Zoology at\u0026nbspthe Polish Academy of Sciences, in Warsaw, have deduced that the thriving community was sustained by cannibalism, and that the ants in the bunker were an accidental offshoot of a larger colony living at ground level near small ventilation pipes leading into the subterranean bunker.When they were first found, the scientists estimated the presence of close to a million inidual ants.\u0026nbspThe insects ended up in this situation as a result of large numbers accidentally falling down the ventilation pipe and being unable to climb back up to their nest.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Insects at risk of extinction Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Wasps are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskDragonflies are of the order Odonata, one of the most at riskBees are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskButterflies are of the order Lepidoptera, one of the most at risk Ants are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskCaddisflies make up the order Trichoptera, one of the most at riskStoneflies are of the order plecoptera, one of the most at risk Saw-Flies are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskMoths are of the order Lepidoptera, one of the most at risk Damselflies are of the order Odonata, one of the most at riskMayflies are of the order Ephemeroptera, one of the most at risk Wasps are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskDragonflies are of the order Odonata, one of the most at riskBees are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskButterflies are of the order Lepidoptera, one of the most at risk Ants are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskCaddisflies make up the order Trichoptera, one of the most at riskStoneflies are of the order plecoptera, one of the most at risk Saw-Flies are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskMoths are of the order Lepidoptera, one of the most at risk Damselflies are of the order Odonata, one of the most at riskMayflies are of the order Ephemeroptera, one of the most at risk Several years later, the ants in the bunker still appeared to be thriving, prompting an investigation into how this was possible.In a newly published paper, Professor Wojciech Czechowski and Dr István Maák said their investigations revealed the wood ants were consuming the dead bodies of their fallen comrades that were accumulating on the bunker floor.\u0026nbspIn nature, a similar behaviour occurs frequently during spring, when protein food is scarce.\u0026nbspNeighbouring colonies\u0026nbspengage in so-called “ant wars”, which set territorial boundaries and also provide food in the form of the fresh corpses.Woman bitten by mystery insect has legs and fingertips amputated Pentagon ordered to reveal whether it used ticks as biological weaponsBritain is not immune to the ‘insect armageddon’Recent research has also shown that corpse consumption among wood ants is more common than previously thought, and that even the corpses of their nest-mates can serve as an important food source – and not only in periods of food shortage.“Here we show that the ‘colony’ in the bunker survived and grew thanks to an influx of workers from the source nest above the bunker and mass consumption of corpses of the imprisoned nest-mates,” the authors said.In 2016, the scientists experimented with creating a bridge for the ants to allow them to return to the original colony. At first they allowed a hundred iniduals to regain access to the nest, where they saw they were accepted as belonging to the larger, original colony.After this success they made the bridge permanent, and more recent visits to the bunker have revealed very small numbers of ants still living down there, with the vast majority believed to have returned to the original nest.The research is published in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I go to bed at night wishing I never wake up in the morning,’ says food-bank userFood-bank users have on average just £7.10 a day to live on, according to a new report revealing the extent to which\u0026nbsppoverty and changes\u0026nbspin the welfare system are\u0026nbspaffecting thousands of households across the UK.Research commissioned by the Trussell Trust, Britain’s largest food bank provider, reveals\u0026nbspthe median weekly income after housing costs for households relying on food parcels was £50 in late 2018, “drastically lower” than the official relative poverty threshold of £262 per week.The findings, in the first annual report of a three-year long research project, suggest that\u0026nbsppeople are being forced to appeal for food parcels for three main reasons: problems with the benefits system\u0026nbspill health and challenging life experiences\u0026nbspand a lack of local support.Food-bank use\u0026nbspsoared to record levels\u0026nbsplast year, with\u0026nbsp1,583,668 three-day emergency food supplies\u0026nbspdistributed in the 12 months to March 2019 – a 19 per cent rise on the previous year – with more than half a million of these (577,618) going to children.The new report finds that food-bank users often rely\u0026nbspon benefits, with two-thirds reporting problems with the welfare system, including a reduction in the value of benefit payments, being refused\u0026nbspdisability benefits, sanctions, and delays in payments like the five-week wait for universal credit.Teachers are living in sheds, cars and using food banks, charity saysFood banks are no longer serving just the homelessUniversal credit ‘forcing people to turn to food banks to survive’Food bank use among children surges by a fifth in a year, figures showThe research also shows that the majority of people referred to food banks\u0026nbsphave\u0026nbspexperienced a challenging life event, such as an eviction or household breakdown – which often increase living costs and make it harder to maintain paid work or to successfully claim benefits – in the year prior to using the food bank.Almost three in four food-bank users have a health issue or live with someone who does, with more than half of these relating to mental health\u0026nbspand a quarter being long-term physical conditions – which can\u0026nbspincrease\u0026nbspliving costs and\u0026nbspbe a barrier to doing paid work.The findings also show that particular groups of people were more likely to need a food bank, such as single mothers, with 22 per cent of people at food banks being single parents, the majority of whom\u0026nbspare women.One food-bank user, named only as Amanda in the report, told researchers £130 of her £138 fortnightly benefit payment for a health condition went to paying arrears, leaving her with only £8 to live on.“If I don’t pay my bills, then I’ll get the house taken off me. After paying arrears, I’ve got £8 a fortnight and that’s to pay for gas, electric, water,” she said. “So it’s just impossible, it really is. I go to bed at night wishing I never wake up in the morning.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

People are trying to get by on £50 a week and that’s just not enough for the essentials, let alone a decent standard of living,“ said Ms Revie.“We created a benefits system because we’re a country that believes in making sure financial support is there for each other if it’s needed. The question that naturally arises, then, is why the incomes of people at food banks are so low, despite being supported by that benefits system?”Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood echoed the remarks, saying there was “no clearer sign of the impact of years of harsh, punitive Conservative policies than the ever increasing numbers of people forced to turn to food banks to survive”. \u0026nbspShe pledged that Labour would scrap universal credit, abolish the benefit cap and end the five-week wait to ensure that the social security system protects people from poverty.Faye Goldman, director at the charity Gingerbread, said it was “shocking” that 22 per cent of food-bank users in 2019 were single parents, adding: “The government needs to wake up and realise the true impact of a benefits system that isn’t providing a safety net for those who need it.Rees-Mogg: The growing use of food banks in the UK is “rather uplifting”“It simply isn’t right that single parents, most of whom are working, are being forced into poverty with little hope of escape.”A DWP spokesperson said: “We take this report very seriously and continue to work closely with the Trussell Trust on this important issue. We spend more than £95bn a year on the welfare safety net, but we continue to make improvements to get people the support they need and prevent them falling through the cracks.“Already we have simplified the benefits system with universal credit, making it easier for people to access support. And this week we have announced working-age benefits will rise in line with inflation from April, giving millions of people more money in their pockets.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailShadow housing secretary John Healey said the starter home scheme had been a “total failure”, adding: “It’s clear you can’t trust the Tories to do what they promise.“Conservative ministers pledged in 2015 to build 200,000 cut-price homes for first-time buyers, but the NAO confirms they haven’t built a single one, despite wasting four years and spending millions of pounds.“After nearly 10 years of Conservative failure on housing, the country needs a Labour Government to fix the housing crisis.”Row over \u0027affordable\u0027 starter homes that will cost up to £450,000Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: “Starter Homes are plainly a non-starter. But the reason hundreds of thousands of people are having to choose between food and rent isn’t because of the government’s failure on Starter Homes, it’s because we haven’t built the social homes we desperately need.She cited new research by the charity, published on the same day as the NAO report, showing that more than nine in 10 private renters (91 per cent) who need a social home are unable to get one and are left on waiting lists, often for years on end.\u0026nbspThe charity’s analysis of the latest government data shows there were nearly 500,000 privately renting households on council waiting lists last year, but fewer than 43,000 private renters moved into a social rent home during that same period.\u0026nbspMs Neate added: “Social housing is what all political parties must focus on if we’re going to have any hope of solving the housing emergency. A commitment to build at least 90,000 social homes a year over the next parliament is their best shot at turning failure into success.”An MHCLG spokesperson said: “We are committed to building more homes and supporting people into home ownership. We have a great track record and housebuilding is at its highest level for all but one of the last 30 years – with 222,000 homes delivered last year, and 1.3m in total since 2010, including over 430,000 affordable homes.“The number of first-time buyers is currently at an 11-year annual high, and over 560,000 households have been helped into home ownership through government schemes like help to buy and right to buy.”PA contributed to this reportShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This means it is unlikely to be published before Tuesday, when parliament rises, and therefore\u0026nbspnot until the after election on 12\u0026nbspDecember.The government’s arguments have been dismissed by a number of senior former public officials including former cabinet secretary Lord Butler,\u0026nbspLord Ricketts, former national security advisor and chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee,\u0026nbspand Lord Anderson, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation.Created with Sketch.Top 10 marginal seats to watch at the general election Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 2Currently held by Labour with a majority of 20310 Perth and North PerthshireCurrently held by the SNP with a majority of 21Currently held by independent, formerly Labour, MP Ian Austin with a majority of 22Currently held by Labour with a majority of 30Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 31Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 45810 Crewe and NantwichCurrently held by Labour with a majority of 48Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 60Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 75Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 2Currently held by Labour with a majority of 20310 Perth and North PerthshireCurrently held by the SNP with a majority of 21Currently held by independent, formerly Labour, MP Ian Austin with a majority of 22Currently held by Labour with a majority of 30Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 31Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 45810 Crewe and NantwichCurrently held by Labour with a majority of 48Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 60Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 75Security and intelligence service officials say they are in the dark over why the report has not been published.One told The Independent: “We are as much spectators in this as you are. All the redactions necessary have been done and no last-minute issues have arisen. We have no objections to the report being published now.”The report cannot be published without the approval of the prime minister.Dominic Grieve, chair of the ISC said: “I cannot think of a reason why he should wish to prevent this report being published. It’s very demoralising for us when we find we put in months of work and, at the end of it, we’re not getting an adequate response.“It seems to us that this report is germane because we do know – and I think it is widely accepted –\u0026nbspthat the Russians have sought to interfere in other countries’ democratic processes in the past.\u0026nbspThe protocols are quite clear. If the prime minister has a good reason for preventing publication he should explain to the committee what it is, and do it within 10 days of him receiving the report. If not it should be published.”\u0026nbspLord Ricketts said: “The ISC are a highly professional committee and their reports are always worth reading. Since this has apparently already been redacted by the intelligence agencies there can be no national security reasons to delay publication.”\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The ISC need PM’s agreement before it can publish. So the issue is NOT Govt needing time to respond. Just publish it!...Their response comes later.”In a Lords question on Monday afternoon Lord Anderson, a crossbencher, asked why there “has been unjustified delay” in getting confirmation of publication from Downing Street, when normal practice is that such confirmation is “always a formality”.The peer commented that Downing Street’s\u0026nbspposition raised “suspicion of the government and its motives”. He pointed out that, contrary to what is being claimed by No 10, full redactions have taken place in liaison with the intelligence services and the Cabinet Office. He also stressed that the government does not normally give its response along with such reports, but later, having 60 days to do so.Lord Butler, also a crossbencher, told the house that the “process of clearing this report started on 28\u0026nbspMarch, seven months ago, and it was only the final stage, of being cleared by the prime minister which started in October.” He continued: “Surely the whole point of this report is that it is relevant to a general election coming up.

But the impact of releasing sensitive information needs to be carefully considered by the prime minister, with advice from civil servants, and this process cannot be rushed.”In 2017\u0026nbspSwansea University and the University College of California, Berkley,\u0026nbspidentified around 150,000 accounts with links to Russia that tweeted about Brexit in the run-up to the referendum.London’s City University charted a network of 13,493 accounts that tweeted about the referendum, “only to disappear from Twitter shortly after the ballot”.The National Bureau of Economic Research concluded the influence of Twitter bots may have impacted on the result and automated accounts may have been responsible for around 1.76 percentage points of the “Leave”\u0026nbspvote share. An analysis by cybersecurity firm F-Secure indicated that “suspicious activity” relating to Brexit-related posts on Twitter has continued after the referendum and continued this year.Questions have been asked about alleged Russia-related\u0026nbspbusiness activities of Arron Banks, the largest donor to the Brexit campaign, and a number meetings he and a colleague, Andy Wigmore, have had with Russian diplomats in London.Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore have firmly denied any collusion with Russia or Russian-backed enterprises.Substantial sums have been donated to the Conservative Party by wealthy Russians. These include\u0026nbspLubov Chemukhin, the wife of Vladimir Chernikhin, a former ally of Russian president\u0026nbspVladimir Putin, who paid £160,000 to the party in return for a game of tennis with Boris Johnson.In March 2018 the Conservative Party refused appeals by, among others, Marina Litvinenko, the widow of Alexander Litvinenko, allegedly murdered on orders of the Kremlin, to return £820,000 donated by various wealthy Russians.It pointed out that all who had given the money had been carefully vetted and were, by then, UK citizens.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But he four times during an interview on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme attempted to steer questions away form the government’s handling of the row and onto the issue of Jeremy Corbyn’s foreign policy.And asked on BBC1’s Breakfast why the government was sitting on the document, he replied: “I personally am not sitting on it. I’m standing here on the roof of Millbank.”Created with Sketch.Top 10 marginal seats to watch at the general election Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 2Currently held by Labour with a majority of 20310 Perth and North PerthshireCurrently held by the SNP with a majority of 21Currently held by independent, formerly Labour, MP Ian Austin with a majority of 22Currently held by Labour with a majority of 30Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 31Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 45810 Crewe and NantwichCurrently held by Labour with a majority of 48Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 60Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 75Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 2Currently held by Labour with a majority of 20310 Perth and North PerthshireCurrently held by the SNP with a majority of 21Currently held by independent, formerly Labour, MP Ian Austin with a majority of 22Currently held by Labour with a majority of 30Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 31Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 45810 Crewe and NantwichCurrently held by Labour with a majority of 48Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 60Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 75Unlike most committees of MPs and peers, the ISC cannot publish its reports without the approval of the prime minister. Its Russia report was completed in March and has gone through the process of vetting by security and intelligence agencies before being submitted to Downing Street to be cleared for release.Number 10 has claimed that the delay in publication is due to the need for the report to be extensively scrutinised for reasons of national security. If it is not released by the time parliament rises at the end of Tuesday, it is not expected to reach the public until after the 12 December general election.Security officials say secret Russia report can be published nowLabour demands PM faces questions over Cummings’ time in RussiaRussia’s internyet: Kremlin readies test for its ‘sovereign’ firewallFormer MI5 director general Jonathan Evans added his voice to demands for its release.“In principle, I think it should be released,” he told the Today programme. “Part of the reason for having an Intelligence and Security Committee is so that issues of public concern can be properly considered and the public can be informed through the publication of reports once they have gone through the security process.”Lord Evans, who led the security service from 2007-13, added: “If the government had a reason why this shouldn’t be published before the election, then I think they should make it very clear what that reason is.”Asked whether the imminent election itself was a reason to delay publication, he replied: “I can’t see why it would be, from my perspective.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is quite clear the Government is not following the usual process here. It reeks of a cover-up.”The ISC inquiry is believed to have looked at claims of Moscow’s attempts to influence the Brexit campaign and Russian money going into UK institutions including sizeable donations made to the Conservative Party.ISC chair Dominic Grieve has said he cannot think of any reason why Mr Johnson should wish to hold back publication.“It seems to us that this report is germane because we do know – and I think it is widely accepted – that the Russians have sought to interfere in other countries’ democratic processes in the past,” said Mr Grieve.“The protocols are quite clear.

That is in keeping with large amounts of data gathered from telescopes peering deep into space, including readings from the European Space Agency\u0027s Planck Telescope.But in a newly published paper, researchers note that the latest release of data from the same Planck telescope gave different readings than expected under our standard understanding of the universe. Those could be explained by the fact the universe is closed, the authors write – which would help explain issues with the readings.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberScientists find they don’t know how fast the universe is expandingTo resolve the problem, further research will be required to understand whether we have simply not detected another piece of the puzzle, or are simply a statistical fluctuation. But they could also suggest that we are lacking a new physics that is yet to be discovered, they write.The shape of the universe affects some of our most fundamental understanding of existence, deciding the geometry of how the cosmos is assembled.In a flat universe, parallel lines will run forever, just like if you draw a set of them onto a sheet of paper. But if it is not flat, they intersect: if you draw two parallel lines onto a spherical object like a football, for instance, they run into each other on the other side.Scientists have long been convinced the universe was shaped like that sheet of paper. But the new paper suggests that could be wrong, and it is not flat but rather closed.The authors of the new paper say that if it is correct that the data from the Planck telescope suggests we are inside of a closed universe, it introduces a new problem for modern cosmology.Part of the issue is a consequence of the fact that our current precise understanding of the cosmos is arrived it by combining different datasets – measuring different things in different ways – together. Scientists generally assume that those datasets are consistent, and come from the same cosmological model.But some of those datasets are actually in contradiction with each other. There has been intense discussion of exactly how fast the universe is expanding, for instance, and measurements from the Planck telescope have been in contradiction with others.Scientists have tried to reconcile these differences with alterations to our understanding of physics, or to suggest that there might not be quite such a difference as thought. But those attempts have generally relied on the assumption of a flat universe, the authors write, and that may be incorrect.The researchers revealed their findings in a paper, \u0027Planck evidence for a closed Universe and a possible crisis for cosmology\u0027, which has just been published in\u0026nbspNature Astronomy.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Several times he said he believed climate change was a hoax, though he later said he was joking when he said it had been invented by Beijing.The president has repeatedly raised questions about established science, even that produced by his own experts.Last year, a report published by various US government bodies and departments warned that with “continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century – more than the current gross domestic product of many US states”.Asked about the report, Mr Trump said: “I don’t believe it.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Nor is he remotely likely to hold the balance of power.There is no longer a route to the No Deal Brexit he wants. Nor any prospect of Boris Johnson caving to his demands for a pact, destroying the Tories’ unity. And it is patently untrue to say Boris’s deal is not Brexit. The Tory ERG simply wouldn’t back itso.It will end our membership, payments and free movement and extract us from the customs union and single market, with no “backstop” keeping us half-in. We would trade freely as an independent nation. And Boris alone can get us out. The sole alternative as PM is Corbyn, and he will keep us in the EU for ever.In a few constituencies Farage’s party could hurt Labour more than the Tories. Overall it is FAR more likely to prevent Boris winning the majority which is vital to delivering Brexit and without which it is lost. That is why Farage’s ultimatum to the PM delighted Labour.Two by-elections — in Peterborough and Brecon, both of which the Tories should have won — were gted to Labour and the Lib Dems by Brexit Party votes. On December , those could put Corbyn in Downing Street in a Remain coalition.At which point Farage’s legacy won’t just be that his vanity wrecked his le’s work.That a party he founded with only one aim, a real Brexit, became the very instrument of the project’s destruction.He will be remembered as the right-wing maverick who handed anti-Semitic, anti-Western Marxists an unprecedented chance to plunder the world’s fth-largest economy. The Sun admires Farage.His pressure brought about the referendum AND a better deal. But he could now be the author of a double national catastrophe.He and his voters should think again.WE’VE heard it all now.Labour’s Tom ­Watson, of all people, insists broadcasters must combat the Tories’ “fake news”.That’s the same Tom Watson who destroyed lives spreading a paedophile’s lies.Whose party’s campaign centres on a blatant fiction about Boris “selling the NHS to Trump”.Whose leader lies endlessly about his terrorist sympathies and anti-Semitism — then sinisterly orders reporters: “Just report what we say.”These charlatans lecture journalists about the truth.But they themselves are strangers to it.Andthey took power, Press freedom would be a nostalgic memory.The Sun joins everyone rooting for Owen and England’s rugby heroes.Best of ruck, lads!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But they never got one vote from our house. And I have been thinking of my parents over the past few days and wondering: Would they have broken the habit of a letime and voted for Boris Johnson Because that is the key to who wins this General Election. We hear a lot about how Boris has to woo “Workington Man” — “an older, white, non-graduate male from the north of England with an interest in rugby league and a tendency to vote Labour”. But it is not just Workington Man who holds the keys to  Downing Street now.From one end of the country to the other, it is all those voters such as my mum and dad, who never voted Tory before. That is who Boris has to woo and win. Those millions of Tory virgins.The polls all suggest there is a massive majority for parties which favour leaving the European Union. Butthat vote is split between the Tories and Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, then we don’t get Brexit.We get Jeremy Corbyn gurning on the steps of No. We get an economy in ruins. We get Venezuela without the nice weather.  But splitting the Leave vote is not a strategy for delivering Brexit. It is a cast-iron guarantee that Brexit is cancelled. If you want to see the result of the Referendum, you have to vote Tory.My mum and dad would not have recognised the rotten Labour Party of today. They would have been baffled, then angered, by the total absence of anything resembling patriotism among Corbyn and his Marxist mob.My parents would have scratched their heads at Labour’s immigration policy — to allow “as much free movement as possible” — not because they disliked foreigners but because they thought the identity of their country was worth preserving.My folks would never have trusted a grizzled old Marxist like John McDonnell with their hard-earned wages. They would have been wary of seeing the police force supervised by Diane Abbott.They would have noted Emily Thornberry sneering at the flag of St George while happily adorning herself in the EU flag. They would not understand how Corbyn could happily lick the sandals of Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA.My parents — the kind of people who fought our wars, paid their taxes for a letime and built this country up from the rubble — would not have spat on this Labour Party. And after years of seeing Parliament place itself above the people, they would have crawled across broken glass to get to the polling booth on December .My parents believed in democracy. They had no doubts about the importance of voting. They would never have voted for Jeremy Corbyn. But would they have seen that the Conservative Party is now their natural home That’s your historic task now, Boris — convince the millions of working-class patriots like my mum and dad that you truly understand their lives. Andyou can do that, you will win a landslide.We have heard a lot about the failure of fire chiefs and their policy of “stay put” which added to the death toll of .But there has not been nearly enough focus on the heroism of the firefighters who were there on that hellish night.Firefighters put their lives on the line for strangers.Yes, that is their job. But their job deserves our unequivocal respect and gratitude.PRESENTER Samira Ahmed is suing her employers at the BBC for £, in pay because she received a fraction of what Jeremy Vine was paid for allegedly “similar” work.I like Samira Ahmed on Newswatch and wish her well.But Jeremy Vine is far more of a household name. And when it comes to getting paid, star power matters more than gender.I would like to be banking the same royalty cheques for my books as JK Rowling. But best not to hold my breath.IN the Eighties I did a story on the politan Police’s Vice Squad, which logged the contents of the pornographic videos they seized while watching the raunchy action in fast-forward.I can still recall the bored, joyless expressions of the young Vice Squad coppers as they yawned through all that fast-forwarded filth.Now Netflix is offering the same sort of thing – aallowing viewers to watch shows at up to one-and-a-half times the normal speed. Don’t bother.If it’s not worth watching in real time, it’s not worth watching at all.THERE are million dog owners in the UK and I can’t have been the only one who cringed to hear President Trump boasting that IS monster Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had “died like a dog”. And exactly how does a dog die, Mr President In my experience, a dog dies surrounded by humans who feel as though they have just had their heart torn out. A dog dies surrounded by love. A dog dies bitterly mourned by the family it leaves behind.According to Trump, the IS leader, “whimpered, cried and screamed like a coward . . . in utter fear, panic and dread”. My dog is not going out of this world like that. When our Stan finally goes, many years from now, he will be in my arms and looking in my eyes.Death will be painless and peaceful. It will be a moment of love and grief. Who writes your lousy material, Donald  All this “dying like a dog” rubbish felt stupidly off-the-cuff.While the world is mightily glad to see the back of a mass murderer, the florid violence of Donald Trump’s language sounded exactly like the kind of crass rhetoric we hear from terrorists.The President’s sneering “died like a dog” line was particularly misjudged because American special forces were helped in their ultra-dangerous mission by military search dogs.They pursued al-Baghdadi right up to the moment he detonated his suicide vest, injuring one of the brave dogs – a Belgian Malinois named Conan – who will be honoured at the White House next week.Kill all the terrorists you like, Mr President. But there is really no need to talk like one.THE traditional Guy Fawkes Night celebrations of my childhood have largely been replaced by Halloween.This makes me incredibly sad, although my we says Halloween is far less dangerous than all the bonfires and bangers of my boyhood.But did you see this outfit Craig Revel Horwood sported on Halloween ROBBIE WILLIAMS, , has challenged Liam Gallagher, , to a boxing match.Really not recommended at their age. How long is it since Britpop   years Stick to a game of draughts, Robbie.I WAS forced to play rugby at school and always hated it.But I have fallen in love with the sport at this glorious World Cup in Japan.But North kept running – or hobbling – and STILL made the tackle.I do hope our soft Premier League footballers have been watching.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Happily, though, most of us know that, these days, coercion and force in the bedroom are not only ­unromantic but unacceptable.The offending lyrics in the song, which is a duet, are uttered by the female voice, which sings: “I simply must go, the answer is no” . . . only for the man she is singing to to hand her a drink — and for her to question what is in it. Obviously not good on any level. But this song was written in  .It was a hit during a time when sex was for marriage, and women weren’t actually allowed to express any active interest in men so had to feign modesty at all times. In the s and s, before the Pill was introduced, that dance of reluctance and “persuasion” was part of the courting process and the whole process of seduction was based on women pretending they weren’t interested only to be ­persuaded that they were.But look how dferent things are now.Also, let’s face it, when you get the magnying glass out, there are plenty of storylines from the past that don’t quite measure up to the standards of . Look at James Bond, who basically sexually assaults Honor Blackman’s ­character Pussy Galorein the movie Goldfinger.Or the song Every Breath You Take and the film Love Actually, both of which feature a stalker as the romantic lead. And when you think about it, Daniel Cleaver’s courting of Bridget Jones really just boils down to ­sexual harassment.There are countless other examples of “romantic” plots which are very dodgy indeed by current standards but, at the time, we all lapped them up. And don’t even get me started on the lyrics of rap songs that are being played today which routinely talk about killing and raping women. Now that is grim.But instead of allowing this song to exist as the relic from the past, soul singer John Legend and Kelly Clarkson have rewritten it. Their version now includes the lines, “What will my friends think If I have one more drink  ”.That is instead of “The neighbours might think,   Say what’s in this drink  .  Legend describes his version as having “a new-found sensitivity in the #MeToo era”. I’d put it a dferent way and say he is ­trying to re-write history.Last year a radio station in Ohio announced it would stop playing the original because of ­complaints from listeners saying the song, “didn’t have a place in modern music”. That’s fine. No one needs to play itpeople are offended by it. But the idea that we can airbrush the fact that it existed in the first place is ridiculous and I worry we are all in danger of trying too hard to be PC.The risk is we become so vanilla, so afraid of upsetting everyone with our view, that we stop speaking our mind, which is a form of societal repression. Yes, it’s good to stand up for what you believe in, but taking offence at the lyrics of a song more than  years old might not be the best cause to bat for.Everything has a context, andwe aren’t careful we will all be so worried about how “woke” we are that we will forget our own views and how to express them.PARENTS everywhere will be reassured to learn that even when you are a sporting hero your kids still think you are a bit of an embarrassment.Peter Crouch said in an interview yesterday that his daughter, Sophia, who is eight, initially asked him to stay outside when he dropped her off at summer camp – because the other kids were laughing about how tall he is .The thing is, as any parent will confirm,it wasn’t his height she would have found another reason that he had to stay outside, whether it be his shoes, coat or haircut.In fact, don’t worry Peter, as they get older they get embarrassed about you just for breathing.MILLIONS of motorists use their mobile phones while they drive. Thirty-five per cent of drivers under the age of , and  per cent of all drivers, admitted to taking their eyes off the road to check texts, email or social media, an RAC survey reports.But the current law means reckless drivers can only be prosecutedthey are caught using hand-held phones to call or text. Meanwhile, those who take photos or scroll through music playlists are exempt from punishment.So police have struggled to enforce the law because they are often unable to prove exactly what drivers are using their phones for. Bear in mind thata driver looks at their phone for just two seconds while travelling at mph, they will cover ft blind, drastically increasing their chance of an accident.So I’m fully behind plans for a ban on even touching a mobile phone while driving, which were announced – drivers take note – on Friday. It is thought the ban could be in place by spring next year.Drivers caught holding phones to browse social media, or even input a sat-nav location, now face six points and a fine of up to £. But how anyone can be complacent enough to check Insta while in charge of a moving metal box that can kill people is beyond me.I have not driven for ten years – I walk or get the Tube – but my kids do and it really bothers methey even so much as glance at their phones. There is no doubt that it is distracting – and dangerous for the driver, but also to others. So this proposed new law is nothing but a good thing as far as I’m concerned.I’VE never been one to embrace dressing up for Halloween or any other kind of forced fun.Sorryyou think that makes me sound like a killjoy, but one thing I have noticed with each passing year is the sexualising of Halloween going off the scales.Forget wizards, goblins and ghouls – every celebrity event seems to be populated only with sexy vampires, sexy ghosts and sexy witches. Witness Heidi Klum’s Frankenstein costume at her annual Halloween party in New York this week.The dress code seems to be wear what you like as long as it’s thigh-high, PVC or a bikini – with some fake blood. Dressing up should be banned – I haven’t done it since I was seven.ENGLAND’S poor rugby team. Yesterday they lost in the final of the World Cup after being fined for their response to the Kiwi pre-match Haka in the semi-final.Owen Farrell and Co stood in a “V” formation while the Haka went on. But it turns out they were supposed to remain in their own half, and some players didn’t.New Zealand’s Haka is all about intimidating the opposition. But the opposition are not allowed to respond The Haka is a dance about cutting off people’s heads.But it was England’s harmless response of standing still and forming a V for Victory – which I thought was brilliant – that was reprimanded.MY goodness, Rosie Huntington- Whiteley looks utterly gorgeous in her underwear.MS using her as a model is possibly its best marketing decision ever.You only have to look at her wearing nothing but white lace to think thatyou buy the same set, some of her beauty might rub off on you.I loved the comment from Cheryl Tweedy in response to Rosie’s Insta post: “And where do we get that body ”Nowonly that, too, was available to buy from MS.LOVED reading the stories this week from Angela Kelly, who dressed the Queen for  years.I particularly liked how she helped to avoid disaster at the  Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur after the Queen’s hat arrived at the last minute. Her Majesty had been due to wear the hat as she officially closed the games but was distraught to find that it was unsuitable.I wouldn’t normally bother reading tittle-tattle stories about the Queen, but knowing that she has consented for them to be told I am really enjoying them.Also, the closest this great lady has got to making a mistake in  years is to wear her hat the wrong way round . . . which speaks volumes about her, doesn’t it Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody can be sure how this Battle for Britain will pan out, any more than in .Tory election manager Isaac Levido told staff this week: “There is a steep and narrow path to victory.”Another aide says: “It is unknowable. This is fraught with danger.”Polls are all over the place, some showing an easily blown Tory lead of six per cent — less than Theresa May’s before she lost her majority.Momentum Labour has made a flying start with social media, bombarding targeted voters with eye-catching and wildly misleading messages — just as it did so successfully in .“You would think the Tory machine might have learned from that debacle, but they haven’t,” says an insider. “And you can’t build a new system overnight from scratch.”The challenge for the Tories is to define the battle lines within the first two weeks.“If it is a choice between Boris and Brexit or a second referendum — or even a third referendum — we are in a good place,” says an insider.But with five parties in this fight — the Tories, Labour, Lib Dems, Brexit Party and SNP — lines rapidly blur.Tory rebels such as Phil Hammond can also wreak havoc by standing as independents.Even Boris’s own ,-majority Uxbridge marginal is under threat from a bizarre invasion of Extinction Rebellion and Stop HS protesters.Nigel Farage, stung by Boris’s successful EU deal, has stunningly over-reached, threatening to field  Brexit Party candidates — although he won’t risk standing himself.His wrecking ball move has backfired among old allies including Leave campaign partner Arron Banks and one-time Ukip MP Douglas Carswell.His own party chiefs are in revolt, with Farage under pressure to back down fast.Cash donors have begun deserting and pro-Brexiteers are voting with their feet.One Sun reader, Brian Pearsall — a “paid-up Brexit Party supporter” — tells me: “I will be backing Boris. Mr Farage is beginning to annoy me. If he wants us to get out he should put candidates only in seats where the Tories have no chance of winning. What the hell’s got into him ”Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has also misjudged the national mood by junking Brexit altogether — and campaigning to rejoin the EU.Her party has slipped in the polls and she is offering pacts to a ragbag of Greens, Plaid Cymru and any other minority group who might offer a hand.Yet every vote picked up by Swinson and Farage in Tory target marginals opens the door to a Labour advance.The stakes in this General Election have never been higher — or clearer. More than million adults voted in  to leave the European Union.Unless they have changed their minds, this is their last chance of seeing that wish come true.No more ritual humiliation of humble MPs who incur his wrath or ministers who dare challenge his petty tyranny.Parliament will take a while to recover its ­dignity after a torrid ten-year political trauma. But the blighter Bercow has gone at last.Long live the new Speaker, whoever he or she may be. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Evenwe can argue about the “weather” bit.Two contestants, though, go straight into the all-time Apprentice Hall Of Fame, alongside the greats like Paul Torrisi and Stuart Baggs.First is Cockney barrow boy Thomas Skinner, who sticks out among the boys like Ray Winstone in a touring production of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert, and has turned out to be a lot more likeable than I was expecting.The second, though, most certainly hasn’t. For she is Lottie Lion, the librarian and wine snob who’s given to quoting Shakespeare: “For though she is but little she is a massive pain in the a**e.” Or words to that effect.All your worst office nightmares rolled into one, this girl. An undermining, ­passive-aggressive crawler who can swivel on a sixpence, depending on which way Lord Sugar’s wind is blowing.“In business there is no room for ­gambling.” “Hang on. Business is a gamble. You don’t take risks, you get nowhere.” “Yes, risk-taking is important, Lord Sugar.”Lottie’s also not helped by the fact she’s often right and most certainly wasn’t to blame for the failure of the scavenger hunt task which disintegrated, in ­shameful fashion, right at the start when team Empower’s Pamela Laird asked: “Does anyone know when the Second World War started ” Silence. They didn’t know when it started, ­finished, or even what side was responsible for killing Biggie and Tupac.A media meltdown followed, yet, amid the general despair, no one bothered to thank The Apprentice for the public ­service of flagging up this ignorance, because that’s not what happens with this show. Instead, it gets accused of stuff.This year, inevitably, it’s been called racist and claims have been made that the first four candidates were sacked due to their skin colour, rather than the fact they were completely useless or ­produced a “bespoke ­corporate ­lollipop” that looked more like a vibrator.It’s only Twitter that’s saying these things, of course, but they need to be quashed as the BBC is actually dumb enough to listen to these imbeciles and forget Sugar’s first winner was Tim Campbell and his show is about the only place on the network where black and minority ethnic people will be treated entirely on their merits.Get rid of The Apprentice and, I guarantee you, its ­precious and entertaining hours will be filled with the same mollycoddling, box-ticking, ­condescending, right-on ­b*****ks that fills most of the rest of the Beeb’s output.Treasure this show while you still can .The One Show, Matt Baker: “I’m very much looking forward to talking about your play, Meera [Syal].”The X Factor: Celebrity, Louis Walsh to Jenny Ryan: “Very few people can sing Shirley Bassey but you nailed every single note.”With a Black  Decker staple gun and no anaesthetic.ONLY two places there’s ever likely to be a demand for Vinnie Jones to sing Lip Up Fatty, by Bad Manners.One of them is Piers Morgan’s Hollywood wake.Thankfully, that’s probably still a good  or  months away.So I’ll stick with the other, X Factor: Celebrity, where we were already several horrors into the night when Martin Bashir’s brain developed technical issues, just as he was about to assault the second verse of EasyLike Sunday Morning.“I’ve forgotten the words . . .“A wah wah-waaah wanna be freeeee.“I do apologise.”Not necessary, Martin.Vinnie’s manic can-can took the initial sting out of things a couple of turns later.And, when it came to the climax, Simon Cowell dodged his decision and the public voted-off Jonny Labey and Victoria Ekanoye instead of a startled Bashir, who gasped: “What has happened ”You stayed silent.

It means I draw an emotional blank with the show’s incredible production valuesand even Ruth Wilson’s fabulous performance as Mrs Coulter.Initial stumbling block is the fact everyone’s trailed around by their own soul in animal form, Daemons who can all talk but never once stop to take a dump or cock their leg against the scenery.Teenage heroine Lyra has a shape-shting weasel thing called Pantalaimon, James “Asriel” McAvoy’s got Stelmaria the snow leopard and John Torode’s got a hairless gastropod called Gregg. But that’s another show, I think.On this one, there’s also the all-powerful Magisterium, giving everyone the creeps, and the uncharted north’s mysterious city in the sky, which James McAvoy is getting quite excited about.The detail that finished off His Dark Materials for me, though, was the news that arrived just before the climax of episode one.“Roger’s been taken by the Gobblers.”As the late, great Eric Morecambe once said, there really is no answer to that.Would it be fair to assume the BBC’s bisexual Dracula bats for both sides BBC’s darkly funny Guilt, with Mark Bonnar and Jamie Sives.The nightmarish, bird-eating Iranian viper footage on Seven Worlds One Planet.Lee Mack pretending to be Anneka Rice’s nude le model on the outstanding Would I Lie To You .C’s brilliant Celebrity Hunted climaxing with the question: “Is Gavin Henson really stupid enough to go back to his own house ” .And best ever breakfast TV host, Piers Morgan, marking his eagerly awaitedto Good Morning Britain by identying singer Ruby Turner as the rhyming slang for curry, “Ruby Murray”.Food food food, Piers.Clinton Morrison: “I think Mesut Ozil had a prove to point.”Jeff Stelling: “For United this is a matter of extreme danger with a capital X.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Piglet and Eeyore are companions of which fictional bear ”Matt: “Donkey.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Pemberton Place in Atlanta is named after the inventor of what soft drink ”Glynis: “Orange.”Bradley Walsh: “Which cabinet designer ­published a book of his own designs in  ”Vivien: “Mr Ikea.”And Bradley Walsh: “Dingoes are said to have been introduced to Australia by whom ”Kirsten: “The Kennel Club.”SO what’s it like in the non-stop Mardi Gras of ­EastEnders at the moment Callum: “I’ve been thinking of taking an ­embalming course.”CHILDREN In Need: Got It Covered.My ears: Got ’em covered.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last year she gave away her hundred millionth book.Dolly says: “My Daddy told me he was more proud of the Imagination Library than anything I’d ever done. I feel the same way because I truly believe this effort will last many years after I am gone.”Dolly’s ambitious book scheme has expanded all across the US, Canada, Australia and the UK, with Rotherham the first British town to sign up in .So she jumped at the chance to support our initiative, which has seen us team up with publisher HarperCollins to give away up to £million-worth of brilliant books to schools.New figures from the National Literacy Trust show a drop of more than five per cent in the number of primary-aged children who read every day compared to last year. And only  per cent of primary children read outside of school.We want to reverse these trends. Each primary school that successfully registers and collects enough tokens will receive a case of Collins Big Cat reading books containing more than  titles, worth more than £.Dolly’s Imagination Library sees children whose families sign up posted free books, funded via charitable giving.The singer says: “We’re trying to bring this gt to all children, whether they are from Scotland or Mississippi. Whether they are rich or poor. Or whether they live in towns or live in the country.“I am all about the values we all share in this world — love, respect, acceptance, integrity and commitment.”Born in The Great Smoky Mountains, Dolly was the fourth of  children to parents Avie and Lee.She says she is incredibly proud that her dad lived long enough to hear kids call her “The Book Lady”.Dolly adds: “This all starts with my daddy. He was a smart, smart man but he could not read or write. He never had the chance to go to school because he was a working man from day one. I could see how his inability to read or write held him back.“So I thought, ‘One day I am going to try to do something so all kids would at least have the opportunity to love books and to love reading’.”Children from big mountain families like Dolly’s dad often didn’t get the chance to go to school, and Dolly believes he could have done so much morehe wasn’t illiterate.Her loving parents encouraged Dolly to escape her “dirt poor existence” — largely thanks to her love of music and books. By six she was performing in her local church and at eight she had started to write songs.But she didn’t like school — with other kids picking on her because of her ragged clothes. She recalled once: “A lot of the parents didn’t want their kids running with me because I looked so cheap and tacky.”Books, however, offered an escape from her harsh youth.After the Bible, Dolly remembers the first book she read was The Little Engine That Could, a s American fairytale used to teach children the value of optimism and hard work. She says: “I have always loved its message of ‘I think I can’. What a wonderful way to encourage children to dream and to believe in themselves.“When I was growing up in the hills of East Tennessee, I knew my dreams would come true. I know there are children everywhere with their own dreams. They dream of becoming a doctor or an inventor or a minister.“Who knows, maybe there is a little girl whose dream is to be a writer and singer. But the seeds of these dreams are often found in books — and the seeds you help plant in your community can grow across the world.”Reading, according to Dolly, is the bedrock you need to write. She has written more than , songs, including Whitney Houston’s  global smash I Will Always Love You, has won a Grammy and has been nominated for two Oscars for her songwriting.Dolly, who in  read Louise Yates’ Dog Loves Books on CBeebies’ Bedtime Stories, says reading keeps her mind sharp as well as underpinning her music. She reads at least one book a week.Her favourites include Water For Elephants by Sara Gruen and The Count Of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas. She has said previously: “I’ve just always been a reader. There’s a part of my brain that can kind of think of other things while I am reading. It does relax my body, and I’ve always just loved to read.“I think, with kids, too, with the books that they read, it kind of inspires you to dream. If you can dream, that’ll lead you to success and to other things.”Dolly’s achievements outstrip even her wildest dreams. As well as her musical accolades, she has also appeared in box office hits including  To  in  and Steel Magnolias in , while her US theme park Dollywood attracts .million visitors a year.But she reckons the best accolade is the delight experienced by children she gives books to from the age of five.When asked about her legacy, Dolly displays the razor-sharp wit loved by her fans.

I knew something must be bad because they’re normally quite tough.By the morning they were blistering and I knew something was seriously wrong.They are readily available abroad and are sometimes offered in the UK at festivals and fairs.However, the NHS warns these tattoos can contain high levels of toxic chemical dye, which it is normally illegal to use on the skin.The paste contains an ingredient called paraphenylenediamine . In the EU, this chemcial can legally be used in hair dyes - but not for tattoos.Dr Chris Flower, director general of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association, explained: When applied to the skin in the form of a black henna temporary tattoo, PPD can cause chemical burns and lead to allergic reactions.In extreme cases, black henna tattoos can lead to swelling, blistering and permanent scarring of the skin.Black henna tattoos can also increase sensitivity to PPD, meaning you could have a serious allergic reaction to legal hair dyes.The boys were rushed to AE where medics confirmed they had a skin reaction caused by chemical burns.Doctors scraped the skin from their arms and have been applying moisturiser over the past week - with the twins having to repeat the process over the next  months.Vicki said: I’m living in hope it won’t scar them for le and that their skin will grow into it.If by sharing what happened to us we can stop someone ’s children being scarred then it will be worth it.On The Beach, who organised the two-week package holiday for the family, have confirmed the salon has been closed while they investigate.In June, we told how a five-year-old boy suffered nasty chemical burns from a black henna tattoo on while on holiday in Bali.And in May, a seven-year-old boy was left with horric scars after getting a temporary inking done on a family trip to Spain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it is such a tragedy that that didnt happen.A recent inquiry found residents had been told to stay put inside the tower block for longer than they should have, rather than telling them to escape.Yvette Williams, chair of the campaign group JusticeGrenfell, said the politicians comments were appalling.She told The Mirror: This is an appalling statement to make but unsurprisingly symptomatic of Rees Moggs ilk.Rees-Mogg has a privileged background, what is his experience of living in social housing  How many tower blocks has he lived in To suggest that those who followed his partys instructions were not using common sense is an absolute insult.Ahmet Chellat, who lost five family members in the horric fire, also called on Rees-Mogg to apologise.Mr Rees-Moggs comments have caused outrage in the Commons with Labour MPs calling them “shocking” and “appalling”.Jeremy Corbyn said: “What possesses someone to react to an entirely avoidable tragedy like Grenfell by saying the victims lacked common sense “People were terried, many died trying to escape. Jacob Rees Mogg must apologise for these crass and insensitive comments immediately.”David Lammy, who had a friend who died in the tragic blaze, said: “How dare you insult and denigrate those who died in Grenfell Tower Jacob Rees-Mogg “The victims of this crime of gross negligence followed the instructions they were given by the fire authorities. Do not blame them.“Your arrogance and condescension is monstrous.Lib Dem MP Sam Gyimah said: “Insensitive and disgraceful for Jacob Rees-Mogg to suggest the victims of the Grenfell tragedy lacked ‘common sense’.“Our duty as public servants is for the truth to be laid bare, for justice to be done, and to ensure this never happens again.”“They were told to stay where they were by the fire service, who were acting on national guidelines. He must apologise.”Mr Rees-Mogg offered his profound apology for the comments this morning.He said: What I meant to say is that I would have also listened to the fire brigade’s advice to stay and wait at the time. ‘However, with what we know now and with hindsight I wouldn’t and I don’t think anyone  would.What’s so sad is that the advice given overrides common sense because everybody would want to leave a burning building.I would hate to upset the people of GrenfellI was unclear in my comments. ‘With hindsight and after reading the report no one would follow that advice.

We will never give up until all of the changes we are calling for to protect residents have been made.We have and will continue to fully assist the Grenfell Tower Inquiry to understand what happened in order to learn and prevent such a tragedy ever happening again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ms Swinson is currently in a battle to be included in the leadership debates - despite being the fourth biggest party.

It’s just you, him, and the bomb, and you chat to him so you can buy some time in which you hope someone will come along, call the police, do the decent thing. So you talk to the soldier. There are lots of things he could be angry about with the people currently sitting above you – electoral fraud, using the NHS as a weapon, Brexiters campaigning against Brexit, Remainers who canapost agree on remaining – but the thing he is livid about is the Armed Forces Covenant. Not the idea of it, which is to ensure military personnel suffer no disadvantage due to their service, and sometimes get preferential treatment because of it. Nor the way it was enshrined in law in  with much fanfare, and the then-Prime Minister promising to “treat people with the dignity they deserve”.    No, he’s angry about the fact that within a year of it being made law, Parliament pissed on it. He’s angry that war veterans like him were made redundant just days before they qualied for a pension, while politicians facing reform to their own pensions got a higher salary to make up for it. Heaposs angry that veterans already investigated and exonerated of war crimes face being investigated again, even when no fresh evidence has been produced, and despite official promises it would stop. And heaposs furious that the veterans who gave their lives and their health for Queen and country - and in some cases, that of their wives and children as well - are still being ignored. Survivors of Cold War radiation experiments have been told evidence of their genetic damage is inconclusive that they must prove an injury sustained  years ago and that, eventhey do, they might be asked to prove it a second time.    Heaposs angry that ex-forces people still face barriers in finding jobs, homes, and mental health support. A study last year showed , veterans had psychological problems, , were in prison, and another , had no permanent address. He knows that everyone suffered in the past decade of cuts to public services. But he points out that those who are more in need of them always suffer most, and that only half of veterans who need that help ever ask for it. Heaposs particularly angry about the current governmentaposs commitment to the covenant, and the debt of honour it represents. He remarks bitterly that theyaposve finally signed it,  years on, and all that means is that the Tory party is now eligible for an employer recognition award. Oh, and theyaposve updated the the website.    Heaposs angry at the state of military housing,  years after the government said selling it off was a grand idea. Heaposs furious at the way his family had to go on a council waiting list. At how,they rent privately, a grasping landlord will rack up the rent for a building unfit for human habitation while their benefit is slashed. At how politicians call people who have to live in those homes scroungers, and say they should be put down. Heaposs angry at a Defence Select Committee report which said the Ministry of Defence was immoral and incompetent, and at a minimum income requirement for immigrants which blocks Commonwealth soldiers settling in the country they shed blood for. He quotes the committee chairman, who said: Every year we take evidence on the implementation of the Armed Forces Covenant, and every year we report similar complaints. The Government is failing in its moral obligation towards those who serve or have served in our armed forces. Heaposs angry about his mates killed for want of proper equipment, at a private defence industry quite literally make a killing with state-funded trips to dictatorial regimes, and heaposs angry at mealy-mouthed letters from politicians thanking him for his service and telling him thereaposs nothing they can do. He says politicians stand with the armed forces when it suits them, but turn their backs when it costs.    As he talks you realise youaposre angry, too. Youaposre angry about a Parliament that stopped governing in the nationaposs interest, and spent  years arguing over a thing that could not be done, purely because theyaposd staked their careers on it. Youaposre angry about allies who behave like enemies, knighthoods for men who hit women, a vice-admiral who consorted with a paedophile rapist yet keeps his pension, and his rank. Youaposre angry that because the people who took it upon themselves to run the country are unable to do so, youaposve been asked to re-elect Islamophobes, anti-Semites, incompetents and rabble-rousers so they can have another go at cocking things up, on a starting salary of £, a year.    You donapost like politicians pitting you against your neighbours because of how they pray or the colour of their skin. Youaposre perplexed about schools that have to shut down one day a week, about a NHS winter crisis that lasts all year, about a minimum wage which isnapost enough to live on. You thought all that crap was supposed to be over, by now. You remember how you were promised electoral reform in  and it never materialised. You wonder about the worth of a system that tells the critically ill to get up and work. You wonder how disabled people can have a better le without the allowances they need to pay for independent living.You realise that many veterans are disabled. And they are given the same crappy treatment as everyone , and often have to fight harder to be compensated by the employer who put them in harmaposs way.    You think about at your local postmaster, corner shop owner, launderette, binman, cabbie, cleaner, nurse, teaching assistant, council operative and heaven knows who  and wonder how, precisely, we’ll manage without migrants, and whoaposll be coming up with the points-based system youaposre told is such a great idea. Perhaps you look at your own bloodline. Perhaps you look at the history books. Perhaps, in the words of those who talk of sedition, treachery and surrender, you hear the echoes of bad people from bad times. You think about the fact .million people who could vote last time didn’t bother. You remind yourself thereaposs more than a million people missing from the electoral register - who should be on it, could be on it, but donapost see the point. You stand there, feeling angry, and think about how  years ago a war veteran with  yearsapos fighting behind him, who worshipped the same God in a dferent way, who felt oppressed and angry about promises his rulers had made and broken, stood in the undercroft of the Houses of Parliament with  barrels of gunpowder, some coal and firewood, and matches in his pocket.    You think about how that veteran was seized and dragged before the king, how he and his fellow plotters were tortured with the rack and other instruments for  weeks to produce confessions, and how after a show trial they were taken to the yard outside Parliament so the politicians could watch as they were hung by the neck, cut down while still alive, castrated, disembowelled, and cut into pieces. Perhaps you know enough to remember that despite injuries so bad he could barely sign his own confession, Guy Fawkes was brave and quick enough to jump from the scaffold before the executioner could stop him, breaking his own neck and saving himself the extra agonies the state wanted to inflict. You wonder why we still celebrate the capture, torture and death of that man with a bonfire and fireworks, why we have forgotten that it was once laid down in law we had to do so whether we agreed or not, and that for centuries his desperation was used to persecute others who shared his faith.    You wonder how we all forgot why he was so angry, or that after he was gone the oppression for people like him simply got worse, and lasted for more than  years. You remind yourself we live in a country where Catholics were banned from marrying senior Royals until , all because Henry VIII took against them.

But four years on, the National Audit Officesaid that, to date, no starter homes have actually been built.  Successive Tory housing ministers have claimed work was set to commence on the first starter homes. And none of their claims have proven to be true. In , then-Housing Minister Brandon Lewis - now an immigration minister - said: We announced a £. billion funding package to support the delivery of up to , starter homes. Of this funding £. billion will - in the first instance – be made available to remediate or assemble brownfield land to deliver at least , starter homes through the Starter Homes Land Fund. No starter homes were built.    In , then-Housing Minister Gavin Barwell - who was later Theresa Mayaposs chief of staff and has now been installed in the House of Lords as Baron Barwell - claimed the first homes would be built this year. He said: Thousands of new homes backed with financial support will help more first time buyers into home ownership. They will be built exclusively for first-time buyers between  and  years old at a discount of at least % below market value. The first wave of  local authority partnerships – selected on the basis of their potential for early delivery – will spearhead schemes. No starter homes were built.    While the Housing and Planning Act  created the statutory framework for the project to go ahead, the NAO said the relevant sections of the legislation has yet to come into force. But it said the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Governmentnow no longer has a budget dedicated to the starter homes project. Funding which had been earmarked for the scheme has instead been spent on acquiring and preparing brownfield sites for housing more generally - some of which was affordable housing. Between - and -, the MHCLG and its agencies spent £ million preparing land originally intended for starter homes.    The NAO said that, while it was possible developers had built and sold some properties which met the starter home criteria, legally they could not be marketed as such until the MHCLG had put place the necessary secondary legislation. The chairwoman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, Meg Hillier, said: Despite setting aside over £ billion to build , new starter homes, none were built.

His pledge came hours before the official start of the general election campaign.But there appears to be a catch to Mr Goveaposs comments. While Boris Johnson had already promised a probe by the end of the year, the Tory leader has been very careful to say it wonapost just be about Islamophobia. Instead, speaking to reporters in September, the Prime Minister said it would also comprise of prejudice and discrimination of other kinds. Campaigners claim this is downgrading an investigation and taking the focus off Islamophobia.    Mr Gove appeared to drop the conditions about other forms of prejudice when he spoke to BBC Radio aposs Today programme. He said this morning: We will have an independent inquiry into Islamophobia and it will be established before the end of the year. Yet after he spoke, multiple Tory sources told the Mirror they were unaware of any sht back to an Islamophobia-only inqury. And Mr Gove also told the BBC: We will have our own investigation into Islamophobia and prejudice. This may suggest the net is still widened far beyond anti-Muslim prejudice.It comes five months after Boris Johnsonaposs leadership rival Sajid Javid bounced fellow candidates into backing a full, independent inquiry into Tory Islamophobia.  After loudly inviting MPs including Boris Johnson to agree an external probe during a TV debate, he said: “Itaposs great that we all agree on that.”Yet weeks later Boris Johnson threw the probe into doubt by saying it would be a general investigation into all types of prejudice and discrimination, including antisemitism.Tory chiefs also repeatedly refused to reveal how many members they had suspended over alleged Islamophobia, despite a string of cases being reported to the party.And Tory minister Kwasi Kwarteng even suggested a full independent probe wasnapost necessary.

He was in the Speaker’s chair at the time of the Westminster Terror Attack of  March  - and the subsequent lockdown of the Houses of Parliament.    There was an outpouring of tributes in  when his -year-old daughter Natalie was found dead.

Tragic Evha Jannath, , died when she fell from the Splash Canyon ride during a trip to Drayton Manor in Staffordshire. She had been allowed to go on a raft with four primary-age classmates without a teacher when the tragedy happened in May . CCTV footage showed Evha standing up in the six-seater vessel and being thrown into the water moments from the end of the ride. She survived the fall and began wading through thigh-deep water towards a “travelator” carrying the raft to the exit.    But Evha then suddenly disappeared from view and was found by park staff lying face-down in a ft-deep pool next to the ride. Stafford County Hall was told she was airlted to Birmingham Children’s Hospital but died later the same day. Evha and her classmates had obeyed the rules to remain seated during an earlier turn on the ride while accompanied by a teacher. But jurors were told several of the girls flouted the rules on the second trip - when there were no adults in the raft. The inquest was told the youngsters, from the private Jame’ah Girls Academy in Leicester, wanted to see who could “get the wettest”. Giving evidence Det Insp John Quilty, of Staffordshire Police, said Evha did not sit on a seat at any point on the ride. “They were reaching out of the vessel, putting their hands in the water during the ride,” he said. “One girl said they were talking about who could get the wettest. They were having fun but sadly we now know the consequences of this.”  The inquest heard she stood up at the “worst possible moment” and fell head-first into the water as her classmates screamed in horror. Jurors were told the youngster, who was wearing a white headscarf and hooded jacket, could not swim. One of Evha’s classmates who was on the boat told police: “Evha was not sitting on the seat. She was on the step and fell off. “She was in the water, holding something. We told her to get on another boat but she could not. “We asked the other boatsthey had seen our Evha but they had not.” Another child on the boat said: “When we were near the end a big tide came and Evha fell in. “We told her to climb in a boat but we think she could not hear us.” A third girl said: “The others were talking about how badly they wanted to get wet. They were running about, trying to get wet. “I pointed out there were signs saying we needed to stay seated. “I checked my bag to seeit was wet. When I looked up Evha was not there. She was in the water.”  The group alerted a woman stood watching the ride, who spoke with Evha - describing her as “seemingly uninjured and calm”. Evha’s friends then told ride operators what had happened when their raft ed to the ride entrance. Jurors were told it took  minutes from the alarm being raised to the “leless” youngster being rescued from the water. Park staff performed CPR on Evha and used a defibrillator before paramedics arrived on scene. A post mortem revealed she suffered multiple fractured ribs and a broken pelvis before her death. The cause of death was initially recorded as blunt force trauma to the chest before being revised to drowning. Evha turned  just five days before the tragedy and had gone on the trip as a reward for her good behaviour at school. The inquest was told Jame’ah Girls Academy bosses carried out a risk assessment before the visit to the theme park. They agreed that a teacher would each be “allocated” five or six primary-age pupils. But the assessment only said they should be supervised “on rides or to and from rides.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lottery winners use 1m jackpot","story":"NewsLottery winners use £m jackpot to transform the lives of their autistic kidsDarren Donaghey and we Kate, originally of Walker, Newcastle, won big on a National Lottery Monopoly Classic scratchcard and have now made their kids biggest wishes come trueShareCommentsByJeremy Armstrong:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video winner-punching-above-weight-competition-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news lottery-winners-use-m-jackpot-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Daredevil George King-Thompson climbed the -metre building from the ground floor to near the very top in just  minutes on July . He was sentenced to six months in Pentonville Prison, a Category B adult jail, on October  after breaching a High Court injunction against people climbing the -metre building. Now his family are considering launching an appeal against his sentence and his manager has branded his actions heroic. His brother has also set up a petition to support their campaign which has received almost , signatures. His mum Hilary King-Thompson, , said: It isnapost right that somebody like George is locked up. He doesnapost have a criminal record. He is locked up in his cell for -hours a day. This is a civil offence yet he is put in prison with criminals. He has to watch his back all the time.    We are a very small family, we are absolutely shocked,  this is the wrong sentence. Despite being locked up, Mrs King-Thompson said her son, who is also a personal trainer, is keeping a positive outlook and is still training in jail. He has a little routine in his cell, he does sit ups and has books to read. And although she admits she worries that George, who has ADHD, may come to harm from his daring climbing feats, she thinks he is inspiring others. She said: Obviously I donapost want him  to die, he is is putting out a message — aposfollow your passionapos. If I said do not climb The Shard nothing would have stopped him from doing it. Nothing I can say or do will stop him from climbing. He is the most positive person you will ever meet, he can inspire so many people.    After Georgeaposs climb, London Bridge Station was briefly closed and he received a police caution after he was spotted on the side of the skyscraper at around am on July . Teighmore Limited - the owners of The Shard - brought legal proceedings against him for breaching an injunction designed to deter trespassers, which was made by the High Court last year. The court heard in the months leading up to the climb George made  scouting missions to the building. The climber was criticised by Mr Justice Murray who said he aposdeliberately and knowing breached the order because he would have walked past at least  copies of the order during his climb. George is managed by Bryan Yeubrey, who also manages French climber Alain Robert, , who is known for scaling skyscrapers across the world. Mr Robert has a huge following and a bronze statue has been built in his honour in China. Mr Yeubrey said he believes George is aposheroicapos and aposinspiringapos for climbing the building.

Kane Elliott, , was accused of assaulting his naked partner before stamping on her and slashing her back with knives. But Elliott told a court it happened during a really weird sex game after the pair had been drinking heavily. He denied wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, unlawful wounding and making a threat to kill and was found not guilty by a jury. Cardf Crown Court heard his partner wanted to try something new and asked him to strangle her then slapped him across the face.    Giving evidence at the trial, he said: “We were drinking heavily then the sex games began. She was very much into very rough sex. “She said she wanted to try some new sex stuff. It got really weird. I did not know what to think.” “From there it just got violent. Her idea was to involve the violence with the sex. She insisted on strangulation. She just wanted more and more and more. “She slapped me across the face. I was not expecting her to hit me. I realised I was not enjoying it. I pushed her off and told her to stop.” The court heard Elliott stopped and pushed her away, causing her to go mad and start smashing up the flat. Elliott said his girlfriend destroyed a wooden table - and used a table leg to beat herself up before swinging it at him. He added: I was knocked unconscious and came round to see blood and her playing with a kne. The next thing I remember was the police arriving. Prosecutor Meirion Davies, said: When police arrived they found his partner naked and showing signs of heavy bleeding and injuries to her face which was swollen. She had two black eyes. There were a number of slash marks on her back. There was bruising on her legs and arms. This was a savage battering.

The business owner claims it is important to teach Tia, , Brooke, nine, and Valentina,  months, to work hard but always make time for themselves. Her youngest tot isn’t old enough for the full shebang but has been soaking her feet in pedicure spa from nine months old. Despite gting them Louboutin shoes, faux fur capes and two pet horses, Hannah insists they aren’t spoilt.    Hannah, from Birmingham, claims to spend over £, per month on beauty treatments and said: “I am teaching my daughters how to look after themselves and to always make sure they pay attention to their skin, hair and nails. “We all adore our trips to the salon because it’s our time to relax, gossip and have a giggle. We get a facial and blow dry weekly and our nails done every two weeks - Valentina likes to sit on my lap and watch mummy get her nails done and she gets hers filed when needed. I draw the line at acrylics for the girls as they are too young and I donapost want their natural nails to get damaged. The school mums tend to laugh when they hear about our beauty regimes, but I just joke and tell them we are fabulous. “The girls are all little as who love getting glammed up - they always add an extra sparkle with glitter or a diamante to their nails. Valentina isn’t old enough to get her nails done but she loves our trips to the salon, she claps and says ‘yay’ when she has a pedicure and splashes around in the foot spa. “Trips to the salon is all my eldest daughter Tia has ever known, she has been getting her hair done since she was two or three.” Tia, who is studying art at college, praises her mum for introducing her to blow drys and facials as she says it helped her confidence grow when she was starting secondary school.    She says: “Most of my friends at the horse stables laugh because they wonder why I would get my nails and hair done to spend most of my time riding and mucking out our horses Kamario and Princess. “But I love our girl time and there’s no harm in looking good – it has really helped my confidence grow. When I was younger and nervous about starting school, mum would take me to the salon, and I would feel so much better on my first day. Hannah and her pampered princesses don’t just go to any old salon, and after much researching they found a salon that best suited them. The Lion Zen salon in Birmingham is one of their favourites - it is an eco-friendly salon that uses vegan friendly products for facials and water-based nail polish. She adds: “We have facials every week and it is so good for their skin Tia is a teenager now and she never gets spots.

She was just silent and I was scared I would see my son die in my arms. The operator was telling me to grab anything I could cut the umbilical cord with. Thataposs when I caught sight of my work shoes in the hallway. I grabbed one them, balanced Kayden on Vickiaposs stomach and pulled the lace out. I was just making sure I had tied it up tight enough.    He cried for a few seconds but then he was quiet. He was still breathing but I was so scared. I didnapost want to see him die in my arms and for it to be something I did or didnapost do. Turns out I managed to do the right thing. When we got to the hospital I had the doctors and the nurses patting me on the back. Iaposve always been told Iaposm a fast learner but this is up there with one of the most impressive things Iaposve taken to! Vicki, a former hairdresser added: Iaposm just such a proud mum and we. For Kayden to defy the odds and for Dan to step up and save the day was one of the happiest days of my le. Vicki and Dan found out they were expecting their second baby last October - just weeks after booking their wedding venue.    But at their  week scan the couple were told their baby was too small and would need to be monitored with weekly scans and regular doppler monitoring. Vicki said: He was a twin but unfortunately his twin didnapost make it. The doctors ran some tests but they werenapost entire sure what the problem was. Only that he wasnapost developing. They said his lungs wouldnapost have developed properly so would have trouble breathing. The couple still sent forward with the wedding - six days before the birth - and size eight Vickiaposs bump was so little she didnapost even need to have her dress refitted. She was suffering with a suspected placenta infection, so was booked in for a planned c-section in  weeks, due to doctors fears over a natural labour. But Kayden had other ideas - and  days early Vicki woke up in the middle of the night with shooting stomach pains which she mistook for Braxton hicks. Vicki, who also has son Castiel, two, said: Iaposve had another baby so I know what labour feels like. But when Kayden was on the way I just shrugged them off as fake contractions. I donapost really remember too much. I just went into shock.    This just wasnapost meant to be happening. Dan added: We had been in and out of hospital every other day for the past however many months so the pregnancy was closely monitored. If he didnapost have all the complications I would have jumped at the chance at delivering him. But I suppose youaposve got to be careful what you wish for. It was the middle of the night when Vicki woke up and said she had pains. I was saying, aposright, Iaposm taking you to the hospital nowapos but she was brushing it off as trapped wind or braxton hicks. We went back to sleep but she woke up again and thataposs when we started rushing around. I carried her downstairs and put her on the sofa. Then her waters broke there. Thataposs when I started to worry. The doctors said he wouldnapost survive a natural birth in hospital. After I grabbed the towels and called  I could already see his head. It was sheer panic but I couldnapost freak out as I had to be there for Vicki and Kayden.    But I was genuinely worried I was going to see my son dead. He phoned  and a call handler gave him advice, and  minutes their baby was born - with paramedics still to arrive. The woman on the end of the phone was amazing and she did help steer me in the right direction, he said. When he came out the umbilical cord had wrapped itself around his neck twice. Not only did I not know what I was doing, I didnapost want to unravel it because he was so tiny. I literally had his le in my hands. Then the woman was saying I had to find something to cut the cord. The thing is I was still in my boxers. I was in the middle of getting dressed when Vickiaposs waters broke. So it wasnapost asI just bent down and pulled the lace out of my shoes. The umbilical cord wasnapost long enough to pass Kayden to Vicki. She was just silent and I was scared I would see my son die in my arms.

The bombshell claim has been kept confined to the pages of royal biographer and journalist Kenneth Roseaposs journal since . But has now seen the light of day following his death and the decision to publish the behind-the-scenes revelations about Britainaposs most famous family.An extract, published by the Daily Mail , appears to offer an intimate insight into Her Majestyaposs relationship with her uncle Edward VIII, who sealed her fate as monarch when he stepped down as king to marry Wallis Simpson.   At the time, the marriage was hugely frowned upon as Ms Simpson was a twice-orced actress and deemed an unacceptable queen. It also conflicted with Edwardaposs religious views as a prominent figure in the Church of England. But head over heels in love, Edward followed his heart and abdicated so he could make Ms Simpson his we. They moved to Paris after being aposbanishedapos from the country and tied the knot in .  Edward famously said: I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.  He added that the decision was mine and mine alone ... The other person most nearly concerned has tried up to the last to persuade me to take a dferent course. The decision sparked a constitutional crisis and forever changed the line of succession to the throne, with the Queenaposs father, George VI, becoming the new heir. Relations between Edward and the rest of the Royal Family became strained for decades and there were also rows over his allowance from the Crown.    And it appears that the tensions between the Royals and the couple, who became Duke and Duchess of Windsor, continued for many years. Her Majesty is said to have repeatedly declined to invite the pair to a day at the races as an olive branch to smooth over the factitious relationship. Mr Rose, who died in , wrote in his journal on May , : Edward Ford [Extra Equerry to the Queen, and her former assistant private secretary] tells me that he used to suggest to the Queen that she might publicly heal the breach with the Windsors [Edward and Wallis] by inviting them for a day or two of Ascot races, where they would be swallowed up among the other guests. But the Queen said no.

The young mum noticed her children had their own space in their bedrooms when they needed some quiet time and her partner Matthew had the shed, but she did not have any space for herself. Ms Pool then decided to convert the under stairs cupboard into her new space. She cleared out the coats, toys and cleaning kit and for just £ transformed it into a phone-free mum zone complete with reading nook, calming candles and mood lighting.    She said: The reason why I made it is purely to have this space for myself. I thought I needed somewhere for myself to recharge, recollect and just proceed to be mum in a normal routine. Itaposs somewhere that I can call my own. She added a lot of mums do not put themselves forward and do not do much for themselves. Ms Pool said her mum cave is a space without any cleaning products or dishes to wash, where she can relax.    In here I can just breathe, take five minutes and just think about me, she added. Jessica from Shrivenham, Oxfordshire, said: I decided to make it because it was just a dumping ground and I got fed up with sorting it out all the time. I thought it would be somewhere for the children to go but then I thought no - they have their bedrooms. Sometimes us mums need somewhere we can escape to and still be near the children to look after them.  Sometimes Iaposll go take myself away for five minutes to give myself some space. Children take themselves away when they need a break and this is somewhere I can go. You hear about man caves and toy rooms, but Iaposd never heard of a mum cave. I suffer from postnatal depression and I felt like I needed somewhere I could take myself without inflicting my mood on the children and then I can come out and be mummy again.  She added: I took all rubbish to the tip, spent two hours painting, and spent about £ on it - on paint and shelves, the rest of the stuff is from around the house.

She started drinking in her s and by the time she hit  she was drinking all day, ever day, and it cost her friends and her job. But after overcoming her addition with hard spirits Nicola replaced it with another - caloric food. Nicola, , from Larkfield, Kent, said: The first year was very hard, in fact it was hell on earth, but Iaposve been clean ever since. I moved back in with my parents and that was it - the next chapter in my le. But Nicolaaposs addictive urges were not completely cured, as she ed to comfort eating to feel better about herself. With junk meals from McDonalds and KFC becoming a staple of her diet, over just four years, between the age of  and , she saw her weight balloon to  stone.    Gorging on up to , calories on a good day, she said: Iaposd eat huge portions of food at home or scoff unhealthy takeaways, before snacking on bars and bars of chocolate. I could easily eat three bars of Green and Blacks in one sitting. She soon realised she had been battling an unhealthy relationship with food since she was about five-years-old. I swapped one addiction for another. I stopped drinking and started eating for Britain. It got worse and worse and worse until I found myself squeezing into a size . Iaposve had an addiction to food for as long as I can remember. Iaposd even go as far to call it an eating disorder. One of my earliest memories is of sneaking crisp packets up to my room and hiding them there.    I think I was trying to change the way I felt. I wasnapost a very happy girl and I wasnapost very happy for a lot of my le. Itaposs no oneaposs fault, itaposs just the way I think I was born. After giving up the booze Nicola started gaining weight rapidly and before long her body mass indexwas ., compared to the NHS recommended range of between . and . But it wasnapost until a dream family holiday to America that she decided enough was enough. In  she travelled to Floridaaposs Universal Studios and she couldnapost wait to go on the rollercoasters at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter.    She recalled: Before I stepped on the ride, I was asked to get in the test seat to seeI would fit. They tried to fasten me in, but there was no way it was going to happen. Thataposs when I had the realisation about my weight.  Iaposd been in denial up until then. And, watching red-faced as her brother Rob, , who runs a cleaning business, enjoyed the ride alone, she finally knew drastic action was needed. I was so humiliated, I knew I couldnapost go on like that, she said. I just kept thinking, aposThis is really, really badapos After being turned away, I found my parents and told them what had happened and they could see just how upset I was.    But it was the shock she needed as, when she ed to the UK, Nicola started looking into having a gastric bypass. I knew surgery was the only way for me to lose the weight, she explained. Iaposve tried all the fad diets and they just donapost work. I did see my doctor, but I wasnapost eligible for the procedure on the NHS, because I didnapost have any illnesses related to my weight. In a way Iaposm glad I ended up paying myself though, as it helped change my mindset. So, less than two months after her holiday, Nicola was booked in for a gastric bypass, which entails having the top part of the stomach joined to the small intestine, making people feel full more quickly. Borrowing £, from her parents for the procedure on July , , at the Streamline Surgical clinic, in Harrow, north west London, which she has subsequently repaid, Nicola recalled: I was discharged after two days and I wasnapost even in that much pain. I thinkyou want something that bad it helps you put all of that aside. Kept on a liquid diet of smoothies and soup for the first week, within a couple of months she saw the pounds flying off, losing seven stone in less than a year.  It really was amazing - the food addiction had been lted straight away, she added. Eating a more moderate , calories a day, by swapping junk food and chocolate for chicken salads and fresh fruit, it was not just Nicolaaposs diet that was transformed - she went from a couch potato to developing an impressive exercise regime, too. I knew I wanted to live a healthy lestyle and maintain the weight loss, so I started seeing a personal trainer once a week, she said. A few months in and I found myself with another addiction - this time the gym! After losing  stone and completely overhauling her le, in October last year, with the encouragement of her gym instructor, Nicola trained to be a qualied personal trainer and is now working part-time at her local gym. The fitness industry can be quite savage and I wanted to give people inspiration, she said. I know Iaposve had help to get to where I am but itaposs so easy to put the weight back on when youaposve lost it and I want to help people keep the weight off.

You get a text the day before,” Joanne says. “You don’t get paid for those days, soyou’ve got childcare booked you end up paying out but not earning anything. Trying to budget is just impossible. In the whole seven weeks I was there, I earned only £,..”  Stacey Francis , , found similar problems when she took on packing work near her home in Harrogate. “You never knew what hours you were doing from one day to the next,” she says. “I was on the minimum wage and really needed the job but I’d never do that kind of work again. You don’t have any proper rights.”  A new film,  Sorry We Missed You , from the team that made  I, Daniel Blake , is released in cinemas from today. It reveals the pressures faced by gig economy workers, including those packing orders for online and other retailers. One in five of these warehouse workers in the UK is a EU migrant, making them especially vulnerable to exploitation. As Joe, a trained chef, explains, he and his colleagues were under huge stress. “It’s slave labour,” he says. “They check you all the time, every hour sometimes, to make sure you’re picking enough items.  “People would be called up to the third floor then you’d never see them again. They’d been sacked, mid-sht at am and left to walk home.” A  TUC report makes it clear that workers like Joanne, Stacey and Joe are being denied basic rights – and that the gig economy model is broken, saying: “Employers have sought to manage the financial risk that comes from the inability to guarantee a constant demand for a product or service by employing workers on contracts that offer flexibility for the employer, at the expense of pay and certainty for the employee.” New film exposes grim work reality "},{"url":null,"title":"top 20 smartest childrens names","story":"NewsTop  smartest childrens names for boys and girls in the UKThe top childrens names most commonly associated with high results in school have been revealed - and its good newsyour child is called George or EmmaShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  NOV NewsThe list was complied by a tutoring  using exam results from the last five years \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The victims - members of the LeBaron family, a break-away Mormon community that settled in northern Mexico - were on their way to a wedding and travelling in three SUVs. Ms Johnson was found dead in her car, but her daughter Faith, aged about seven months, was found alive after being thrown on the floor in the back of the Chevrolet Suburban, according to family. Three mums and six children, including twin babies, died as gunmen opened fire and one of the vehicles exploded.    Faith was rescued after spending hours inside the car with her mumaposs body. Initially, the mum and daughter were reported missing after their car was hijacked and it was feared both were dead. But Faith was found alive when the vehicle was discovered abandoned.   Relative Keisha Johnson posted a photo on Facebook of Ms Johnson cradling Faith, writing: This sweet baby girl was found alive! Her momma saved her le! She is an angel!Another relative, Alissa Jones, wrote: CHRISTINA’S BABY FAITH WAS FOUND ALIVE!!! The rescuers made it to the vehicle. She was found thrown on the floor.

And a relative named Jasmin Soulsby wrote: Christina Langford was killed, but her baby girl Faith, who they thought was dead, was miraculously found alive on the floor of her suburban.She has been there all day alone. Family members said three mothers and six children were killed when gunmen attacked the convoy near the small village of Bavispe, about  miles south of the US border.  Five of the victims were named locally as mum Rhonita Maria LeBaron, , her six-month-old twin babies, Titus and Tiana, and two of her other children - Krystal, eight, and Howard, . Dawna Langford, , and two of her children were also killed, according to family members. The massacre happened as the three mothers and  children travelled in a convoy from Bavispe, in the state of Sonora, to the Mormon community of LaBaron, in the neighbouring state of Chihuahua.  The LeBarons are an offshoot of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Heavily-armed soldiers and national police officers responded to the incident to secure the area and hunt for the gunmen. The governments of Chihuahua and Sonora states, both of which border the United States, said an investigation had been launched. US Ambassador Christopher Landau, who had traveled to Sonora earlier in the day on a prearranged visit, said he was following the situation very closely.

Dentist Tolegen Mukhambetov was seen man-handling the seven-year-old boy aposlike a dogapos when he tried to remove his tooth. CCTV footage in his Kazakhstan clinic shows Mukhambetov grabbing the boy from the dentist chair and throwing him back to be held by nurses. The boy was terried and struggled to sit still on the reclined dentist chair. He then threatened to strike the child with an implement he brandished in a threatening manner in his left hand. Two nurses did not seem to be concerned about the dentistaposs action.   Mum Kyzgaldak Saparova said she warned the dentist that her son was frightened of having his tooth out, reported Tengri News .She said: I was trying to persuade him to open his mouth for two hours. Three times we went into the room but he was so afraid and did not open the mouth. The last time the dentist aggressively told me to bring my son in - and immediately leave. I sat in the corridor and heard my son calling me – ‘Mama, mama’. She was told by her son that the dentist beat him.    Upon reviewing the surveillance footage, Kyzgaldak reported the incident to the police as she described the dentist grabbed her son aposlike a dogapos. She said: I saw the dentist was aggressive with my son, he grabbed him, and threatened him with his tools. “He grabbed him like a dog. I went to the police. I won’t let him get away with it.” Police confirmed they are investigating the incident on Friday and have examined the boy for injuries. Kaldymurat Aigarakov, deputy head of the Aktau Police Department said a forensic medical examination has been ordered for the presence of beatings to the child. The dentist later posted a message confessing that he aposstrongly shook and pulled the boyapos. The message read: I did not beat him, but I did pull him strongly. I scared him a bit to make him sit.

Seventeen members of the prominent Lebaron Mormon community were apparently travelling to a wedding in a convoy of SUVs when they were ambushed about  miles south of the US border. Mum Rhonita Maria LeBaron, , was slaughtered along with her six-month-old twin babies, Titus and Tiana, and two other children - Crystal, eight, and Howard,  - and the others were allegedly taken hostage eight miles up the road. Relatives feared Rhonita and her children were alive and trapped when their bullet-riddled SUV was allegedly set on fire and exploded. Another mum, Christina Johnson, , is said to have saved her seven-month-old baby girl, Faith, as she was shot dead.    The other three who died were named as mum Dawna Langford and two of her children - three-year-old Rogan and -year-old Trevor. Eight children who were in her car survived, including a teenage son who ran for miles to get help, a seven-year-old boy who was shot in the face, and a -month-old baby who was grazed by at least one bullet. One of the mums was shot at point-blank range in the chest when she got out of her car and put her hands up to surrender, and a girl that survived was shot in the back as she ran away, it is claimed. The victims - dual American-Mexican citizens - belonged to the LeBaron family from a break-away Mormon community that settled in northern Mexico decades ago.    The Mormons are well-known in the region and have had previous run-ins with criminals while speaking out about organised crime, but a member says there were no recent threats or warnings. Relative and local anti-crime activist Julian LeBaron was left distraught after visiting the scene, just a few miles from the Mormon settlement, and seeing the charred bodies inside the burned-out SUV on Monday. He said the victims were innocent and were caught up in a war involving rival drug cartels, suggesting it was a case of mistaken identity. He told Milenio TV: This was a mistake. We do not know why.  They are innocent women and children.  They were going to see relatives. It is terrible. The massacre happened as the family members travelled in three SUVs from Bavispe, in the state of Sonora, to the Mormon community of LaBaron, in the neighbouring state of Chihuahua, it was reported. Some family members said the victims were on their way to a wedding, while Julian LeBaron told the New York Times that his cousin Rhonita was heading to Phoenix, Arizona, to pick up her husband, who works in North Dakota and was ing home to celebrate their wedding anniversary. Rhonitaaposs car broke down and the gunmen “opened fire on Rhonita and torched her car, he added.  He said one of the women got out of her car and put up her hands, but they shot her point blank in the chest. There were no recent threats against the family, he added. Grief-stricken relative Leah Staddon, who grew up in the Mormon community, said the three mothers and children were travelling in three vehicles to a wedding. She said her nephewaposs we, Rhonita, and four of the womanaposs children - twin babies Tiana and Titus, and older siblings Crystal and Howard - died when their vehicle was attacked. Ms Staddon, who lives in Queen Creek, Arizona, said her brother found the bullet-riddled vehicle still smouldering with the mum and childrenaposs charred bodies inside and he recorded video as evidence.  Ms Staddon said her sister-in-law Dawna Langford, , and cousin Christina Johnson , , were travelling in separate SUVs and were also killed. She told the Arizona Republic newspaper: Itaposs devastating. Itaposs incomprehensible, the evil. I don’t understand how someone could do that.Ms Langford was travelling in a second vehicle with nine children, she said. After gunmen killed Ms Langford and two of her kids - Trevor, , and Rogan, three - they opened a door and saw more children inside and let them go, said Ms Staddon. Ms Johnson was travelling in a third car with her seven-month-old daughter, Faith, who was found alive in the back of the vehicle.  The mum was hailed a hero in the aftermath, with family members saying she saved Faith, who was thrown on the floor. Ms Langfordaposs -year-old son, Devin, hid the younger children - some of whom were wounded and bleeding - in bushes and then ran about five miles to the familyaposs ranch to raise the alarm after his mum and some of his siblings were murdered, according to family. Ms Staddon pleaded for help from US authorities, writing in a Facebook post: They are doing all they can in Mexico and we need America’s help. Please help get the word out.We need to get them all back home safe also do not travel to Mexico! The mafia over Sonora and the mafia over chihuahua are in all out war right now!!! The surviving children were taken to hospital. Family members posted photos showing an injured girl wearing blood-stained jeans, and injured boys in their hospital beds. Kenny LeBaron, a cousin of the mums who was killed, told the New York Times: “When you know there are babies tied in a car seat that are burning because of some twisted evil that’s in this world. It’s just hard to cope with that.” Heavily-armed soldiers and national police officers were deployed to secure the area and hunt for the gunmen. Initially, there were conflicting reports about the number of dead and the number of relatives who were abducted and missing.  El Universal, a national newspaper in Mexico, said  members of the family were killed in the attack, but family members later said nine were dead. Julian LeBaron shared a post on Facebook identying one of the victims as Rhonita Maria LeBaron, also known as Rhonita Miller. The post said she died with her twin babies - a  boy and a girl - and two other children aged eight and . Family members said Ms Langford and Ms Johnson and their children were missing when the charred vehicle was discovered, but they were later found. Lafe Langford Jnr, another relative, wrote on Facebook: “It is with heavy hearts and unspeakable sadness we inform you that the  missing Mothers… along with many of their precious INNOCENT children have been slaughtered and gone to their Rest. “We need this to be shared and the whole world to witness the atrocious inhumane and barbaric acts that were committed against us today.  He told the Salt Lake Tribune that the victims got caught in the crossfire of two cartels. He said one of the mum called a relative, who heard a woman screaming and other loud male voices in the background, before she was killed. Relative Nefi LeBaron wrote: They were ambushed.All  families were driving together in a caravan through Northern Mexico. We assume that they got in a mafia cross fire. The families are thinking that the mafia mistook Rhonita’s vehicle for a rivals, then proceeded to attack. They eventually realized they killed an innocent family.To cover their tracks they burnt the vehicle with all of the passengers inside.

This despite being married to Milojko Bozic since September this year. And local media reports this latest incident comes just weeks after Milijana was snapped naked in bed with another older man. In the photos taken from the show, Milijana can be seen kissing Mr Zabac and sitting on his lap.    Other images show them in bed together and local media reports she had sex with the other, older man while her husband slept next to them. The unnamed older man, who is reportedly older than husband Milojko, even attended their highly-publicised wedding. He is also said to be married with children, although Milijana denies having a fling with him.    She said: The person who posted those photos will be sued. They are selfies I took and I know who I sent the pictures to, and I know who posted them. I have seen this man a couple of times, but I have not been in a relationship with him.

At the time, she said: We were intimate. We didnapost have full sex, I satisfied him orally and he did the same for me. There was also touching and cuddling. Despite the apparent indiscretion, Milojko forgave his partner. But this time he does not believe that this is only a game and he stated: If you set it like this, our conflict will continue after the reality show.    He later added: Sheaposs playing me and is making a fool out of me. This is not a game this is real! Miliana is playing both of us. Milijana tried to explain to her husband that it was just a game.

United sent an emphatic message to the chasing pack in the Championship as they swept fourth-placed Inverness aside with a commanding display.Questions had been asked about the Tangerines’ ability to stand up to physical challenges on the road after three away defeats on the spin.Heading to a notoriously tough venue to face a strong Caley Thistle outfit in wet and windy conditions, United’s title credentials were going to be tested to the full .They came through their Highland examination with straight A’s, however, as they maintained their three-point lead at the top of the ision.A defeat at fellow title-hopefuls Ayr United is understandable and plenty of sides have found it dficult on Alloa’s plastic park.However, the - thumping suffered on the road at Queen of the South had alarm bells ringing after United’s defence coughed up cheap goals.A big factor that day at Palmerston was that Robbie Neilson’s side had been over- powered in the two boxes.Heading to another physically strong side in Inverness, the Tangerines would need to show that was a one-off.In came Paul Watson in the centre of defence, allowing Calum Butcher to step back into midfield after featuring as a defender at home to Partick.Much of Caley Thistle’s threat comes from hitting targetman Jordan White and then getting quality wingers like Aaron Doran on the ball from there.Arguably United’s strongest player in the air, Watson’s task was to shut down that supply route from White and he did that superbly.Supported by central defensive partner Mark Reynolds, Butcher in front and Jamie Robson and Liam Smith down the sides, the former Falkirk man was all over White at every opportunity.So much that Inverness boss John Robertson took off wingers Doran and Mitch Curry after just an hour.A-plus for the defence.In the middle of the park, Butcher was at his best while Ian Harkes showed his ability on the ball at times, though he gave up possession too easily on others.Paul McMullan and Louis Appere were real threats throughout, too.The former should have got on the scoresheet late on but the control the midfield had over their hosts easily gave them passmarks in what was a quality team display.Of course, so did the strikeforce with both Nicky Clark and Lawrence Shankland getting on the scoresheet.Clark has made a real impact since ing to the side after injury with two goals in the last three matches and is showing he can ease the burden on Shankland.He may have been having to run the line himself had the referee seen a clash between the Scotland man and Jamie McCart the same way as an enraged Caley Thistle side did, however.He didn’t and United march on to their next test, the small matter of a derby at Dens Park, on top form and full of confidence."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5db2ad05abd6b8.82495880.jpg ","title":"downfield golf course submit plans for driving

are continuing to probe activity at Downfield Golf Course after trees were cut down on land earmarked for a new housing development.Earlier this year the club submitted a planning application in partnership with developer Kirkwood Homes to build  homes on the land beside Dalmahoy Drive.It has been suggested by both the club and the housebuilder that the project is essential to guarantee the long-term future of the course.However, the trees have been felled before planning permission was even approved – leading to local residents accusing developers of a “done deal”.Scottish legislation requires that anyone looking to cut down trees needs to get a felling permission from the government, eventhe plants are not protected.A felling permission for the golf club was granted in  but has since expired.In addition, the land on which the trees have been cut down is designated as a “locally important nature conservation site” by the council.Despite this, the local authority has insisted that the land is not bound by any protective measures.Both Dundee City Council and Kirkwood have denied being behind the tree-felling.And despite repeated requests for comment the club is yet to respond.The Tele visited the club’s offices last week and were told the course manager, John Watson, was on holiday until this week.And despite the club’s ongoing silence, a new planning application has been submitted to city planners proposing a new driving range.Designs for the new driving range have been drawn up with the proposed housing in mind.A .m-high embankment is proposed for the

Electoral pacts could have an impact but, as we know from the general election in , parties tend not to talk until after the votes are in.While Labour are keen to keep a foot in both camps, political tribalism and pride appears to have shattered the potential of a pre-election alliance of pro-remain and pro-leave parties.Even US President Donald Trump suggested a leave alliance on Nigel Farage’s radio show last Thursday but the Conservatives are holding out.In Scotland, Conservative MPs are defending slim majorities.Standing down Brexit Party candidates gives them a solid chance of retaining their seats in rural north-east farming or fishing constituencies such as Banff and Buchan, Gordon, Moray and West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine.Leave votes were high in this part of the country, as well as antipathy towards the common agricultural and common fisheries policies, and conversations with those in the north-east tell me the SNP have a hard sell.Despite the SNP placing independence at the front and centre of its campaign, which aids the clarion call for the union, I believe the SNP willabout  seats north of the border with the Conservatives retaining about .I suspect the Liberal Democrats willonly a handful and it will be a bad night for Labour across the country.I believe a Conservative majority at Westminster is well in sight and, while the time of year might deter some from voting, I still expect a turnout north of %.The one anomaly is the Farage factor.

But I think we had more than enough chances to win the game comfortably.“Since then we have been a lot more clinical so we’re looking forward to tonight and we’re confident we will come away with three points.”Playing tonight also gives Dundee the chance to get a headstart on their rivals at the top end of the Championship table.Three points would put them above Inverness ahead of Caley Thistle’s home match with Dundee United and level with Ayr.With top and third playing each other it is a chance to make up some ground on at least one of them but onlythey can pick up the victory.Forster added: “It can be a good thing and a bad thing playing first, depending on which side of the fence you are looking from. For us, we are looking to go and win the game, get three points and try to put a bit of pressure on the other teams who are playing tomorrow.“We obviously had the game on Tuesday but we’ve recovered well and worked a bit on what we are planning to do on the pitch tonight through the week.“We are looking forward to it, we have a bit of momentum and we are looking to try to keep that going.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/medw-tele-sports-podcast-twa-teams-1-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street its a halloween

.Fast-forward four years – and the former road worker contemplates taking his own le every single day.A visibly distressed Scott today revealed he has dealt with a tumultuous few years that have transformed his le.The death of his sister Jennie Cameron was among a number of family losses in a short period of time.Her brave battle against cancer was documented in the Eveningbefore she died on the day she was due to be married in September .Scott was admitted to Carseview the following month after attempting to take his own le.Now the former St Saviour’s High pupil is urging for greater aftercare support for those struggling with mental health issues.He said: “Since I had an accident at work it has sort of spiralled from there.“From being a man who used to work to support his family to being like this is incredibly hard to take.“I was in Carseview on two separate occasions the month that I attempted to take my own le.“I still have suicidal thoughts daily.”His fiancée, Cheryl, had to become his carer as the family attempted to rebuild their le in Brechin.An unfortunate brush with the law had seen Scott appear in court earlier this year.The police found a haul of antique knives in his car on Fairbairn Street.Dundee Sherf Court heard Scott was encouraged to start collecting knives by his mental health nurses when he was staying at the Carseview Centre.Scott added: “I had just bought the antique knives that day.“It was a case of wrong place, wrong time, after dropping off a family friend.“That pending court case didn’t help with my on-going issues.”Scott had hoped with the support of the community mental health team he could get his le back on track in Angus.He admitted a lack of regular support had seen his progress “stall”.He added: “Whether its a lack of funding or overworked staff, I believe there are failings in the system.“I know of others who are in a similar position to me who feel they can’t get the help they need.“There are massive gaps in the system.”Scott said he wanted to tell his story so that people could be more aware that mental health issues “don’t just go away”.He added: “Despite leaving Carseview my mental health issues didn’t stop the day I left that door.“It is an ongoing struggle and you need those support measures in place.“I want to get the help to turn this around.“Although we have things like Mental Health Awareness Week I believe there is still a lack of understanding of the struggles people face.”A spokeswoman for Angus Health and Social Care Partnership said, “Multidisciplinary community mental health teams are available in every town in Angus.These teams include nurses, doctors, social workers, psychologists and allied health professionals.“Community Mental Health Teams also commission third sector

months in Friday’s derby at Dens Park.However, the -year-old will have his work cut out to displace the backline that defended so solidly in Saturday’s - win at Inverness .At the weekend, Connolly made histo first-team duties from the bench since tearing his hamstring in the last derby, a - win over rivals Dundee, on August .And boss Robbie Neilson says he could be ready for a starting spot at Dens on Friday.He said: “Mark has a reserve game tomorrow but we felt it was a good opportunity with a few minutes to go to get him out there and get him some first-team game time.“If he comes back in again, he’s had that bit of a test on his hamstring.“He’s trained magnicently and I think he’s in the best condition I’ve ever seen him, even when he was a kid at Kilmarnock. He’s really looking after himself and has been a great example to everyone so we just wanted to get him back on the pitch.”Goals from strikers Nicky Clark and Lawrence Shankland added to a first-half own goal by Caley Thistle defender Shaun Rooney as United racked up an impressive - victory in the Highlands.The goalscorers may get the plaudits but the Tannadice gaffer was delighted with the work done by his backline, giving Connolly some work to do to earn back his starting spot.Robbie added: “When you go to a place like Inverness, the backline is the most important thing for you.“Inverness put the ball up to Jordan White right on top of your back four and it can be easy to drop off. But I thought our two centre-backs and full-backs kept the game nice and tight which allowed us to get pressure on the midfield. That allowed us to push on.”Caley Thistle boss John Robertson felt Shankland could have been red-carded in the first half for an elbow on Jamie McCart.He said: “The assistant is standing  yards away and should have seen a clear elbow. It’s a tangle and maybe Lawrence is trying to free himself but, accidental or not, he has caught him with his elbow.”Robbie said: “Shanks has just tried to barge him back out of the way. The linesman was  yards away and the ref  yards away. The swarming of the referee blows everything out of proportion.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"tell-us-old-steamie-memories-win-tickets-classic-show","story":"GLASGOWS old steamies prompt many a memory for those, like Mary McCusker, who remember when they were found in all of the city neighbourhoods."},{"url":null,"title":"disability-apartheid-glasgow-city-council-defend-redesign-sauchiehall-street","story":"Glasgow City Council have hit back at claims a landmark overhaul of a city centre street is discriminatory."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-tell-glasgow-rally-independent-scotland-within-touching-distance","story":"An independent Scotland is \"within touching distance\", Nicola Sturgeon will tell a pro-independence rally in Glasgow later."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-city-council-planning-152m-budget-black-hole","story":"SCOTLANDS largest local authority is facing a poundm budget black hole over the next three years."},{"url":null,"title":"notre-dames-pupils-speak-keep-us-unique-keep-us-all-girls","story":"PUPILS from Notre Dame High School will hold a peaceful protest outside Glasgow City Chambers to tell councillors to \"Keep us all-girls\"."},{"url":null,"title":"new-cap-agreed-glasgow-primary-secondary-school-intake","story":"THE MAXIMUM intake for primary and secondary pupils in Glasgow schools will be amended in line with the catchment area for each school next year."},{"url":null,"title":"first-glasgow-offering-free-bus-travel-armed-forces-veterans-remembrance-sunday","story":"First Bus is to provide free travel toall armed forces personnel, veterans and cadets travelling to Remembrance Sunday events across Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"generous-glasgow-girl-8-gives-birthday-fundraise-disability-charity","story":"A generousyoung Glasgow girl is planning to celebrate her birthday with a twist ndash by raising money for a charity that has supports her disabled cousin."},{"url":null,"title":"thief-forcibly-drags-girl-15-seat-carjacking","story":"A THIEF forcibly dragged a teenage girl from a passenger seat during a broad-daylight carjacking."},{"url":"//www.societyaberdeen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/105/2019/11/iStock-879631660-300x200.jpg ","title":"colourful image projected onto aberdeen building","story":"A dramatic image has been projected on to the front of an Aberdeen building.The picture, which marks the beginning of Scottish Ballet#s winter season, was created by figurative artist Alan McGowan.The artwork is inspired by each of the Scottish Ballet#s  season poster images.Marischal Square is one of four iconic buildings to receive a projected image.

Do you need costume inspiration for guising, trick or treating or a fancy dress party Here are some top Victorian picks from the fancy dress costumes in our collection to inspire your choice this year.If you’re thinking about reusing a costume from a previous year, then you’re not the first. This dress was reused too! It was first made during the s from silk brocade. It was altered during the s as a fancy dress outfit that included fashionable elements of the late-Victorian era, such as a point at the bottom of the bodice.The machine-made lace was a Victorian add-on too. Silk was valuable, and clothes were often unpicked and reworked into something more fashionable.Or how about matching costumes  This boy’s cream satin fancy-dress costume was made in the late th Century. It is in the style of an th Century outfit with brocade jacket, waistcoat and knee breeches. Childrenswear in the th Century mirrored their parent’s clothes. Little boys often dressed in small replica outfits matching their father’s.Will you look at world cultures for your fancy-dress inspiration  National dress and folk costumes inspired fancy-dress during the late Victorian era.This Bolivian-inspired fancy dress costume dates to the early s. It shows how elaborate fancy dress costumes of this period could be. The lilac silk skirt has a matching fitted bodice decorated with cream lace. The net headdress has been stfened with wire.The cultures of the Middle East and Asia have long been a source of inspiration within fashion, design and the arts. The exotic and elaborate costumes of India were attractive to Victorians and inspired many fancy dress costumes. This cream silk Indian outfit has a robe-style jacket decorated with gold thread and beads, salwar trousers, shirt, cummerbund, hat, shoes and a peacock feather fan.For the Victorians there was no end to fancy-dress themes, with partygoers taking inspiration from animals, history, royalty, the military, the seasons, literature and fairy tales.

Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate. We are asking adults to step up alongside us and make this a turning point in our history.#Greta Thunberg was welcomed by the Speaker of the House of Commons, the leader of the Labour Party and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. She also spoke at the elite gathering of business leaders in Davos and at the UN.In March , school strikes took place in more than , cities around the world. Again in May, in more than  countries, millions of pupils took to the streets to remind the world that the earth faces a climate emergency.The strike starting on September  coincides with the UN Climate Action Summit in New York. Millions of people in more than  countries will walk out of their work, homes and colleges and spend a day demanding action on the climate emergency.I hear that many in Lochgilphead High School are planning to do the same # well done!Let us join them on Friday September  between am and pm to help build a future fit for all living beings.Mary Stirling, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column september 20 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsArgyll and Bute Council has a duty of care to pupils to ensure their health, and their safety, during the school day.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert! How is it that I had never even heard of that curious little bay. There it lay, calm and silvery, like a scene from a theatre. A striking and beautul spot.#In the modern era, many thousands of tourists visit Tarbert each year.

The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s. Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

It will include a new toilet, shower, laundry and kitchen building,  new camping pitches and  motor home pitches, most of which will have hook-ups.The total project will cost around £,. In addition to HIE’s contribution will be an award of £, from the Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund, with the balance from IGHT.It is expected that the modern site will strengthen the local economy by an additional £, a year and that other businesses on Gigha will benefit from the increase in footfall and visitor spend.The Isle of Gigha camp and motorhome site is due to welcome its first visitors in autumn , after which it will be open throughout the year.Strategic planning to secure a strong, sustainable future for the Mount Stuart Trust and the Isle of Bute is at an advanced stage, with key decisions expected by spring .Speaking ahead of the next phase of community consultations, Colin Boag, managing director of Mount Stuart Trust, said: #We are working intensively with community groups, Argyll and Bute Council and the Scottish Land Commission to develop a range of initiatives to improve the rural and urban landscapes on the island of Bute and to unlock growth opportunities for the local economy.#There is a great sense of purpose and commitment from everyone involved. This is matched by a desire to make progress on a number of crucial projects. The trust will conclude a strategic review by the end of the year. In conducting this - year ‘look forward’, we have been well supported through discussions with iniduals and community bodies across the island.#As part of the overall review, we are creating a specic rural strategy focussed on building a sound, sustainable future for farming and forestry on the island. Following an initial consultation with key stakeholders in July, we are developing the rural strategy through a number of joint working groups. These are examining key priorities including dairy farming, rural training and skills, forestry development and the environment.#Our emerging rural strategy builds on work completed with Argyll and Bute Council to support their bid to the Scottish and UK governments for a multi-million-pound Rural Growth Deal. Working together with the council, Fyne Futures and the Bute Island Alliance, we drew up a proposal for investment of £million to pilot on Bute a new transformative rural development model for niche food and drink and primary island industries.The trust is also consulting with local communities about the proposals to release urban land for community projects. This important work is being conducted in line with the Scottish Land Commission’s protocol on community engagement.In August, Mount Stuart Trust, with Scottish Land Commission representatives, held an urban community workshop with key community organisations in Rothesay. Discussion centred on how potential community projects could utilise land in Rothesay, which is currently in either council or trust ownership.Colin Boag added: #Throughout the discussions with ious community representatives, a number of local groups have expressed interest to make use of some or all of the land on offer. We welcome their interest in creating opportunities for positive change on the Isle of Bute.#I am confident that the depth of collaboration between Argyll and Bute Council, the Land Commission, local communities and the trust is set bring a strong sense of renewal and confidence to the island.#It was a trip to the Co-op and trollies at the ready for Lochgilphead High School pupils, as they were set a mission in aid of the Argyll Foodbank.Staff from the school ided the group of S pupils into teams, giving each an inidual budget to stick to. The senior students were then tasked with spending their money on Halloween treats that would later be donated to the local foodbank at Kilmory.Funds for the shopping trip were raised by a staff pumpkin carving session. Pumpkins, grown by the school#s science department, have been purchased by staff in preparation for the carving event that will take place next week. The money raised from this was then matched by school funds to give an overall budget of £.Over  items were purchased by the pupils on Thursday October , using their Young Scot cards to benefit from a  per cent discount and remembering to collect valuable points on their Co-op membership cards.The school has decided to make contributions to the food bank throughout the year, particularly focusing on Easter, Halloween and Christmas."},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries november 1 2019","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNumbers drawn in Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery on Monday October  were ,  and .

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"cairndows getting connected by community effort","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe end is almost in sight for a path connecting Cairndow around the head of Loch Fyne.Phase one of the path project # between the Tree Shop at Clachan and Achadunan # is already complete, but the much longer stretch between Achadunan and Cairndow village is currently being built, high above the A trunk road.Contractors have been employed to do the bulk of the work, thanks to grant funding, but  volunteers have been involved in what has become a real community effort.When complete, the five foot wide path, with a firm surface suitable for walking or cycling, will feature  bridges crossing burns and will have a specially designed crossing at the A above Cairndow village.The project, part of the Cairndow Action Plan, is on track for completion by the end of the year."},{"url":null,"title":"mod success stories from across argyll","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEight-year-old Emma Litster from Lochgilphead competed in the Highland dancing competition on Thursday October , held at the at the Gaelic College.

There are many people walking around freely drinking during these times.ldquoThis makes it dficult to identy those young people who are underage drinking when there are such crowds.Another wrote: ldquoIntoxication in these areas is unpleasant to witness. In all cases we are entitled not to be subject to the loudness and antisocial behaviour this leads to.On the other hand, some respondents voiced their concerns about bringing in alcohol bylaws: ldquoI think itrsquos a complex situation which deserves time and thought. Irsquom not entirely sure that reacting in a retrospective way is the best approach.ldquoI feel there are many behaviours and traditions entrenched in Scottish and Borders society around drinking habits.ldquoI feel personally that there are alternatives for many people socially that do not centre around drinking or going to the pub, such as the cinema, concerts, sports, dining out, etc., but not everyone has the imagination or willingness to explore these as valid ways to enjoy yourself.Another objector wrote: ldquoDrinking in public places doesnrsquot cause a problem in itself. Issues arise when certain iniduals drink alcohol to excess in any setting.ldquoThe problem, in my view, wonrsquot be solved by a blanket ban on alcohol in public spaces. There are already laws to prevent antisocial behaviour but they need enforced.Police Scotland also provided a detailed response to the consultation.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

Despite signicant effort over the last  months, it has not been possible to conclude the sale of the Campbeltown Creamery.When it became clear that a sale to a third party was unlikely, the local Kintyre farmers launched a plan to take over the creamery. Despite considerable work to find a way to take the business forward, especially from their steering group, advisers, the Scottish Government and staff at Campbeltown Creamery, they have not been able to find a financially viable long-term business plan for the creamery.Commenting on the announcement, Shelagh Hancock, chief executive, said: #We are disappointed that it has not been possible to conclude a sale of Campbeltown Creamery.

Nothing will change in respect to their co-operative membership of First Milk, and we will continue to collect and pay for their milk on the same basis as before.#James Barbour, chairman of the Kintyre steering group, added: #It was the right thing to investigate all avenues to seewe could keep the creamery open in Kintyre.

That is due to the harsh, economic reality of processing milk in an incredibly tough dairy industry that has witnessed so many casualties at both farm and processing level in recent times.#While this is very disappointing news, it is reassuring that all of the local farmers are members of First Milk and will continue to benefit from being part of a national co-operative with an evergreen contract and continuing to have their milk collected in the future.#"},{"url":null,"title":"harvest party reaps food bank donations","story":"At the group#s harvest party on Wednesday morning, each child, dressed in ious costumes, some spooky and some sweet, brought an item to donate to the food bank.Kintyre Toy Library meets every Monday and Wednesday from .am to .am, and on Thursdays from -pm, during term-time, in Springbank Evangelical Church Hall.For £ entry, children up to school age enjoy a range of arts and crafts, as well as songs and stories."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 1 2019","story":"It is devastating news for the Kintyre economy that one of the area#s biggest employers looks set to lose up to  per cent of its workforce.It must be devastating news for all CS Wind UK#s staff, with the uncertainty surrounding jobs made all the worse in the lead up to Christmas.The company#s next potential order is due for production in , so there is a future for the factory and we are sure the company is doing all it can to secure that future.Our fingers are crossed that the talks with Argyll and Bute Council, the Scottish and Westminster governments and other organisations are successful in finding a solution to the shortfall in orders.By chance, the news of redundancies at CS Wind came the same week as Amazon revealed its power purchase agreement with a Kintyre wind farm.Attempts by the Courier to confirm the location of the wind farm were unsuccessful but,it comes to fruition, it is to be hoped it will bring jobs to the area."},{"url":null,"title":"springbank and machrihanish help graces pals raise cash","story":"Two nights’ accommodation, a VIP tour and tasting at Springbank Distillery, and a round of golf for eight people at Machrihanish Golf Club were the star lot at an auction in aid of the charity.This was part of an event held by Blairmains Farm Shop and Coffee Bothy in Blairlogie, near Stirling, run by the Logan family and Meg Filshie, who are friends of Kintyre#s David Allen.David and his we Cynthia moved to Campbeltown just over six years ago when David joined Springbank#s sales team.

roundabout on the busy road.However, it was eventually decided that a bear, designed by renowned Scottish artist Andy Scott, would be created on land near the townrsquos Asda store and McDonaldrsquos restaurant, east of the roundabout.The sculpture will stand on top of a mound of earth.Ken Ross, from Hallhill Development Ltd, which is behind the proposals, told the Courier work was under way, with

Aberdeenrsquos Marischal Square.Work was delayed slightly to allow the re-enactment of the Battle of Dunbar to take place last month.The sculpture, which is made of welded steel and fabricated from steel plates of ious thicknesses, is a nod towards John Muir, who was born in the town before emigrating to the USA and playing a key role in the formation of the countryrsquos national park system.Planning permission for the sculpture was originally turned down by East Lothian Council after concerns were raised that the work of art would be a distraction to drivers on the A.The decision was appealed to the local authorityrsquos local review body, where Dunbar and East Linton ward member Sue Kempson said: ldquoI find the links with John Muir extremely tenuous and I donrsquot find it particularly attractive.However, ward colleague Councillor Norman Hampshire was backed by the committeersquos other two members ndash Jeremy Findlay and Stuart Currie ndash in backing the plans, which

like an advertisement for a safari park.Fellow community councillor Herbert Coutts was more positive and pointed to the impact of the Kelpies and the Angel of the North, near Gateshead.He said: ldquoI

car parking so some of our elderly customers are not now using the library.However, the report said there were hopes that when the new housing had been completed at Wallyford, where large development

library and customer services, increasing digital use and dferent types of events taking place within libraries.It said that the number of e-magazines and e-newspapers issued through the library

The River Esk snakes around the edge of the course.Prof Crofts expressed concern that dogs could easily swallow them, resulting in ldquolarge vet bills for owners.After ing the balls to the club, he has issued a call for the flood protection scheme, currently being drawn up for Musselburgh, to include measures to slow down water coming off the Pentland and Moorfoot Hills where the North and South Esk rise.Prof Crofts, of Musselburghrsquos Eskside West, a geography expert who has worked as a research scientist in Scotland, said: ldquoAlong the golf course there are very soft banks and you can see where they have been cut back, and probably there was some rough at the end of the fairway where lots of people have lost balls.ldquoWe cannot stop leaves and tree trunks being brought down the river but the speed of rise of the water level and its velocity shows that any flood prevention scheme for Musselburgh needs to look hard at measures to slow down water coming off the hills and into the river. Without this, the erection of walls being proposed in Musselburgh will not be public money well spent.ldquoMany of us feel the importance of the amenity of this stretch of the river ndash it is very fine.He said a tree planting scheme using native species should be discussed with landowners in the headwaters of the Esk catchment area, as government grants were available for such work.He said: ldquoI am talking about hundreds of thousands of trees maybe. Careful hand planting of trees is best rather than using tractors to dig ditches to prepare the land for planting as this would aggravate the problem by increasing the rate of water running off the hills. The trees would take up water from the soil.ldquoThe use of the reservoirs on the North and South Esk and the temporary flooding of the flat land along the river should be seriously investigated to store water during heavy rainfall and therefore slow the release of water into the river.ldquoIf you look at the flood issue, itrsquos caused by the river rising very fast but itrsquos made worsethere are high spring tides and a storm surge in the North Sea, and also a northerly wind across the estuary which piles the water up high and stops the river water escaping for a couple of hours either side of high tide.Professor Crofts has raised his concerns with consultants who are drawing up the Musselburgh Flood Protection Scheme and he has also made local councillors aware of his views.As for the coast, he highlighted small sand dunes which formed a natural barrier with grasses, which, below the ground level, had yards of roots acting as a natural catcher of the sand.Jackie Lambert, captain of Musselburgh Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was unaware of the issue regarding golf balls being found on the beach near the mouth of the River Esk.ldquoWhilst, the figure of  golf balls is signicant, it is unknown over what timescale these balls have accumulated andthey are all, indeed, from the course.ldquoNotwithstanding this, the golf club will happily participate in any working group looking at the wider issues of flood protection and the environment in and around Musselburgh.

I have edited it for publication here, but I have attempted to keep the story as close to the original as possible, and the story itself is completely the idea of the children.IN PRESTONPANS, there lived two nine-year-old children called Max and Lily.One day, they went on a bike ride to Preston Tower for a picnic. When they got there they laid a chequered blanket down on the grass, opened their basket and began to eat.They were about to leave after eating their food when they saw a robin perched on a nearby branch. It seemed friendly and the children fed the wee bird some of their leftovers.The robin then flew to a nearby abandoned cottage. The children were intrigued and followed the robin to investigate the cottage.They couldnrsquot remember noticing it before and they were wandering around it peering inside through small a gap in the wall. They couldnrsquot see where the robin had gone. They should have just left it but curiosity got the better of them and they searched for a way in. They were anxious to find out what had happened to the robin.But there was no way in, as the entrance and windows were blocked. So they clambered up the cottage wall, the bricks crumbling under their feet.Tired and exhausted, they finally reached where they thought the robin had landed.They found an opening which led to a dark passage. Despite being a bit scared, Max and Lily decided to investigate and walked down the passage. It was dimly lit by small gaps in the wall that let in narrow beams of light. At the end, there was a staircase. They huddled together as they walked.Then all of a sudden, the floorboard behind them collapsed.Now in fear and panic, they dashed up the steps of the dilapidated staircase into the attic.From the corner of the attic, they could just make out a small black figure running towards them.They thought they had seen the robin but it was something much worse. ldquoMouse! screamed Lily. Then they heard a glass shatter ndash smash!They were now terried and they sat in pitch darkness. The only light they had was the light that was seeping through the bricks in the walls.As they sat in fear, they realised they needed to come up with a plan to escape. They searched the cottage for a way out.As Lily investigated around the room, she tripped over a rug that seemed to have something poking upwards. She called out for Max and he came rushing down the stairs.As Max kneeled down to take a closer look, Lily revealed what looked like a trapdoor.Astonished, the children pulled the handle.It led to a tunnel which was flooded with candlelight. Who lit the candles  Max and Lily wonderedwhoever had lit the candles knew they were there.They entered the candlelit tunnel and one step at a time they cautiously moved forward.Then, slam! The trapdoor shut behind them and they jumped in fear. This was all too much for them to handle, they were desperate to get out.Then Max heard a soft but evil whisper: ldquoPlease stay, Irsquom lonely.In terror, he pulled out his phone and pressed  but it instantly shut off. ldquoPlease stay, said the voice, now sounding child-like.ldquoHelp! screamed Max and Lily through the gaps in the wall, but help never came.Then they heard something on the floorboards above.ldquoThere must be something up there, said Lily. ldquoI guess the only way out is to follow the candlelight.So they ventured further down the candlelit passageway.As the pair made their way through the tunnel, they could just make out what looked like a white figure approaching, who had a terrying grin with sharp teeth.Max and Lilyrsquos hearts beat uncontrollably as they sprinted away from this terrying image and as they did so all the candles blew out, throwing the children into complete darkness.Was this thing still there  The friends sat together in the darkness breathing heavily, in shock and terror.Suddenly, in the darkness, icy fingers gripped Lilyrsquos arms.ldquoWas that you rsquorsquo asked Lily. ldquoNo, replied Max.All at once, the candles lit up again. Max and Lily turned round and saw a horrying face: ldquoArghhhhhhh!They woke in the sunlight. ldquoWhat  said Max, confused. ldquoWhat just happened   added Lily.ldquoIt must have been a bad dream, said Max. ldquoBut both of us had the same dream, how is that possible ldquoWe had better go, they said.As they were about to leave, they saw a robin. They turned and looked at each other with a smirk on their faces and a chill in their bones."},{"url":null,"title":"port-seton-library-closing-refurbishment","story":"The library, situated within the Port Seton Community Centre, closes on Monday and will re-open on Monday, December .During this period, customers will not be able to borrow books or other loans however, they canany loans to staff at the community centre and the outstanding loans period will be extended during the refurbishment work.Anyone wishing to use a computer will be able to do so within the community centre.Councillor Jim Goodfellow, council spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: ldquoOur investment in the refurbishment of the library will result in it being repainted and the carpeting being replaced, which means that it has to be completely emptied for the work to be carried out.\"Loans can still be taken out or ed at any of the other branches across East Lothian and we have made sure that two PCs will be available to use within the community centre."},{"url":null,"title":"pumpkin-patch-nursery-boss-admits-defeat-closing-dunbar-nursery","story":"Jonathan Bruneau said the Dunbar branch of his Pumpkin Patch Nurseries would close permanently in two weeks after  years of looking after children in the town.The nursery was criticised in a recent Care Inspectorate report over changing staff and a lack of management.However, Mr Bruneau, who also has Pumpkin Patch nurseries in North Berwick and Haddington, said the problems had been created by Scottish Government demands.He said: ldquoUnfortunately we have had to admit defeat related to our ability to staff and manage our Dunbar setting.ldquoRecruiting management and senior staff has been impossible over recent years due to Scottish Government policies which have driven the average age and experience of nursery practitioners down to levels which are simply not appropriate to run a nursery.ldquoNursery staff work long hours for salaries which are not commensurate with the level of education and expertise they are expected to achieve.ldquoThis, plus the rolling out of , hours per year of free nursery care , has created a staffing crisis most noticeably felt in rural areas where staff cannot afford to travel from Edinburgh or beyond.ldquoThe final straw came when we lost our most recent manager after three months when she was poached by a nursery closer to home. This was inevitable as she had been travelling one hour each way to get to Dunbar and, even though subsidised by us to make the journey, a two-hour commute is simply not sustainable.Mr Bruneau warned of the impact of demands on private nurseries in April this year when his nursery in Haddington saw its grades fall in an inspection. He said: ldquoThis is a systematic problem which is causing a death spiral in the quality of nursery provision throughout the industry.The inspection report on Dunbarrsquos Pumpkin Patch rated its quality of care and support, staffing and management and leadership at twowith the environment rated a three .The report said that parents had contacted the inspectorate following its unannounced visit in August to discuss concerns.A high turnover in staff was raised by a number of parents, with one telling inspectors: ldquoOften when I drop my child off I have to introduce myself and my child to the agency staff.The report said: ldquoParents told us that they often did not know the staff when they dropped off their children in the morning, often resulting in their children being reluctant to attend.Mr Bruneau said that the introduction of mandatory SSSCregistration was creating recruitment problems throughout the industry.He said: ldquoBefore the advent of SSSC registration, our group of nurseries never used any agency staff as recruitment was simple. It included people of ying ages, experience and circumstance.ldquoIt was a healthy labour market now new staff are iniably under , inexperienced in le, work and certainly the care of children.ldquoNursery closures are inevitable as sites struggle to find staff, maintain standards and satisfy increased demand.He said his company had decided to rationalise itsservices, placing more experience in fewer sites, and called on the Scottish Government to reverse policies he said ruled out more mature staff from working in nurseries.He added that all five members of staff at Dunbar had been offered places at his other nurseries.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council, which used the Dunbar nursery as a partner provider, said: ldquoWe have worked with Pumpkin Patch as one of our partner providers, offering funded early learning and childcare for pre-school children for many years.ldquoOur officers have also provided extensive support to the Dunbar team to help them improve the quality of experiences following recent Care Inspectorate reports. Our assistance has been recognised and appreciated by the owners, who feel that we have done all we can to support them.ldquoWe acknowledge that this will have been a dficult decision for the owners and will have implications for their team at Dunbar. We also acknowledge the upset and disruption that the nursery closure will bring for parents using this service.ldquoOur staff will work with and support parents to find alternative early learning and childcare within the area that meets their needs.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoMore than , children are already benefiting from the expanded entitlement after we increased training opportunities and routes into the early learning and childcare sector, resulting in a record ,-strong workforce.ldquoWe are working alongside local authorities and providers to ensure the necessary workforce is in place ndash including running a national early learning and childcare recruitment campaign, increasing support for training places and modern apprenticeships, and enabling providers to advertise jobs free on the MyJobScotland website."},{"url":null,"title":"pensioner-completes-74-year-quest-discover-father","story":"David Simpson had spent  years looking for his dad after growing up in a Quarriers orphanage to the west of Glasgow before moving across the Atlantic.But his attempts proved fruitless until a visit to long-lost family in Elgin last year.John Hamilton, from Lost Haddington, then became aware of Mr Simpsonrsquos quest.He said: ldquoFrom the information David received from Quarriers, all he knew was that his father was a Jack Cunningham, a plasterer from Goodallrsquos Place in Haddington.ldquoHis niece AnnMarie Whyte did a search for Goodallrsquos Place and the result came back with a find against a Lost Haddington image for the old Goodallrsquos shop on the townrsquos Bridge Street this led to AnnMarie posting a question askingI knew who Jack Cunningham was.ldquoA search of the Lost Haddington collection for Cunningham brought back too many matches, so the search was honed to lsquoplastererrsquo and the results produced the equivalent of a Holy Grail image ndash a George Angus scan of a lsquoJohnrsquo Cunninghamrsquos security application to RAF East Fortune.As well as correcting the name, the image confirmed his occupation and address, as well as his height, hair and eye colour.A plea was put on social media for further information, which found that Johnrsquos nickname was lsquoGibbyrsquo and that David had a cousin living in Musselburgh called Janette Brotherstone.Mr Hamilton said: ldquoAlso, a further search of Lost Haddington for the word lsquoGibbyrsquo, with it being an unusual name, produced another George Angus image from  showing Davidrsquos father John when he was only five or six years old holding the date plate for his school photo ndash George had annotated the image saying the lsquoboy holding the date slate was Gibby Cunninghamrsquo, so when I sent David this image it was the first time hersquod seen his father.ldquoThe feedback from the Lost Haddington followers also indicated that John died in  when he lived at No  St Annrsquos Place.ldquoThrough the invaluable feedback which named Janette as his first cousin, David was put in touch with her and shersquos since sent him some old family photos showing his father throughout his le.ldquoThe photos came from Davidrsquos fatherrsquos home, where he died, as it was Janette who dealt with the death notices for both Davidrsquos father and Johnrsquos we Jessie Cagder.ldquoDavid visited Scotland in autumn  so I offered to bring him to Haddington, which he accepted.From there, David, who now lives in Rochester, New York, was able to see the home where his dad was born on Haddingtonrsquos St Martinrsquos Gate, as well as his homes on Goodallrsquos Place and St Annrsquos Place.It is thought Davidrsquos dad was lodged with a landlady while working in Elgin in .According to Mr Hamilton: ldquoThe landladyrsquos husband was away from home for two years as a soldier in World War Two and itrsquos during this period that John and the landlady must have had a moment of indiscretion together, which produced David!ldquoWhen the landladyrsquos husband ed home from the war due to injury and found his we holding baby David ndash that couldnrsquot have been his ndash he gave his we the ultimatum: lsquoTake him to the orphanage or itrsquos a orce.rsquoldquoAt the age of around one month old, David was taken to the Quarriers orphanage which is near the Bridge of Weir to the west of Glasgow.David left Quarriers at the age of  and eventually moved to Winnipeg in Canada in  before eventually settling in New York.More than  years ago, he began his bid to track down his family.

He identied some of the capitalist criminals Labour is coming for, including Sir Jim Ratclfe of Ineos. Though itrsquos not clear under what law the polluting plutocrats could be prosecuted.So, is this class war in the UK  Are we on the road to Venezuela  Whatever the polls say, a Labour victory this Christmas is quite possible with Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party now splitting the Tory vote. There is a powerful mood for change in Britain. But what would a Labour government actually look like We have never had such an avowedly radical Prime Minister ndash not even in , when Labour was led by a small ldquoc conservative, Clement Attlee. However, Labour reality would be rather dferent from the rhetoric. Burrow into Labourrsquos policies, and what emerges looks more like reheated social democracy, circa, than a Bolshevik revolution.For a start, we can largely ignore the issue that ided the party so bitterly in recent times: nuclear weapons. Jeremy Corbyn may be a lelong member of CND, but Labour is no longer a unilateralist party. Its  manesto committed a Labour government to renewing Trident almost indefinitely.But Corbyn will still enter Number  with a raft of left-wing policies, from seizing corporate assets to abolishing private schools as well as taxing the rich until the pips squeak. However, many of the headline policies will never make it to first reading, let alone the statute book.Abolishing schools like Eton would involve y court action, not least from faith schools and the home school movement, who might also be affected. Labour is more likely to confine its assault on educational privilege to axeing tax reliefs worth about pound. billionSimilarly, seizing % of the shares of companies with more than  employees would be fiercely resisted in the courts by shareholders. They have deep pockets. I suspect Labour would confine itself to increasing corporate taxes, ending zero-hours contracts and restoring trades union rights ndash all of which are eminently doable.Indeed, looking behind the radical rhetoric, much of Labourrsquos policy agenda is surprisingly modest, viewed from Scotland. Measures like free personal care, abolishing university tuition fees, childcare for three and four-year-olds, scrapping the right to buy, lting the benefits cap and the bedroom tax ndash these are all achievable.Indeed, the Scottish Parliament has already achieved them, bar the welfare cap. Nicola Sturgeon will no doubt remind the Labour leader of this repeatedly in coming weeks.Nationalisation is a policy that used to be seen as ldquoloony left but is no longer. Taking rail into public ownership shouldnrsquot be too much of a problem, since Network Rail, which owns the track and signalling, is already in public hands. The service franchises could be replaced as they come up for renewal, without needing to hand billions in compensation to Virgin and the rest.Waterand energy would pose greater problems, not least because most of our energy companies are foreign-owned ndash often, ironically, by state-owned bodies. But with a good wind it should be possible for Labour to find a way. Public attitudes to public ownership of utilities have changed out of all recognition since the s.Similarly, there is broad public support for Labourrsquos Green New Deal. A majority of voters agrees there is a climate emergency. Though they may not agree with the measures needed to tackle it.Labour is not going the full Extinction Rebellion route of making Britain zero carbon by . But its own policy, passed at conference, is still pretty radical. It commits a Labour government to making Britain zero carbon by . Thatrsquos only five years longer.We are talking about the most radical change to our lestyles since the industrial revolution. Labourrsquos policy would mean decarbonising transport, home heating and agriculture in a decade. Millions of cars would have to be scrapped along with millions of home boilers. Air travel would all but cease.Labour promises a huge investment in renewable industries to compensate, but that is unlikely to replace the jobs lost in the car industry, oil and gas, road haulage and retail.So expect the Green New Deal to become somewhat lighter green in government. There is likely to be a rt between the Thunberg-supporting ldquode-growthers and Labour MPs, who traditionally see economic growth as the best way to address poverty and inequality.However, Britain already has a rather good record on eliminating greenhouse emissions, and this will continue, albeit with the  target reduced to % net zero.In sum, Labour offers a practical social democratic programme which could be very attractive to voters, especially younger ones. However there is one very big problem: Brexit.Labour is committed to negotiating a new Withdrawal Deal to replace Boris Johnsonrsquosand to putting this to another Brexit referendum. This will consume a vast amount of political capital and will surely dominate the first year of a Labour government.Corbyn wants to reintroduce the customs union and Brussels would probably agree to that. But Labour also wants close regulatory alignment with the European Single Market, which the EU  would probably reject. If Britain wants to be in the single market, it will have to join the single market, probably via the European Economic Area, along with Norway.Labour could go along with that in the end, since it wants friction-free access to the EU markets. Single market membership would solve the Irish border problem, for sure.But it would also mean Britain continuing to contribute to the EU Budget, while having no say over decisions taken by Brussels. Customs union membership requires oversight by the European Court of Justice, which will displease many.But that wouldnrsquot be the main problem. If Labour got this wonderful deal, including workersrsquo rights and environmental standards, and got it through Parliament , would it really then campaign against it in the confirmatory referendum Interviewers have largely stopped asking this question, because they never get an answer, but Europe remains a huge question mark hanging over Labourrsquos government agenda.Labour is still a Brexit party, though you wouldnrsquot know it to listen to most MPs. Many figures in the party are closet Brexiteers, like Jeremy Corbyn himself. Others are openly pro-Brexit, like the party chairman Ian Lavery and the MPs who voted for Boris Johnsonrsquos deal.Equally dedicated Remainers ndash mostly Blairites and supporters of the deputy leader Tom Watson ndash would fight back, insisting that Labour effectively promised to back Remain in the General Election. Brexit wrangling could delay the confirmatory referendum and ide the party, just as it split the Tories.Corbynrsquos enemies will ignite further ision by condemning him as anti-Semitic. It will take immense powers of leadership to prevent a Labour government being halted in its radical tracks by Brexit.The question for voters is: does Jeremy Corbyn possess it "},{"url":null,"title":"conservatives-blame-snp-lib-dems-labour-new-brexit-clock-message","story":"The do-called Brexit clock now shows the amount of time since the UK ldquoshould have left the EU.The new countdown clock at #@Conservatives# HQ pic hIhEDQCxcA picture shared by Tory MP Harriett Baldwin shows the clock, now counting upwards, above which a message reads: ldquoTime since we should have left the EULabour, Lib Dems and the SNP hadnrsquot blocked Brexit.The original timer was unveiled by Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly on July  and was displayed beneath a message which read: ldquoWe will have delivered Brexit and left the EU by.The digital timepiece was one of two, each reported to have cost at least pound, with the other delivered to Downing Street to be displayed in the Prime Ministerrsquos office.:Ian McConnell: East Renfrewshire Tory MP ignores Brexit economics to point at SNP\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"description\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media RTLwxC poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests RTLwxC.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Downing Street has confirmed that Boris Johnson will not seek any extension to the Brexit transition periodhe is ed to No  in the General Election.Under the Prime Ministerrsquos proposed deal with Brussels, the UK will continue to follow EU rules after it has left the bloc until the end of  to allow the two sides to negotiate a new trade deal.:Boris Johnson will not seek Brexit extensionhe wins general electionParty Chairman @JamesCleverly with the ## We will deliver Brexit by October st.Back @BorisJohnsons pledge here: https:t.co ZkcKvLONpm pic aFFKfcavThe Prime Ministerrsquos official spokesman said the Government would not be seeking any extension to that as Mr Johnson believed there was sufficient time to get a trade deal.ldquoThe Government will not be extending the transition period.

Bruce also appeared to confuse Vote Leave with the Leave.EU campaign.The young woman defended her position, but was told by Bruce ldquono criminal charges were brought.The right-wing journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who was a list, then jumped in to say: ldquoThe vast majority of allegations about both Leave campaigns were found to be completely untrue. This was propaganda.The audience member was correct, however ndash Vote Leave broke the law. Yet, any viewer would have left the programme believing the opposite.This is a critical failure by the BBC. The national broadcaster is meant to provide unbiased, accurate reporting. It did the opposite on Question Time.This General Election is one that will be fought on lies, deceit and manipulation. Thatrsquos why facts, truth and trust are the most vital issues for the electorate.Herersquos a reminder of what the BBC should have told viewers. Vote Leave was fined pound, for breaking electoral law over spending limits. In March this year, it dropped its appeal against the fine. Vote Leave was fronted by Boris Johnson. Cummings was campaign director.The Electoral Commission said: ldquoSerious offences such as these undermine public confidence in our system and it is vital, therefore, that they are properly investigated and sanctioned.A day after Question Time aired, it emerged evidence relating to overspending, which could lead to criminal charges against Vote Leave, had been passed by police to the Crown Prosecution Service.The House of Commonrsquos Privileges Committee said Cummings had committed a contempt of Parliament by not appearing to give evidence when ordered as part of an inquiry into fake news.The fact that Question Time acted as a distributor for lies on an issue which is right at the very heart of Brexit and the forthcoming General Election makes the broadcasterrsquos failings ever more egregious.I donrsquot see bias at every turn with the BBC. Irsquove mostly great respect for the broadcaster in terms of its journalism and also its cultural output. When I see it attacked by both right and left, Leave and Remain, unionists and Yes voters, Irsquom pretty confident itrsquos doing its job and holding all sides of the political spectrum to account. Demonstrations against the BBC and hate campaigns against reporters run contrary to every democratic bone in my body. I see them as the first steps on the path to authoritarianism and populism.However, the BBC as a whole suffers from a fatal weakness: its automatic default position is to defend the status quo. When authority speaks, it accepts and parrots, it doesnrsquot question and interrogate. Radical voices are subjected to withering scrutiny, reactionary voices are treated with respect and dignity. This skews debate and immediately sets up imbalance.We saw the same problem here in Scotland during the independence referendum. The knee-jerk position was to subject the Yes campaign to forensic investigation, while broadly accepting most of what the No campaign said on face value. Both sides should have been put under the same pressure.There are also flaws built in to Question Time, which are now becoming damaging to democracy. The show isnrsquot about debate and getting to the facts, itrsquos TV clickbait. Itrsquos about screaming matches and outrage. Itrsquos a shock-jock show dressed up in the boring clothes of a politician.:Election : Jeremy Corbyn accuses Boris Johnson over NHSHere in Scotland, wersquore used to the games Question Time plays. Eyebrows were raised when a former UKIP member called Billy Mitchell appeared on the show for the fourth time in Scotland. Mitchell claimed he was invited by the showrsquos producer.The damage done to the BBCrsquos reputation by last weekrsquos show was immediate and deep. Shahmir Sanni, the whistleblower who exposed Vote Leave spending, said: ldquoOh my f**king God. Theyrsquore not even trying to hide it anymore! This audience member recalls Vote Leave breaking electoral law and Fiona Bruce literally lies saying lsquothey were cleared of those accusationsrsquo.Wersquoll be in serious trouble during this electionthe BBC shatters trust in itself. The public needs the BBC more than ever as an arbiter of whatrsquos true and whatrsquos lies in this era of mass manipulation and propaganda.Johnsonrsquos government is currently sitting on a report into Russian interference in British democracy. Dominic Grieve, the former Tory attorney-general, has called for its publication before the election.:Glasgow set to host BBC Question Time in run up to general electionThe Labour Party has began to question Dominic Cummings links to Russia. Emily Thornberry, shadow foreign secretary, wrote to the government asking about his connections to Russia and the level of security vetting to which hersquos been subjected in Downing Street.Amid all this, wersquove the truly grave threat Facebook poses to democracy. The social media giant will allow British politicians to run  ads on the site. To make the matter even more disgusting, the policy is being championed by Facebook executive Nick Clegg, the former LibDem deputy Prime Minister, who once spoke out about ldquothe colossal scale of the lies spread by the Leave campaign.Johnson and his new Tory radicals are also shameless in their deceit. Outgoing European Commission President, Jean-Claude Junker, said yesterday of the EU referendum: ldquoSo many lies were told, including by current prime minister, Boris Johnson, that there needed to be a voice to counter them.Chief among the voices countering lies should be the BBC. It shouldnrsquot be amplying hoods. Perhaps, one starting solution would be to change the format of Question Time by adding in a fact-checker service. While the  debate, a team of journalists could sit behind them double-checkingwhat they are saying is true. If they lie, fact-checkers should interrupt the show and tell viewers the truth. That would be a real service to democracy, and to the public, when we need it most.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":null,"title":"self-sample-home-urine-test-increase-cervical-screening-uptake","story":"Researchers have developed a way to identy pre-cancer lesions by analysing urine and vaginal samples that could be collected by women in the comfort of their own home.The ldquoself-sampling test proved popular with women taking part in the study, meaning it is likely to improve participation in cervical screening programmesmade widely available, they believe.Dr Belinda Nedjai, director of the Molecular Epidemiology Lab at Queen Mary University of London, said: ldquoThe initial use of self-sampling is likely to be for women who do not attend clinic after a screening invitation and countries without a cervical cancer screening programme.ldquoIn the longer term, self-sampling could become the standard method for all screening tests.ldquoThe study indicated that women much preferred doing a test at home than attending a doctorrsquos surgery.:Analysis: NHS too important not to be a political footballShe added: ldquoWe expect the self-sampling test to improve acceptance rates for cervical cancer screening, as well as reducing costs to health services and improving the performance of screening programmes.Dr Nedjai told the  NCRI Cancer Conference in Glasgow that the study was the largest to test for the S methylation classier, a chemical change to one of the four DNA base letters that make up the human genetic code.The test looks at the methylation of four HPVtypes most strongly associated with cancer and a human gene to calculate a risk score.It is estimated thateveryone attended screening regularly, % of cervical cancer cases could be prevented.

In Orkney, Police have joined up with Orkney Road Safety forum, to encourage cyclists to remain safe and visible, with not only education, but the handing out of bike lights.Police are reminding cyclists that along with obeying all traffic signs, traffic light signals and not cycling on pavements, they must equip their bikes with the appropriate lights and make sure they are lit when it starts to get dark.Officers in Orkney will be proactively looking to address cyclists who ignore the legislative requirement to illuminate their bikes in darkness, and will be providing bike lights to those who need them. Just over  pairs of bike lights have been purchased using funding from Police Scotland Safer Communities for this purpose.#Visibility is key to keeping cyclists safe on the roads and I would encourage cyclists to ensure they wear bright reflective clothing and illuminate lights on their bikes, both front and rear, in order to make themselves more visible to other road users,# said chief inspector, Matthew Webb.#This is equally applicable during the day, but more important at dusk and when it#s dark, to avoid collisions and warn other road users to their presence.#Some cyclists wear dark clothing and particularly on faster roads they can be almost invisible to drivers until they are close to them.#He added: #I recognise in this rural community that a lot of the measures are equally applicable to the equine community and they are more than welcome to make use of the same free offer.#This initiative has been supported by the Orkney Road Safety Forum who will assist with the distribution of these lights, which in addition to the police office, are available from the OIC hubs and Scottish Fire and Rescue Service Community Safety Advocacy.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Labour leader is expected to use an election speech today to claim that food safety standards would be lowered by a trade agreement with America.: Corbyn says post-Brexit trade deal with US risks rat hairs in paprikaHis stance appears to be backed by the UKPTO report which warns that UK ministers now have powers to make policy changes to food safety laws, including lowering standards, without primary legislation, thereby avoiding the scrutiny of Parliament.Statutory Instruments confer powers to ministers to amend and make future food safety laws for England, but they do the same for the Scottish Government for Scotland and Welsh ministers for Wales allowing for scope for devolution beyond what is possible in the current EU framework.According to the report, Scottish and Welsh governments commitment to retaining EU regulations could impact on any UK-US trade deal, and create the prospect of trade barriers between England and Scotland and Wales.: Scottish food chief warns that export certication system would collapse in no-deal BrexitOne of the authors, Dr Emily Lydgate, a senior lecturer in Environmental Law at Sussex University, said: “Food safety SIs are a potential flash-point for Scotland, which wants to maintain alignment with the EU, and Westminster which promises to pursue a US trade deal that will alter UK food safety legislation.“Negotiating a US trade deal that Scotland opposes is certainly not viable, and could even fuel a push for Scottish independence. “If one or more devolved administrations refuses to re-align its food safety regulations from those of the EU to comply with US standards, after a US-UK Free Trade Agreement, it will complicate the flows of agricultural and food products within the UK.“This raises the question of how the UK can avoid introducing internal UK regulatory controls and border checks to ensure that products comply with ergent jurisdictional requirements.”The UKTPO analysis suggests the UK’s post-Brexit food safety rules will fall short of the level of protection currently provided by the EU and warns that ministers are already using Statutory Instruments to change key policy areas and legal frameworks.It claims that the discretion given to ministers \"exceeds powers currently vested by the EU in officials\" and enables ministers \"to lower levels of protection for public and environmental health in the UK below those that currently prevail across the EU, without full scrutiny of Parliament and with weakened requirements for the integration of scientic assessment.\"The report also highlights the rush to push SIs through Parliament in advance of Brexit, using an \"affirmative procedure\" and the concerns raised by environmental organisations who have also been unable to scrutinise the legislation in the timeframe.It states: \"The SIs enable the possibility for ergence between devolved nations in some food safety standards that goes beyond what was permitted in the EU framework. As well as complicating the free movement of goods between devolved nations, this could contribute to the fragmentation of unity between Scotland... which has committed to maintain alignment with EU regulation, and England, which has signalled a desire to depart from EU standards in favour of a US trade agreement.\"Further, food safety SIs themselves provide delegated powers for the government to circumvent the legislative protections provided by primary legislation, giving more scope to the government to override Parliamentary opposition to changes to UK food safety legislation that implement such an agreement.\"The authors say the government has already replaced the EU requirement for independent scientic assessments on the safety of pesticides with leaving it to the discretion of ministers to decide whether or not to obtain independent scientic advice has omitted the EU provision for an \"effective, proportionate and dissuasive\", penalty regime for infringements and has allowed ministers to lower the threshold for products containing technically unavoidable traces of genetically modied organismsthat do not need to be labelled.The SIs have also seen the UK government revoke participation in RASFF, which provides a system for notying EU member states of unsafe and rejected consignments of food products leaving the UK an easier target for dishonest traders to unload rejected consignments and potentially lessening the appetite for UK food products within EU member states who would no longer be made aware of UK rejections.Professor Erik Millstone, Emeritus Professor in the Science Policy Research Unitat the University of Sussex, said: “Our analysis suggests Brexit SIs will allow ministers to exercise considerable powers of discretion when authorising ingredients in pesticide products, amending GMO authorisations and thresholds for labelling, authorising food additives and approving substances for animal carcass washes.“Ministers may issue guidance impacting substantive policy content or make new rules governing food safety by secondary legislation, without proper Parliamentary scrutiny, and using powers that exceed those vested by the EU in the European Commission.“Those considerable powers could be a way to overcoming Parliamentary resistance and public opposition to aspects of a UK-US trade deal.”: Scottish trade minister optimistic at solving US tarfs against whiskyEarlier this month Scotland’s Trade Minister Ivan McKee held “productive” talks, which covered US tarfs on Scottish products during a trip to the USA and that he had also outlined \"Scotland’s likely interests and priorities in the event of a free trade agreement with the US should the UK leave the EU against Scotlands will. These include the need to preserve Scotlands NHS and our food standards, workers’ rights and environmental safeguards.\"The academics recommend that primary legislation be required for reforms of legislative frameworks and major policy changes for food safety and that the scrutiny procedures for Brexit SIs be enhanced by providing Parliament with the ability to amend those instruments.The also say the devolved nations should receive strong oversight over UK external trade negotiations and encourage devolved nations to harmonise food standards where necessary for the internal UK market.“The meeting was a productive one, and I’m optimistic that progress can be made and opportunities seized upon to further improve trade relations between our two nations.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"general election 2019 nicola sturgeon won t rule out snp support for labour","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has refused to rule out the prospect of the SNP striking a confidence-and-supply deal with LabourJeremy Corbyn#s party fails to secure a majority in the House of Commons.The First Minister spoke with broadcasters this morning as her party prepares for the start of the official election campaign on Wednesday.Asked by Sky NewsNationalists would support a minority Labour government, similar to how the deal which saw the DUP support Theresa May’s previous administration, Ms Sturgeon said: “Let’s see what the arithmetic is.

Nicola Sturgeon is already being given access to the civil servicethe result goes her way.

SoBrexit does happen, the SNP will demand that Scotland has a veto over any trade deals.\u2028“Health is the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament, and no UK government should be able to sell out our NHS against our wishes.

Tactical standing appears to be taking the place of tactical voting - or perhaps forcing the electoratersquos hand in the matter. Polling has suggested that per cent of Remain voters cast their votes tactically in the general election, then a coalition of Labour, Lib Dem, SNP and other smaller parties could win a slim majority and defeat Boris Johnson.The thinking is why have two pro-Remain candidates on the ballot when it could actually ensure that neither win On the other side of the debate, the Brexit Party has been hoping the Tories pick up the phone to thrash out a similar scenario for pro-Leave voters.But just who is signing up to this, could it work and is it actually rather undemocratic Whorsquos zooming who Jo Swinsonrsquos party, the Liberal Democrats are pushing the idea of pro-Remain parties standing aside for each other, where one or the other is more likely to win a seat. Mostly because it believes itrsquos the party who would scoop up most seats in this way.With the agreement of the Greens and Plaid Cymru such a pact was put into play at the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election in the summer, with the Lib Dems standing a candidate, Jane Dodds, who went on to beat the Conservative incumbent, Chris Davies.Already the Lib Dems have reportedly agreed to stand aside for the Greens in the Isle of Wight and Brighton Pavilion, could step aside in Broxtowe, to help Anna Soubry, the Independent Group for Change leader and do the same for former Tory MP Dominic Grieve in Beaconsfield who is standing as an independent.Plaid Cymru has said its still internally discussing how an alliance with the others might work.Meanwhile in Northern Ireland Sinn Fein has said it will not stand in three seats to ensure a pro-Remain candidate wins. In South Belfast it will back the SDLP, in East Belfast it supports the Alliance candidate and an independent in North Down.What about Labour and the Conservatives Jeremy Corbyn has ruled out any deals or pacts with any other party - which is unsurprising given Jo Swinson has point blank refused supporting any potential Labour governmenthe is at the helm. But he has made overtures towards the SNP regarding a Corbyn government granting a section  order for a second independence referendum.However it would take a lot more than that to convince the SNP not to stand candidates in seats held by Scottish Labour or where it came a close second in . The SNP is determined to try and replicate its landslide result from the  election where it scooped up  of the  Scottish seats.Which is why itrsquos a bit upset that its pro-independence allies, the Scottish Greens, have said they will stand candidates against them, even in marginals like Perth and North Perthshire. The Scottish Greens know theyrsquore unlikely to win that seat, but they want to make a point about the SNP incumbentrsquos support for the oil and gas industry in a time of climate emergency. That point could result in a Tory gain.Which is one of many the Conservatives believe they could pick up, especially from Labour in the north of England, despite Nigel Farage believing his Brexit Party can do exactly the same.Boris Johnson is adamant he will not enter into a pact with the Brexit Party, so Farage - who has declined to stand for election - has said his party will field  candidates across the UK, leading to concerns among Brexiteers that the pro-Leave support will be split. And over in Northern Ireland, the pro-Leave parties have also failed to reach any agreement on pacts. The Ulster Unionist Partyhas announced it will stand in all  constituencies, despite the fact that unionist parties traditionally agree not to stand against each other in certain constituencies. Unsurprisingly the Democratic Unionist Partyisnrsquot too happy about this, calling the decision \"bonkers\".Is all this democratic It might feel a little odd, and possibly even redolent of smoke-filled backroom deals, but there are no rules which state that parties must stand candidates against each other, though it has been the tradition that the biggest parties stand in every constituency in order to win the largest share of the vote, and hopefully also the greatest number of seats. But normally, general elections are fought on taxation and domestic issues, such as the NHS, education, policing and housing - this one is rather exceptional in that the subject at the heart of the campaign is Brexit and all that appears to matter isyoursquore Remain or Leave. At the last general election  of the  winning candidates received less than  per cent of the vote, which means they could likely have been defeatedall the people voting for other parties only had the one alternative to choose from.So parties who agree on Brexit have a lot to gainthey can co-ordinate their supporters at the ballot box.Ultimately though it does require voters being prepared to cast their vote for a party which they may not ordinarily choose.

The Arts also let people see their inidual and collective issues, wants and needs from dferent perspectives, so also assist democracy.Expressing our creativity is also a FUNdamental part of being human, and happily there are good dancers, singers and storytellers everywhere.If humanity is to survive and prosper an understanding of the Sciences and of the STEM subjects, is vital. Sadly our political classes are mostly in ignorance of the sciences, at every level. Their bizarre and idiotic decisions display that so well.

I do think the government has to recognise the costs up here.#Ms Henderson described food bank usage as #shocking in this day and age#, and highlighted the Trussel Trust – the organisation behind the food bank – which had data on who is accessing the service.#Once you#ve got clearer information on the problem you can look at ways of dealing with it.#She described as #a sin# that perfectly good food was being thrown out by supermarkets just because it was at or near its sell-by date.Mr Robinson said the government#s roll-out of the universal credit was at the #root cause# of the problem.#It#s been an absolute shambles. How they expected folk could go for weeks without any money at all, just with the the promise it would be sorted out, I think is disgraceful.#He said the much-maligned #bedroom tax# had also been a contributing factor, and added it was important for people both in public and private sectors to have a fair living wage.Ms Valente said she had been shocked by the numbers of people who needed to use the food bank but were too ashamed of their poverty.#The cost of housing is one of the things I find quite shocking,# she said, adding that people needed to #earn a huge amount of money# to put a roof over their heads.She was also #appalled# by universal credit, and added it was wrong for society to #really target# or make people feel bad about being poor.Mr Wenger said people were encouraged to go to Citizens Advice Bureau, which could advise people on how to manage their finances.But Debra Nicolson, who stood as the Green candidate in the recent Holyrood campaign, pressed for more information on what candidates would doelected.Other questions were asked about the stigma attached to free school meals, and how it can be tackled.Ms Valente said responsibility lay with the government, but stressed the council needed to ensure social work staff and support services were fully prepared to help.Mr Robinson pointed to the -plus housing waiting list, and stressed affordable housing was key to solving the problem.Ms Henderson added there was an #antiquated rule# in the council that a percentage of the housing stock had to be kept free in case there was an emergency, and added she had argued that should be scrapped because #people need houses now#.Mr Flaws added there would always be a stigma until people are prepared to talk more openly about it.Mr Wenger said beating stigma, and preventing discrimination, needed to start at an early age. He added SSE had raised energy prices three times in one year, and stressed the issue should be picked up in the council.A former councillor, Iris Hawkins, wondered how well the candidates would adjust to #le in the goldfish bowl.#Mr Wenger said many people knew him already as a postman and as a tourist guide. He said he was a member of Transition Shetland.As a German, he said people had noticed his lack of Shetland dialect, although he admitted having problems with English accents, too.#The most problems I have with the English isI look down to the #sooth-moothers# at  Downing Street#.Ms Valente said being a councillor meant #you can#t win#, because pleasing one person would mean upsetting another.#You just have to do the best job that you can so you can sleep at night with a clean conscience.#You just have to do the best job that you can so you can sleep well at night with a clean conscience# FRANCIS VALENTEMr Robinson has #been there before#.

It suits me now#. Once that#s done you just have to get on with it.#As for Ms Henderson, she stressed she would be #very happy# to be accountable from the start.#There will be no curtains in my goldfish bowl,# she said.The site of a new Gilbert Bain Hospital was then brought up by chairman Jim Anderson, with Mr Robinson – who chairs NHS Shetland – left feeling distinctly on the spot.#I think wherever the site is it needs to be somewhere that is close to,not within, Lerwick.

Where did the candidates stand on this in light of the climate emergency Mr Flaws said he believed that was why the council had not yet declared a climate emergency.#The council is going to have to update its carbon management plan and see how it is going to bring this forward.#The council needs to be more transparent on what their long-term thinking is.#Part of the discussion focused on the Viking Energy windfarm.Ms Henderson said it was dficult to address Sullom Voe #until they#ve said what they want to do#.She added she was #not a fan# of the inter-connector, and the Viking windfarm was #not a green scheme – it#s only green in the context of money#.Meanwhile, Mr Robinson said the council should declare a climate emergency #and not worry about the oil companies#.He said BP had a #huge solar arm# in its organisation, while Total also promoted its environmental credentials and the Danish Dong Energy had gone completely out of the oil and gas sector.#Without declaring the emergency I don#t think there#s any real impetus to do anything.#Without declaring the emergency I don#t think there#s any real impetus to do anything– GARY ROBINSONMr Wenger said Sullom Voe helped provide the UK with oil and gas.But he said attitudes were changing, particularly with a growth in electric car usage.#Electricity you can produce without burning fossil fuels is the best.#Ms Valente said it was impossible to get rid of fossil fuels #over night#, but stressed thinking had to start now.#Maybe Shetland can do without Sullom Voe but the economy of Britain still depends on that. We need to bring it down and work on other solutions.#But I think the council does need to declare a climate emergency.#Questions were also raised on ferry links to the mainland, with concerns voiced about the number of cabins and the freight constraints.Ms Valente said the boats were #not fit for purpose,# and added capacity for freight was #dreadful#.Mr Robinson said Shetland should be able to design a ferry to suit its own needs. He said the real problems with NorthLink vessels lay at constraints at Aberdeen Harbour, as well as regulations which limited where on a vessel cabins could be placed.#To my mind we really should have the power locally to resolve our own ferry service, so we can design something that works for us.#Mr Flaws said the ferries were commissioned roughly  years ago. He said it was dficult for his family of five to get away on the ferry.#They#re just not fit for purpose. We need to say what we need rather than be told what we should be using.#Discussion also focused on the bus service, with support for cheaper – or even,possible, free – buses being offered.Mr Flaws said it would be good to see more people using buses.#If it was cheaper or free then maybe more folk would be using it. If that was an incentive to get more folk on it, then that should be looked at,# although he acknowledged some bus times did not suit everybody.Ms Valente cited an occasion when she lived in Sandveien when the bus could get her to work just before am.#They they changed the service, so that actually you either had to get to work by half eight or half nine. It#s just ridiculous. I do not know how that happened.#Mr Wenger said e-buses – smaller units which can be called upon using an app – should be adopted. He added he had enjoyed a positive experience with an electric bike.Mr Robinson – a convert to the bike himself – said there was no easy answer on buses.#The last thing you want to do is run a bus with three folk on it when in actual fact that#s causing a bigger carbon footprint than a car with three folk in it.#He berated the absence of any buses in Shetland that ran on anything other than diesel. He cited Dundee, which had a number of electric taxis.Questions were raised about how a councillor might get things discussed with other members.Mr Robinson said climate change was something he would consider attempting to raise a notice of motion over – a measure which would ensure the topic is debated in the chamber.#That is one thing the council has failed to move on so far. I suspectyou were to canvas the councillors and ask them to sign it, you#d probably get half the councillors for a start. I fail to understand why they#ve not moved on it. It#s ridiculous.#Mr Flaws said an issue that kept coming back was that people had no idea what the council#s strategy was with sustainable energy.#It#s Viking Energy, or it#s nothing,# he said.Ms Valente said she wanted to ensure everyone#s house was insulated.#There are people living in houses that are cold. There are people who can not afford to do it and are choosing between putting the heating on and having something to eat.#Mr Wenger said council office buildings should be insulated, but Ms Henderson said it was important to deal with the issues constituents bring forward. raquoInteresting, with fuel poverty so high on the agenda Gary Robinson wants to declare a #climate emergency# causing the SIC to spend scarce money on #tackling climate change#.

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Instead, it leads to the booze aisle in thelocal supermarket and to a drinking den out on the moor.In this, the maincharacter in Kevin MacNeil’s novel ‘The Stornoway Way’ is depicted as havingmuch in common with his fellow islanders, whether or not they absorb their localminister’s thunderous moralising. Theplay of the same name, which MacNeil also wrote, pulls no punches so far asdevastating social critique is concerned.There’s a lot in a name. RomanStornoway can be read as romance torn away. He is also R Stornoway. He is a religiouscuckoo in the nest and the key in a roman a clef. The character himselfacknowledges all this. As an everyman outsider, Mister S is meant tocommunicate a great deal about Lewis.Calvinism, alcohol and climatecombine in a pernicious cocktail that permeates people and place. Depression, repression and addiction are endemic.So are dreams of escape.If this is the desolate reality in which MacNeil’s characters are immersed, the play of the novel # staged by Dogstar Theatre at Sabhal Mor Ostaig last week # sugars the pill with scabrous wit, hilarious minor characters, and some truly moving songs, among them a traditional Gaelic lament rendered with crystalline clarity by Lewis-born actor Rachel Kennedy. It is a sublime moment where Roman reconnects with the culture he scorns. But the moment passes, and the song of loss and love is soon replaced with cynicism and tomorrow’s hangover.All good writing, whetherfor page or stage, interweaves the personal, the local and the universal. Roman’s war is with himself and with Lewishis dreams are of finding love and self-fulfilment. The universal arrives inthe shape of Eva, a Hungarian student who initially succumbs to Roman’s scatterguncharm, but who later comes to see him as self-obsessed and manipulative. Roman is certainly that. Heis also vulnerable, funny, and capable of great profundity.Self-fulfilment comesthrough music, and when Roman’s long-suffering best friend Eilidh organises asession for him in a recording studio in Edinburgh, the road to salvationopens. But Roman is a master at self-sabotage. Matters don’t quite go to plan.Naomi Stirrat as Roman,Rachel Kennedy as Eilidh and Chloe-Ann Tylor as Eva are all fine actors, and adeptat lively theatricality. As an ensemble,they tick like a Swiss watch, darting here and there without missing a beat. Andthey can’t half belt out a tune. As with all adaptations,there are issues concerning the episodic aspect of narrative fiction and how thisworks on stage, in real-time. In ‘The Stornoway Way’ scene transitions areheralded by brief drum patterns that wouldn’t sound out of place in an Americansitcom. But that is to cavil. MacNeil’s play is at least as good as his novel, and the novel was very good indeed."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LOCHALSH-MOD-19-KYLEAKIN-PS-1.jpg","title":"competition underway to create a flag for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoinen.This weeksees the launch of a competition to design a flag, which will be recognised by the Court of Lord Lyon — the body responsible for recording and protecting all heraldry, flags and national symbols in Scotland — and will be flown and displayed as an emblem of the island at home and abroad., Highland Council ward members and tourism body SkyeConnect petitioned the court with the idea for a flag following the example of several other island areas and regions which have, in recent years, adopted a flag.Philip Tibbetts, honorary vexillologist with the Court of the Lord Lyon, is to visit schools on the island next week to deliver a series of workshops and presentations detailing his interest in flags, and discussing the themes which could potentially inspire a flag for Skye.It is hoped youngsters and adults will be keen to have a go at designing the flag, and enter the competition which will run from st November until st December, after which a  — made up of representatives from throughout the community — will compile a short list of final entries which will then become subject of a public vote in February of next year.or by post to Skye Flag Competition, c o West Highland Free Press, Unit B, Pairc nan Craobh, Broadford, Isle of Skye IV AP, the potential for both the design and subsequent usage of a flag for the island is incredible.”In addition to the information provided on this page, these links will be helpful:"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LOVAT-STUART-MACDONALD-2-adj.jpg","title":"shinty hurling to take centre stage as scotland visit face ireland this","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTwo Kinlochshiel players, Finlay MacRae and Donald Nixon, are in the Scotland squad for the senior shinty-hurling match.At under- level Alan MacRae has named a -man squad seeking to seal a second win in succession against the Irish.Skye#s William MacKinnon is in line for his debut, while there is also a place in the squad for Johnnie MacAskill, the ex-Kinlochshiel player, now playing for Glasgow Mid Argyll.

Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her.Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she did it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family.Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care.This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  .We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us.This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby.We decided to host Rubys Birthday Fundraiser last year and it was a huge success, raising an amazing pound,. The whole community and local business were fully behind us and couldn’t have done it without them. The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions.The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.My goal in le is to keep Ruby’s memory alive and by holding her parties its raising money in Ruby’s name for the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice.We will be forever indebted to the Hospice for all the support they gave us during Ruby’s le with respite, end of le care and all the memories we created in Horizon House. I continue to tell my story of grief and Ruby’s le on my blog Chasingladybirds it has been a good way help journey through grief and to also reach out to others in the same situation.Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started.In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief.Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.Admission costs pound for adults and children go free. There will bouncing castles, soft play, face painting, nail painting, little gladiators, cake sale and a raffle with an array of great prizes,as well as Victoria Sponges with filled do-nuts.Raffle tickets cost pound a strip and can be purchased before the partythey can’t attend by contacting Lisa via Instagram: @chasingladybirds or Facebook: Lisa Powell.The fun kicks off at pm until pm and most importantly all money raised goes towards this vital cause - a poignant and fitting way to remember little Rubys legacy.

I really trust him and the cast can see how his mind works as a director.”Known for her comedic roles, Katie spoke of how it was great to sink her teeth into a dramatic role. “This is a real love story of a middle class Protestant who falls in love with an Irish rebel – and we’ll leave it there,” she laughed.“I don’t want to give too much away. Myself and fellow actor Maria Connolly are on stage the whole time, linking the threadsyou like. It is such a lovely piece of writing by Kate.“Kate’s son Sean, one of the forces behind the Dead Rabbit Bar in New York, will be offering an Irish coffee before the show courtesy of the bar as well. It is a very limited run, just over two nights, but it’s wonderful that audiences will be able to see Kate’s final work.”The piece, produced by GBL Productions’ Briege Lynch, is an emotional one for all involved as Briege said she knew Kate since she was four.“I’m very honoured to have Betrothed as my first producing credit,” she said. “I’ve known and loved Kate since I was four running in and out of the Community Arts Forum offices as a young child where my dad, Martin, was director and Kate was the administrator. I probably got under her feet a lot but she was always so kind and caring and would sneak me treats. I’m sad that she isn’t here to bask in the glory of getting this writing from the page to the stage.”Betrothed by Kate Muldoon runs at the Grand Opera House in the Baby Grand from November  and .

The event will also see launch of a groundbreaking new report that outlines a framework for community development.The paper, entitled ‘We Must Dissent’, is the result of a community survey that assessed the human rights of local residents against the major issues facing the area. Amongst the issues identied were concerns around road safety, housing, health, education, and unemployment.Another key issue was the pressures of commercial land speculation in the area, which has presented an obstacle to the community development of the Lanyon Tunnels.Despite planning permission and £.million being granted for the development, plans have been stalled by owners of an adjacent piece of land – which was subject to plans to build a £million office block.In , residents won a legal victory when the High Court ruled that planning approval for office block was unlawful. However, the potential for future plans to develop the land could impede access to the tunnelsgiven the go-ahead.Speaking ahead of next Wednesday’s event, Fionntán Hargey from the Market Development Association said the tunnels development would provide a “massive boost to people’s self esteem”.“It would physically reconnect them to city centre and it would also reconnect them into the economic, social and cultural le of Belfast. “The tunnels got planning permission in , and there is £. million in funding sitting there ready to go, and there are three groups of residents trained up and they’ve got business places developed. We also have updated drawings that have recently been commissioned. “The issue is that there is a private developer who is refusing to grant access to allow the project to go ahead.”He continued: “Next Wednesday will refresh people on the latest concept drawings and give people wider overview of the Redeveloping the Local Economy programme. Our aspiration is that by January we will be launching a report, and we will have several groups of residents with business ideas that are on course for development.” Next Wednesday’s event will take place at pm in the Market Community Centre where guest speaker, Dr Sean Byers, will discuss the economics of community empowerment. There will also be a full project update on the Lanyon Tunnels."},{"url":null,"title":"field of remembrance opens in belfast","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Unsurprisingly for Northern Ireland, Brexit has become entwined with the constitutional question, as the impasse over the withdrawal treaty distilled down to whether trade barriers would be erected on the Irish border or down the Irish Sea. The current deal, which proposed the latter solution, has angered unionists and loyalists, who claim it will undermine Northern Ireland’s place within the UK. Meanwhile, business and agricultural sectors have warned of potential catastrophic economic consequences of a no deal.Defend the UnionDeliver Brexit pic UADqVOC— DUPMay , Brexit has pushed the issue of Irish unity into the political mainstream – a development that has already heightened tensions around the election campaign. Northern Ireland voted Remain by % in the  referendum. Of the five parties with realistic chances of winning seats, the DUP is pro-Brexit Sinn Fein, the SDLP and Alliance are pro-Remain while the UUP’s incoming leader favours Remain over the current deal. The campaign could prove somewhat uncomfortable for the DUP, amid unionist fury about the Irish Sea border signed off by the party’s supposed Westminster ally, Boris Johnson.Pacts:Electoral alliances are nothing new in Northern Ireland but this time round the dynamic has been altered by Brexit. The Remain Leave fault line has prompted link-ups, whether official or unspoken, not seen in previous polls. Sinn Fein and the SDLP have both stepped aside in three constituencies in an effort to help pro-Remain candidates defeat DUP Brexiteers. The SDLP decision to not contest North Belfast for the first time in its history will aid Sinn Fein’s chances of unseating DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds. Sinn Fein has reciprocated in South Belfast, leaving the field to help the SDLP take another DUP seat. Both parties have stepped down in East Belfast and North Down – moves designed to help Alliance Party leader Naomi Long and independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon respectively.This is a once in a generation election. We need to maximise the number of pro-remain MPs and oust DUP Brexiteers. Sinn Féin wont contest South Belfast, East Belfast or North Down. #GE pic sNMZztmtK— Sinn FéinNovember , Conversely, Brexit had, for a time, looked like ending recent unionist co-operation in key marginals, when incoming Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken announced his intention to run in all  constituencies. Within a week however – and before Mr Aiken had even been formally elected leader – he went back on that pledge and said his party would now not stand in North Belfast, to help Mr Dodds’ chances. That move, along with the SDLP’s decision in the same constituency, has prompted claims of hypocrisy, given the UUP’s trenchant criticism of the DUP’s handling of Brexit and the SDLP’s vocal opposition to Sinn Fein’s Westminster abstentionist policy.The cross-community Alliance Party, which could contend for DUP seats in south and east Belfast, has refused to engage in any pacts, and will stand in all  constituencies.Abstentionism:Sinn Fein’s -year-old policy of not taking its seats at Westminster is always a hot topic come General Election time. However, Brexit, and in particular the kne-edge nature of some of the parliamentary votes, has increased focus on its abstentionist stance. Despite criticism from all the other main Stormont parties, Sinn Fein has shown absolutely no inclination to review its position, as it continues to maintain that Irish interests will never be protected in a British Parliament.Abortion:\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A silent demonstration at Stormont over the planned liberalisation of abortion laws in Northern Ireland Abortion was decriminalised in Northern Ireland last month as a consequence of legislation passed at Westminster in the ongoing absence of powersharing. The Government has now a responsibility to introduce abortion services in the region by next April. The emotive issue is highly isive in the region. In an unorthodox move, unionist MLAs last month convened a special sitting of the Assembly, despite there being no powersharing executive, in a bid to thwart the law change. With Sinn Fein and the SDLP opposing efforts to reconvene the legislature without a wider political deal to restore a coalition government, the attempt to stop decriminalisation failed. Sinn Fein and SDLP candidates are likely to face questions on the doorsteps from conservative supporters unhappy at the law change and could lose some votes to candidates with a strong anti-abortion stance, including those from the relatively new party Aontu.Powersharing:\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Powersharing in Northern Ireland collapsed almost three years ago The election will take place a month prior to the third anniversary of the collapse of powersharing. While the poll is ostensibly focused on Westminster issues, it will be seen by many as a proxy judgment on the malaise at Stormont. The smaller parties are pointing to the ongoing failure of the DUP and Sinn Fein to resurrect the institutions as a compelling reason to vote for an alternative."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38658717.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Sinn-fein-GElection_announcement_.jpg","title":"general election sinn fein pulls out of three constituencies in race for westminster seats","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She said their move was down to getting as many pro-remain MPs elected as possible and those candidates with a \"vision for a positive future\". “You can call this a pact, you can call it what you wish, the reality is that were asking people to come out and to vote for those pro-remain candidates,\" she added.\"This is in many ways a once in a generation election, the stakes are very high and people have a fundamental choice to make to vote for a positive, inclusive future or to turn their backs on that and back candidates who have been the architect for Brexit and acted very deliberately against the democratic wishes of people here in the north.“Over the last number of years we have worked closely with pro-remain parties and Michelle ONeill has led that effort.“We have been aware in Sinn Fein that we need to do everything we can to protect the interest of every citizen that lives here and that means respecting and standing up for the pro-remain position.“We believe that is the right thing to do and at the highest level that reflects the interests of people here in the north of Ireland.”Read MoreAlex Kane: It may be hung on Remain vs Leave, but the ‘pacts’ are just old-fashioned Orange vs GreenSDLP wont run in North Belfast setting up Dodds v Finucane showdown - and stands aside in two other constituenciesOn Monday morning the SDLP confirmed it will not be contesting North Belfast, East Belfast and North Down.Deputy leader Nichola Mallon would not be drawn onshe would herself, or advise others, to vote Sinn Fein in the constituency.\"Given the reality of our political situation,\" she said, \"We need to remove as much as possible the very toxic pro-Brexit, pro-Boris DUP MPs, who over their antics over the last two years have done nothing to represent the interests of the people of Northern Ireland.\"The move prompted former Lisburn councillor Mairia Cahill to quit the party over what she described as a \"grubby sectarian pact dressed up as a remain one\".It will be the first time in the SDLPs history that it will not be putting forward a candidate in North Belfast.MLA John Blair said the move \"reinforced\" the profile of the two main parties and \"contradicted\" what they had said on abstentionism and \"progressive pro-remain positions\".

This is a welcome development.\"It concluded by urging the Taoiseach to start planning for a united Ireland now.\"We ask the government to establish a Citizens Assembly reflecting the views of citizens North and South, or a Forum to discuss and achieve maximum consensus on a way forward.\""},{"url":null,"title":"jacob reesmogg apologises for grenfell common sense comments","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Derry News last week reported that the number of -hour computers at the Magee Campus in Derry has been reduced from  to  for the   academic year. Records reveal there are  workstations available at Coleraine on a -hour basis in its library. Meanwhile, UU’s Belfast campus has  computers and Jordanstown has  -hour computers with an additional  on offer until pm in its library. The most recent figures show Magee has , students, Coleraine ,, Jordanstown , and Belfast stood at , in   – but will rise dramatically once Jordanstown relocates to the city centre. googletag.cmd.push The % reduction in computers at Magee has been problematic for students with no computer or internet access at home and those in employment who must find time in the evenings and later at night to work on assignments. Ulster University says a decision was taken to reduce the number of -hour computers at Magee based on analysis of out-of-hours usage. However, a number of students studying at the Derry Campus have complained that every time they go to use one of the -hour computers none are available. Vice President of the Students’ Union at Magee, Collette Cassidy, confirmed that she had been made aware of the issue by students and has relayed these concerns to relevant staff at the university with a view to finding a solution. People Before Profit Cllr Shaun Harkin has called on Ulster University to reverse its decision on Magee computer provision. Students at Magee have contacted People Before Profit about the reduction of -hour computer facilities at Magee. They have been cut from  to . This means students cant access computers when they need one and the situation will become much worse during exams. “Anyone who doesnt have a computer at home or who doesnt have access to the internet has been impacted by this, this includes working parents. “No such cut has taken place in Coleraine or Belfast. The Coleraine campus has over  -hour computer facilities. As does Belfast. “Weve just had presentations to Derry and Strabane Council from top Ulster University officials claiming they have a full commitment to expanding Magee. Many people are alarmed Ulster University is set to suck up the bulk of promised City Deal funding. He added: “What sort of message does cutting computer access send to Magee students and people in the North West  It looks like a continuation of the treatment Ulster University and Stormont has dished out to Magee for the last sixty years. “We shouldnt stand for it. We are working with Magee students to demand this decision be reversed immediately. “This also means we have to once again question our trust in Ulster Universitys commitment to Derry and the broader region. “This is why Derry and Strabane Council has agreed to explore all available options when it comes to the development of the type of University we deserve here. This must be followed through on. The Derry University Group added that this confirms everything they have said about Magee being the fourth priority campus of Belfast’s second university. A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: “Computer provision on each campus is reviewed and adapted based on student feedback and demand.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

DUG states: “University provision is necessary to transform this. In the past three decades, Ireland’s other ‘Atlantic Coast’ cities - Cork, Galway and Limerick – have seen their student numbers soar in tandem with their local economies. “Derry Strabane has a total population of ,, with a third-level student population of, at best, ,. “Corkhas a population of , and, with the opening of a new campus in , will have a third-level student population of approximately , – ten times that of the North West. It has an outstanding reputation for its cultural, tourism and recreational facilities.”It says that Derry  Strabane Council’s Strategic Growth Plan is “entirely dependent” on university expansion which doesn’t seem to be forthcoming, with Derry’s student numbers, “already the worst on the island”, dropping again.Cold water has also been poured on Magee expansion by Head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, when he cast doubt over the long-promised Medical School build.Meanwhile, figures published by the Department for the Economyshow , NI students were in higher education in England, Scotland or Wales in  - a ten-year high.And according to the latest statistics, Derry Strabane is the only region of the North that is a net exporter of its young people.“UU has categorically failed to make any progress on its  promise to have , students at Magee by ,” the DUG says. googletag.cmd.push Curriculum Courses at a new independent university must, the group says, offer as broad an academic programme as is practical, reflecting the traditions, strengths and specialisms of the region within its curricula.Therefore, it envisages a full syllabus boasting courses in Medicine, Law, IT, Engineering, Arts, Commerce, but also specialise in and promote courses which are unique to Derry.Long-standing engineering traditions, evident in the City Walls and homegrown engineering companies such as EI, Seagate and InVistashould be reflected.In terms of innovation, Derry currently houses two science parks, conducting research in Articial Intelligence, robotics, virtual augmented reality. “It was the first Irish city to partner with MITto pursue research into D printing, currently running a number of Fab-Labs in schools and communities. “Thousands of people work in IT business support in the North West, with Pramerica employing , people in North Donegal.”There would also be courses in Irish History with Derry being Ireland’s longest continuously inhabited Christian settlement, and the region once home to a number of High Kings in the Middle Ages. These would be complemented by courses in Marine Military History.As a region “bursting with creative talent” Arts, Drama and Music courses are also high on the agenda.The document cites Derry’s reputation as an international leader in modern literature and conflict resolution - with Nobel laureates in both disciplines.Literature  Philosophy, Conflict Resolution  Trauma Relief, Conflict Journalism and Tourism  Heritage are amongst a plethora of subjects synonymous with the city which could be taught at an independent university. Bridging the border The DUG believes there is an urgent need to mitigate against Brexit by ‘bridging the border’ with a new independent university in the North West, recognised and supported by both the Irish EU and British governments, which would have “the freedom and autonomy to serve, andin, both jurisdictions.“Such a facility, centred in Derry, would immediately establish a partnership with the existing Letterkenny Institute of Technology, less than  miles away. The parent university could apply to become a constituent member of both the National University of Ireland and Universities UK. “This would allow it to benefit from both organisations’ administrative expertise. Formal links with southern institutions would, moreover, solidy the European identity of Northern students and, post Brexit, would help protect the rights of Irish citizens in the North as per the Good Friday Agreement.“It is time to renew and regenerate our powerful scholastic legacy. It is time to repudiate the Lockwood Report and correct this historical travesty by immediately establishing a new, independent university.”The Derry University Group has lobbied London, Dublin and US government officials calling for the establishment of a new city-region university. It has made presentations to the Irish government calling for the new university to become a constituent of the National University of Ireland. The group has received official recognition from Derry City and Strabane District Council and the international Derry-Donegal diaspora association Futureproof North West.In , following visits to the North West by the British Labour peer Andrew Adonis and frontbench MPs Mike Amesbury and Mike Kane, Lord Adonis told the Upper House that the decision to deny Derry a standalone university was a “scandal”. He also called for a review of Higher Education provision in the North which has since been published.

DUG states: “University provision is necessary to transform this. In the past three decades, Ireland’s other ‘Atlantic Coast’ cities - Cork, Galway and Limerick – have seen their student numbers soar in tandem with their local economies. “Derry Strabane has a total population of ,, with a third-level student population of, at best, ,. “Corkhas a population of , and, with the opening of a new campus in , will have a third-level student population of approximately , – ten times that of the North West. It has an outstanding reputation for its cultural, tourism and recreational facilities.”It says that Derry  Strabane Council’s Strategic Growth Plan is “entirely dependent” on university expansion which doesn’t seem to be forthcoming, with Derry’s student numbers, “already the worst on the island”, dropping again.Cold water has also been poured on Magee expansion by Head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, when he cast doubt over the long-promised Medical School build.Meanwhile, figures published by the Department for the Economyshow , NI students were in higher education in England, Scotland or Wales in  - a ten-year high.And according to the latest statistics, Derry Strabane is the only region of the North that is a net exporter of its young people.“UU has categorically failed to make any progress on its  promise to have , students at Magee by ,” the DUG says. googletag.cmd.push Curriculum Courses at a new independent university must, the group says, offer as broad an academic programme as is practical, reflecting the traditions, strengths and specialisms of the region within its curricula.Therefore, it envisages a full syllabus boasting courses in Medicine, Law, IT, Engineering, Arts, Commerce, but also specialise in and promote courses which are unique to Derry.Long-standing engineering traditions, evident in the City Walls and homegrown engineering companies such as EI, Seagate and InVistashould be reflected.In terms of innovation, Derry currently houses two science parks, conducting research in Articial Intelligence, robotics, virtual augmented reality. “It was the first Irish city to partner with MITto pursue research into D printing, currently running a number of Fab-Labs in schools and communities. “Thousands of people work in IT business support in the North West, with Pramerica employing , people in North Donegal.”There would also be courses in Irish History with Derry being Ireland’s longest continuously inhabited Christian settlement, and the region once home to a number of High Kings in the Middle Ages. These would be complemented by courses in Marine Military History.As a region “bursting with creative talent” Arts, Drama and Music courses are also high on the agenda.The document cites Derry’s reputation as an international leader in modern literature and conflict resolution - with Nobel laureates in both disciplines.Literature  Philosophy, Conflict Resolution  Trauma Relief, Conflict Journalism and Tourism  Heritage are amongst a plethora of subjects synonymous with the city which could be taught at an independent university. Bridging the border The DUG believes there is an urgent need to mitigate against Brexit by ‘bridging the border’ with a new independent university in the North West, recognised and supported by both the Irish EU and British governments, which would have “the freedom and autonomy to serve, andin, both jurisdictions.“Such a facility, centred in Derry, would immediately establish a partnership with the existing Letterkenny Institute of Technology, less than  miles away. The parent university could apply to become a constituent member of both the National University of Ireland and Universities UK. “This would allow it to benefit from both organisations’ administrative expertise. Formal links with southern institutions would, moreover, solidy the European identity of Northern students and, post Brexit, would help protect the rights of Irish citizens in the North as per the Good Friday Agreement.“It is time to renew and regenerate our powerful scholastic legacy. It is time to repudiate the Lockwood Report and correct this historical travesty by immediately establishing a new, independent university.”The Derry University Group has lobbied London, Dublin and US government officials calling for the establishment of a new city-region university. It has made presentations to the Irish government calling for the new university to become a constituent of the National University of Ireland. The group has received official recognition from Derry City and Strabane District Council and the international Derry-Donegal diaspora association Futureproof North West.In , following visits to the North West by the British Labour peer Andrew Adonis and frontbench MPs Mike Amesbury and Mike Kane, Lord Adonis told the Upper House that the decision to deny Derry a standalone university was a “scandal”. He also called for a review of Higher Education provision in the North which has since been published.

Stephen’s family accepted a request from the College to rename the Year  Class League, which Stephen had been a winning captain of in , in Stephen’s memory.  Presentation of the Shield with Conor Glass, the Quinn family and organiser Mr William McAteer.  The traditional setting of the day of the Halloween holidays has since become Stephen Quinn Shield Final day. As ever this year’s final was a very exciting final, battled out by two teams who had met in the group stages when Pt had come out on top in a high scoring encounter. googletag.cmd.push With the full Year  cohort of pupils giving excellent support Ti opened brightly with Dara O’Kane, Daragh O’Neill and Ruairi Biggs all to the fore. Ryan McGrath was excellent in goals while Danny Mc Goldrick was very solid in defence. Pt though worked their way back in to the game after the early onslaught and as the half wore on they had a lot of play but couldn’t manage to get the crucial scores, despite hitting the woodwork on two occasions and seeing two other goal chances go agonisingly close to the major they needed. Daire Hull, Leon Woods, Jack Rodgers and Corie McKay were proper driving forces for the underdogs while Dara Hassan was excellent in goals but the absence of Padraig O Kane from full back was a huge loss to their team. This was more keenly felt as the underdogs tired through the second-half and it was Ti who finished strongly to send joint captains Dara O’Kane and Daragh O’Neill up to collect the much coveted Stephen Quinn Shield. The Quinn family were present to hand over the Shield and they were joined by another previous winning captain of the event and St Patrick’s legend, Conor Glass, revisiting the St Mary Building while on holidays from his professional career with Hawthorn in Australia. “The College would like to thank the Quinn family for their unwavering support of the event and for being in attendance to do the presentation,” commented Paul Hughes. “Thanks also to Mr William McAteer who organised and ran a fantastic event and to Conor Glass for attending the event. Finally of course a huge well done to all the Year  pupils who took part over many lunch times in the past few weeks.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He set up the #lovemakesaway movement and the First Home Project.Cathleen Falsani is a writer who has just released an acclaimed new book End Of Hunger. In the past she has interviewed the likes of Barack Obama and Bono.Jonny Clark is the producer of s Of The Flame and is the leader of Youth With A Mission in Ireland and runs a Reconciliation centre in Rostrevor, County Down called An Cuan.Jonny, Jarrod and Cathleen have been walking the Border since the supposed Brexit Day of st October to be a presence of peace and reconciliation in the communities along the route.Also speaking at the Bellaghy event will be Eugene Reavey.Two of Eugene’s brothers, John Martin , Brianwere shot dead by UVF gunmen who burst into their Co Armagh home on  January .His brother Anthonywas also shot and died later in hospital.

Under a ‘totting-up’ system, a driver who accumulates  or more penalty points within a three year period is liable to be disqualied from driving for six months. If they are disqualied a second time, they cannot drive for a year.However, the Driver and Vehicle Agency say that it “does not have the power to disqualy a person from driving” and that “a disqualication can only be ordered by the court.” This means that motorists can remain on the road despite having a large number of penalty points.In response to an Freedom of Informationrequest from the County Derry Post, the Driver and Vehicle Agencyrevealed that ten drivers in the county have  penalty points on their licence, one motorist have  and two drivers have  points. The DVA has not revealedall  drivers have been disqualied. Recent figures have shown that more than , motorists in the UK continue to drive with  or more penalty points. This includes a -year-old Burnley woman who has  points on her licence, a -year-old Kent man with  points and a Bradford manwho has the worst record in the UK with  penalty points. Road safety charity IAM RoadSmart says that it has been calling for the government to take action on this issue for six years and is “highly concerned” at the number of motorists that remain on the road with so many penalty points.Neil Greig, IAM RoadSmart director of policy and research, said that action must be taken “to get irresponsible and dangerous drivers off our roads.” “Licences need to be removed and drivers who have committed repeat offences encouraged to take remedial courses to bring home the impact of the impact of their behaviour and promote safer, more responsible driving behaviour in future,” he said. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Under a ‘totting-up’ system, a driver who accumulates  or more penalty points within a three year period is liable to be disqualied from driving for six months. If they are disqualied a second time, they cannot drive for a year.However, the Driver and Vehicle Agency say that it “does not have the power to disqualy a person from driving” and that “a disqualication can only be ordered by the court.” This means that motorists can remain on the road despite having a large number of penalty points.In response to an Freedom of Informationrequest from the County Derry Post, the Driver and Vehicle Agencyrevealed that ten drivers in the county have  penalty points on their licence, one motorist have  and two drivers have  points. The DVA has not revealedall  drivers have been disqualied. Recent figures have shown that more than , motorists in the UK continue to drive with  or more penalty points. This includes a -year-old Burnley woman who has  points on her licence, a -year-old Kent man with  points and a Bradford manwho has the worst record in the UK with  penalty points. Road safety charity IAM RoadSmart says that it has been calling for the government to take action on this issue for six years and is “highly concerned” at the number of motorists that remain on the road with so many penalty points.Neil Greig, IAM RoadSmart director of policy and research, said that action must be taken “to get irresponsible and dangerous drivers off our roads.” “Licences need to be removed and drivers who have committed repeat offences encouraged to take remedial courses to bring home the impact of the impact of their behaviour and promote safer, more responsible driving behaviour in future,” he said. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

New projects this year included social prescribing mdash helping people who present to their local GP to get out and about in their local area.New investment in multi-disciplinary teams in GP practices in Down was now being rolled out to the rest of Newry and Mourne. He said the Network was central to that roll-out and CDRCNrsquos experience of social prescribing made the organisation a great source of referrals to local community activities.Cllr Casey said CDRCN along with Community Advice and other umbrella support organisations were key to the delivery of Council services.

We are being terrorised in our homes and our property is being damaged.Mrs Smyth said it was almost impossible to report incidents to the police.ldquoIf we can get through the police often donrsquot respond, she continued. ldquoThese temporary gates have been being put up for almost two years now. Torn down and put up again. Itrsquos the residents who suffer, not the council people for delays in signing off on the workthat needs to be done.The residents are being supported by local Independent councillor Cadogan Enright, who accused the council of being ldquonot exactly on top of their game.He said: ldquoThe need for fences and gates to make the area into a cul-de-sacs was triggered by an emergency situation where pensioners were and still are under siege by a small number of nersquoer-do-wells, culminating with the actual burning down of a pensionerrsquos cottage.ldquoThe council have not been treating this as an emergency. Were it not for the Housing Executive repeatedly replacing the eight temporary steel and wood barriers week after week when they are torn down, the area would be unviable as an area where pensioners can live.He added: ldquoI have proposed a workshop between the social partners led by the PSNI, Housing Executive, council and other partners to agree in detail a step-by-step process for gating orders in writing so that we never again have such a series of dreadful delays.A spokesman for the council said last night: Newry, Mourne and Down District Council can advise that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has applied to the council for gating orders in the Model Farm area and that the Council is currently following gating order guidance produced by the Department of the Environment.ldquoThis process requires consultation with the Department for Infrastructure and members of the public in the area.

We will eventually cover all old estates, subject to continuing funds and satisfactory contracts.Movements have already been made with the awarding of a number of pre-paint repair contracts and work on all contracts should begin by March or April next year.More programmes of maintenance work are being prepared and will be starting in the - financial year, subject to the approval of the Executiversquos Board.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Uncertainty has surrounded the recent proposals to establish units for educationally sub-normal pupils at Castlewellan.The South Eastern Education and Library Board give approval in January for two new units to be set up at the local controlled primary school.However, plans were revised when the neighbouring school, St Malachyrsquos Primary, decided it wanted to have special ESN units.Board officers decided thatan ESN unit is established at St Malachyrsquos the demand for ESN facilities at Castlewellan Primary mightand therefore only one unit might be necessary at each school.But confusion arose when the Board placed advertisements in a local newspaper about the plans to establish the units.Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, was unsure about whether or not the Board had changed its policy and was intended to establish the units at St Malachyrsquos instead of at the controlled school.Mrs Smyth, who has raised the matter on several occasions, told Board members, this week that she was aggrieved about the whole affair and thought that Board officers had acted in a ldquovery surreptitious manner.ldquoThis sort of thing raises suspicions in the community and itrsquos just not good enough,: said Mrs Smyth.However, she was assured by Board chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, that Board officers had not acted in an underhand manner and that there had only been a misunderstanding.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh priest had called this week for people to follow the example of friendship shown by more than  Protestants and Roman Catholics who joined together in a special Halloween dinner and concert organised by his church.He is Fr Hugh OrsquoHagan and he was speaking hours after  senior citizens had enjoyed a dinner and concert in St Maryrsquos Hall, organised by the hall management committee.Speaking afterwards Fr OrsquoHagan said that Killyleagh and Shrigley had a unique community, ldquo everywhere has like here, Northern Ireland would be a more peaceful place.Invitations to Thursdayrsquos dinner and concert went out to both sides of the community and Fr OrsquoHagan stressed that he hoped no senior citizen had been forgotten, either Protestant or Roman Catholic.The idea of the dinner mdash which was such a success last year, when he was held for the first time mdash has been widely praised in the town, especially by the senior citizens and Thursday nightrsquos was no exception, with many voting it a big hit.Before the dinner began, Fr OrsquoHagan mdash who has been priest in Killyleagh for over  years and who is the longest serving priest ever in the town mdash welcomed everyone and thanked them for coming.He welcomed especially, the three ministers in the town, the Rev J C Boggs, Rev J D Mark and Rev R E Conn.

preparing to import the generic drug from South America as part of a CF Buyers Club of families.In a desperate attempt to start their son on the drug as quickly as possible, the couple and their family fundraised around pound, to buy Lorcaacuten three months treatment.ldquoWe were so close to getting the generic drug ourselves and that would have been great as Lorcaacuten would have started on it, but we would have still been campaigning and pushing for it, said Jen.ldquoWe have been told that the Department of Health want to copy what NHS England did and get the drug into peoplersquos

and will feature classic songs such as Any Dream Will Do and Close Every Door To Me.Such success has been long on the cards for the Crossgar man who distinguished himself as one of the upcoming stars

Declan has lived with locked-in syndrome ever since.A video of Mark singing Take Him Home from the musical Les Miserables to Declan went viral in , landing him a spot on The Nolan Show.The emotional rendition of the song, which touches Declan and his parents every time they hear it, and the simple story of the brothersrsquo love and devotion, led to further performances for Mark on RTE.However, it wasnrsquot until this June that he won hearts as the runner-up in Britainrsquos Got Talent.His performance wowed judge Simon Cowell who told him it was the best performance of the series.Despite losing out to  year-old Cha Pensioner Colin Thackery, Markrsquos showcase on the hit show led to musical producers noticing his talent and superb voice.The McMullan family managed to keep the exciting news quiet until last week.Father John explained: ldquoMark was approached by the producer several months ago but we couldnrsquot really say anything.

The choral society gave me a taste for musical theatre and my mum really pushed me to do it.

Leading a presentation on Agriculture and Agri-food, Craig Humes highlighted how dairy farmers will be one of the main farming groups to be ldquostruck by Brexit.ldquo. billion litres of milk are collected from across Northern Irish farms each year.  per cent of this milk produced is then exported south to be processed.ldquoThis could make le extremely dficult for farmersexport tarfs are to be introduced, Craig shared, adding that Dr. Mike Johnston, Chief Executive of the Dairy Council Northern Ireland believes that milk prices could drop by  pence per litre should a no-deal Brexit proceed with such excessive tarfs announced.ldquoIn my opinion, to put it quite simply, dairy farmers will not survive in Fermanagh unless there is a deal, commented Craig.In her presentation on Tourism and Hospitality Rebekah Starrett noted how Fermanagh had over , visitors last year who spent an average of pound. million.ldquoThis is a massive amount of money being spent in this local economy. The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things. Brexit has taught me the importance of ensuring that my opinion and voice is heard, especially, when I wasnrsquot the age to vote in the  referendum.ldquoWhilst much of what happens around Brexit is beyond our control one thing for sure is that the potential impact will affect all of our lives. Whatever that may be, it is important that we as students embrace it and make the most of it, he added.Will Greenaway closed the conference by reiterating the potential benefits that could come from Brexit and potential concerns that leaving the EU could have on us in Northern Ireland and especially in Fermanagh.ldquoOur generation of students represent the future of Northern Ireland we are potentially the next generation of business leaders, health care workers and entrepreneurs.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although Alliance may not win seats in December, it may be the biggest long-term winner from the new political landscape.IRA and INLA left out of paramilitary ’s report Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Alliance has already been growing rapidly in recent years and made a signicant breakthrough earlier this year when for the first time its leader Noami Long took one of the two unionist MEP seats in an election which saw Northern Ireland elect one unionist, one nationalist and one who is constitutionally unaligned.SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon defended her party’s decision to stand aside in favour of Sinn Fein.She said: “This election is all about stopping Brexit and stopping Boris. It’s about Leave versus Remain. We have taken a very dficult and uncomfortable decision but a very pragmatic one in this election because we need to elect as many Remain MPs as possible who are going to take their seats and vote against Brexit.“But the reality is that we need to also do what we can to remove the very toxic influence of pro-Brexit, pro-Boris DUP MPs.”She insisted that “honestly, this is not a pact” and that “no party will have been aware of us taking this decision”. However, former high-profile SDLP councillor Mairia Cahill rejected that explanation and resigned from the SDLP in response to what she described as “a grubby sectarian pact dressed up as a remain one”.In announcing Sinn Fein’s decision, party leader Mary Lou McDonald urged the electorate to vote for “the pro-Remain candidates best placed to win the seats”. She added: “The recent EU election showed there is an appetite among pro-Remain and progressive voters for increasing co-operation between those who represent the majority who voted to stay in the EU.”try catch  TrendingMother tells of agony after sons body found -

partys decision to stand aside in three constituencies in Northern Ireland. Announcing the move in Belfast, party president Mary Lou McDonald also urged voters to back the SDLPs Claire Hanna in South Belfast and Alliance Party leader Naomi Long in East Belfast.The move came hours after the SDLP announced it would stand aside in three seats as well, again to facilitate Remainers in their efforts to beat DUP candidates..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The nationalist party will not put forward candidates in North and East Belfast and North Down.The move in North Belfast will give Sinn Fein candidate John Finucane a better chance of unseating DUP deputy leader and long-standing MP Nigel Dodds, who has a majority of just over ,.Outlining Sinn Feins decision on Monday afternoon, Ms McDonald said: \"In many ways this is a once-in-a-generation election, the stakes are very high in this election.\"People have a fundamental choice to make - to vote for a positive, inclusive future or to turn their backs on that and to back candidates who have been the architects of Brexit and who have acted very, very deliberately against the democratic wishes of people here in the north and more fundamentally against the economic and social interests of citizens who live here.\"She added: \"The reality is we are asking people to come out and vote for those pro-Remain candidates. We believe that is the right and progressive thing to do.\"Ms McDonald said it sat comfortably with her to urge Sinn Fein supporters to vote for a unionist.\"It sits very comfortably with me to ask and invite voters to thoughtfully do the right thing,\" she said.\"And in this case it means defying hard Brexiteers, the likes of Nigel Dodds, the likes of the DUP candidates who have very, very recklessly acted against the interests of everybody.\"Whether you call yourself a unionist or a nationalist, a republican or a loyalist, we actually have many, many interests in common.\"Steve Aiken U-turns to back unionist unity,  days after ruling it out Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The SDLP decision not to field a candidate in North Belfast for the first time in the partys history has prompted claims of hypocrisy from political rivals, given the SDLPs vocal criticism of Sinn Feins Westminster abstentionist policy in other battleground constituencies, such as Foyle.Former SDLP councillor Mairia Cahill resigned from the party in protest at the move, accusing the party of facilitating a \"sectarian headcount\".The SDLP said it had taken an \"extraordinary decision\" for an \"extraordinary election\".\"We have taken a unilateral decision not to stand candidates in North Down, North Belfast and East Belfast,\" said the party.\"Our first priority is to elect pro-Remain MPs to vote against Brexit and Boris Johnson but removing pro-Brexit MPs in Belfast is also critical.\"The Ulster Unionist Party has already stepped aside in North Belfast to give Mr Dodds a better chance of winning.The UUP decision also proved controversial, as it came only a week after incoming leader Steve Aiken pledged to run in all  constituencies in Northern Ireland. He has been accused of a major U-turn before he has even been officially elected as leader.Police are investigating alleged paramilitary threats made to the party in the wake of Mr Aikens initial pledge.The absence of SDLP and Sinn Fein candidates in East Belfast is designed to give Ms Long a better chance of defeating incumbent DUP MP Gavin Robinson, while in North Down the parties hope independent unionist and pro-Remain MP Lady Sylvia can see off a DUP challenge.Sinn Feins standing aside in South Belfast will strengthen SDLP candidate Ms Hannas chance of beating sitting DUP MP Emma Little-Pengelly.At the weekend the DUP announced it would continue its recent policy of not contesting Fermanagh and South Tyrone -

Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done.

However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Each beep of a passing horn or donation of coffee and pastries has encouraged our members to stand firm.“Following today’saction, both parties will participate in talks at the Labour Relations Agency where Unite will engage constructively and in good faith. No one should be in any doubt: our members remain determined to use the kind of strength and solidarity displayed today to defend their and their families’ living standards”, Mr Hewitt said.There had been a disagreement over the numbers who went on strike with the union claiming  were out but a company source saying that of the  workers only  voted to strike.Mr Hewitt had earlier said the strike on Monday is the first in a series of planned stoppages with pickets placed at the gates from am.Mr Hewitt said: “Low-paid ABP workers in Lurgan cannot avoid their family responsibilities – and the new sht times will make it almost impossible for them to make childcare arrangements.The offer of a derisory pay increase while also seeking to impose anti-family sht starts is an insult to a committed workforce which has built the success of ABP.Management’s aggressive approach has left the workers with no option but to take strike action.“If they want to ensure that production lines run smoothly in the run-up to Christmas, management needs to come to the table with realistic pay increases which reflect our members’ living costs, and they need to engage in meaningful discussions with the workers on sht times. ABP should be in no doubt that our members are determined to defend their and their families’ living standards”, Mr Hewitt said.A factory source said the firm had been in negotiations with UNITE since February .It is understood the company was asked by the union on Friday night at . that it wanted to enter into negotiations through the LRA and ABP agreed to this in the understanding that strike action would be removed.While the talks were scheduled for today Monday th November at the office of the LRA, it is understood the union proposed further action on Friday th November .A source said: “All negotiations should be in good faith, therefore the company cannot negotiate whilst there is a threat of industrial action.” The company also had disputed the numbers on industrial action. The source said: “We have  colleagues on the shop floor and of those  voted for industrial action which is only % of our workforce.”Regarding employee start times, which has been one of the reasons for the dispute, the firm said it had worked ‘exhaustively with the shop stewards and the union to reach an agreement’.A source within the firm said: “The company has already compromised on a number of occasions and we see our offer as fair and reasonable and this had been endorsed by the union at the time.“We took on board your comments in relation to the .am start after engaging with staff who had concerns and proposed a .am start.We also consulted with the local childcare facilities and had made arrangements to facilitate this.”In a statement last nightan ABP spokesperson said: “It was always ABP’s position to engage fully in conciliation talks through the Labour Relations Agency in good faith and we now look forward to doing that.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business.

It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference.

The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre.

We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business.
