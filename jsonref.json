In Islam we try to avoid too much mixing.\u0027Kickboxing is a contact sport, where you\u0027re literally hugging each other. So it was important for us to make it segregated. We did it and it really took off.\u0027            Mrs Safari (pictured left) teaches both Muslim and non-Muslim women, whose classes are segregated from her husband Master Karim\u0027s all-male classes (he is pictured right) The mother-of-five says she gets a mixed reaction from parents of youngsters who want to train and others outside her community.She said: \u0027Lots of people who view it negatively ask me \u0027how can you encourage this? \u0027Encourage Muslims segregating themselves from society?\u0027\u0027But I\u0027m actually doing the opposite. I\u0027m encouraging Muslim women to mix with non-Muslim women.   Christia Kyprianou, 33, was trained by Khadijah Safari to teach Muay Thai and kickboxing. She now has her own women-only sessions in south London Khadijah Safari has been training people in Muay Thai and Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) for nearly a decade.The now 36-year-old decided to join forces with her husband Karim, setting up their own martial arts school.But soon after starting classes in Fulham, south west London, they decided to segregate them.Mrs Safari, who now lives in Milton Keynes, has trained nine other female instructors to follow in her footsteps, including Christia Kyprianou.Ms Kyprianou, 33, of east London, teaches her own women-only sessions across the capital.She says: \u0027People are really shocked when you\u0027re a female instructor who teaches Muay Thai, let alone a Muslim female instructor.\u0027What made me stick at the training was the intensity of the training.\u0027The effect it had on my health and my cardio. The fact that it was lethal, that I could use my elbows, I could use my knees, I could use every part of my body as a weapon.\u0027I got pretty good at it and I get to train, teach and empower women and help people, it\u0027s literally my dream job.\u0027 Ms Kyprianou took to Muay Thai after trying out several other martial arts.          Ms Kyprianou is pictured training at a gym in Fulham, south west London She saw the Safaris teaching a class in London before they stopped being mixed and decided to join in.After an intense training programme, she is now qualified to teach full-time.She told MailOnline: \u0027I train women only from all backgrounds and faiths, however we tend to bring in a lot of Muslim women.  \u0027I think that it\u0027s imperative that all women, regardless of faith, are able to defend themselves.\u0027Ms Kyprianou was brought up in a Christian family but later converted to Islam and has worn the hijab ever since.Now she dreams of opening up her own organisation that helps empower women through sport and self defence.             Empowering women: Khadijah Safari (right) and Christia Kyprianou (right) both want to help women feel more confident by equipping them with self defence skills                                                     She explains: \u0027I\u0027ve never been physically attacked but once I was in Chelsea once and a man wound down his window and threw a sandwich at me. \u0027It missed but he said: \u0027Go back to your f***ing country.\u0027But she says she was confused about which \u0027country\u0027 he meant, having been born into a white British family in Buckinghamshire.She added: \u0027I thought, what country? I\u0027m British, I was born here, my mother\u0027s last name is Smith.     \u0027People ask me where I\u0027m from and I say I\u0027m British and they ask, \u0027But where are you really from?\u0027 - expecting to hear that I\u0027m from Pakistan or an Arab country.\u0027When I say England they look at me baffled. \u0027I had someone in a shop come over to me in a shop once and speak to me really slowly like I didn\u0027t understand English and I was like, \u0027I\u0027m fine thanks.\u0027  The kickboxing instructor (pictured) says people often assume she teaches primary school children - not martial arts As a student in London meeting people from different backgrounds, Mrs Safari researched several world religions, before focusing solely on Islam.She decided to read up on the aspects of the religion that received the most negative attention in the media.She said: \u0027My idea of religion was that it controlled people and it caused wars.\u0027I had the stereotypical view of Islam. 911 has not long happened when I moved to London and I was very aware of the image Islam had.\u0027But at uni most of my friends were Muslim. I didn\u0027t know they were at first because they didn\u0027t wear the hijab, but I found myself drawn to them.\u0027I didn\u0027t like drinking and didn\u0027t want to spend all of my Saturdays hungover - I liked being out training and using my time wisely.\u0027When one of my friends gave me a copy of the Koran I read that God isn\u0027t a he or a she, we only say he because it would be disrespectful to call God \u0027it\u0027.\u0027So I started to think of God as a force rather than a person - a force that had always been inside of me anyway.\u0027Then it all started to piece together perfectly. \u0027I read up on the negative things people said about Islam. I had heard about suicide bombers and read in the Koran that Islam forbids people to do that.          Khadijah Safari (pictured right) has trained Christia Kyprianou (left) so she can share her passion for self defence with other women too With Safari Kickboxing well established in her home town, as well as travelling up and down the country to give workshops and seminars, Mrs Safari is training other women to do what she does.She has already successfully mentored nine other instructors, including Christia Kyprianou, who teaches her own women-only classes in south London.Ms Kyprianou, 33, says: \u0027People are really shocked when you\u0027re a female instructor who teaches Muay Thai, let alone a Muslim female instructor.\u0027What made me stick at the training was the intensity of the training.\u0027The effect it had on my health and my cardio.

Taiwan\u0027s President Tsai Ing-wen has called on Beijing to respect \u0027freedom and democracy\u0027\u0027It\u0027s rather empty and doesn\u0027t have any new points except that cross-strait unification would not affect the interests of other countries,\u0027 said Fan Shih-ping, political analyst at National Taiwan Normal University, adding that Xi\u0027s words may also be intended for the US, which views Taiwan as part of its Indo-Pacific strategy.In 2018, the US sent multiple ships through the Taiwan Strait -- which China considers its territory but the US and others see as international waters open to all -- infuriating Beijing.Washington also remains Taipei\u0027s most powerful unofficial ally and its main arms supplier despite switching diplomatic recognition to Beijing in 1979.Xi\u0027s speech is likely to be \u0027very poorly received,\u0027 by the US, said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, who studies Chinese foreign policy.To accommodate differences in Taiwan\u0027s political system and civil society, China has proposed adopting the \u0027one country, two systems\u0027 policy, which was implemented in Hong Kong after the British handed the city back to China in 1997.But some say the erosion of civil liberties in Hong Kong sets a negative precedent for Taiwan.\u0027They (China) are gobbling up Hong Kong, not just politically but culturally and economically too\u0027, Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy Hong Kong lawmaker, told AFP.\u0027It\u0027s so obvious that they\u0027re trying to assimilate Hong Kong into wider mainland China in every way. How would any Taiwanese think that\u0027s going to work for them?\u0027Others believed Taiwanese could slowly come on board.\u0027People\u0027s heart won\u0027t change in one day, but I think one country, two systems is a way to do it. The unification might take one, two, or even three more generations to achieve,\u0027 said a 55-year old construction worker in Hong Kong who gave his surname as Lam.  Mid-term polls in 2018 delivered a massive defeat to Tsai\u0027s DPP, which has taken a hard line on relations with BeijingLast October, tens of thousands of Taiwan independence campaigners took to the streets in the first large-scale protest calling for an outright independence vote since the island first became a democracy more than 20 years ago.But some in Taiwan say worsening relations with Beijing have harmed business, as cuts to pensions and a reduction in public holidays compound frustrations over a stagnant economy where salaries have not kept up with the rise in cost of living.Last year, Taiwan\u0027s ruling party suffered a massive defeat in mid-term polls, causing Tsai to resign as leader of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, while the main opposition Kuomintang, which oversaw an unprecedented thaw with Beijing before Tsai took office in 2016, made gains.Beijing has adopted a multi-pronged approach to diminish Taiwan\u0027s presence on the international stage in recent years, including blocking it from global forums and poaching its dwindling number of official diplomatic allies."},{"url":null,"title":"Temperatures plunge low 6C overnight","story":"    Surfers in the morning sun at Tynemouth beach on the North East coast today          A solitary daffodil blooms on a roundabout near the Long Walk in Windsor, Berkshire, this morning          Stormy weather today in Seaburn, a seaside resort in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, as waves crash into the shoreThis is where the temperature suddenly rises high up in the stratosphere, between six and 30 miles above the North Pole, and it can result in a chain reaction that leads to very cold conditions from eastern Europe and Russia. Today, the mercury is not expected to climb far above 0C (32F) throughout the day in many areas and is due to remain in single figures celsius across the country. Brrrrrrring on 2019!

These are the most basic packages offered by energy companies, and tend to apply if you haven’t shopped around for a better deal.Crucially, it won’t cap someone’s total bill – it only limits the price a supplier can charge per kWh of electricity and gas used. It has initially been set at £1,137 a year for a dual-fuel customer who uses a typical amount of gas and electricity and pays by direct debit. Ofgem will update the cap in April and October every year to reflect the latest estimated costs of supplying gas and electricity.No – if you are eligible, you don’t need to do anything. Ofgem said the cap would give 11 million customers a fairer deal.Your bills will fall if you are on a poor-value standard variable or default deal, because suppliers must cut their prices to the level of, or below, the cap. But the amount you pay also depends on how much gas or electricity you use – if you use more energy, your bill will go up. Many commentators predict that in February Ofgem will announce an increase in the level of the cap to take effect on 1 April. With wholesale prices having risen significantly in recent months, people on standard and default tariffs could be hit with an increase.Citizens Advice said that while people on default tariffs would now pay a fairer price for their energy, “they will still be better off if they shop around”. Comparethemarket said that on average, customers who switched paid £921 a year on a dual-fuel fixed tariff – £216 less than the cap level.No, it’s due to end by 2023. Ofgem said that by then it expected other reforms and advances, such as faster switching times and smart meters, to bring about easier and fairer access to better deals. “It will be up to the government to consider if the market is working well enough for the cap to be removed,” it added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e42c99ca3289e61c97739fc90d876970ec453e41/0_13_2985_1791/master/2985.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b24e10fb1bc43ca0fe91460f2da093f0","title":"tell us how would a no deal brexit impact your business","story":"What issues do you anticipate for your business or sector should the UK leave the EU without a deal?Government ministers released a batch of papers in September warning of the risks of leaving the European Union without a deal.Impact papers stressed some of the day-to-day effects after Theresa May chaired a special meeting of the cabinet focused on how a no-deal outcome could be handled.We would like to hear from you if you work in a sector you think may be affected by a no-deal Brexit and to find out what the potential impact would mean for you.Tell us a little about what you do and how your reading of the situation means your business or sector could be affected in our encrypted form below.

Hope this will make your 2019 ‘special’ too!”The flight offer was picked up on New Year’s Eve by Gary Leff, a travel blogger, who wrote: “Oh my goodness this is an amazing fare.“You can fly from Vietnam – the cheapest fares originate in Da Nang, but other cities work as well – to Cathay Pacific’s US gateways starting at $675.”Leff warned his readers not to book any additional travel or hotels around the deal, as he suspected Cathay “might get seller’s remorse” and not honour the fares. “I’d wait a few days after buying additional travel or making additional non-refundable plans around the fare,” he said.But when Cathay became aware of the mistake, the airline said it would stand by the fares. “We do not want to go back on our promise to our customers,” it said. “We made a mistake but we look forward to welcoming you onboard with your ticket issued.”The airline did not respond to requests for comment about the number of flights sold at the steep discount. Cathay has removed all business and first-class flights for August – the month of the cut-price fares – from its website, but the same flights in September are listed for $16,000.Another blog, One Mile at a Time, saw it was possible to buy first-class flights from Hanoi to Vancouver for $988 return.In a blogpost, it said: “Wow! Hurry, this won’t last.” There were also first-class return flights from Hong Kong to New York offered for $1,450. The price of those flights in September is more than $31,000.The South China Morning Post tracked down 11 passengers who collectively bought 18 first and business-class tickets at the discounted prices. They paid a total of £21,700 for flights that should have cost £540,000.It is not the first time airlines have mistakenly offered premium-class flights at economy prices. Singapore Airlines made the error in 2014, as did Hong Kong Airlines last summer, and both honoured the errors. But in 2015, United Airlines cancelled hundreds of tickets it sold for $100 by mistake. United said it would not honour the fares because the error was caused by a “third-party software provider”.Earlier this year, Cathay had to repaint one of its jets after customers noticed the airline had spelled its name wrong.

It will have, Greggs says, 96 layers of light and crisp puff pastry – made with vegetable oil – and a “bespoke” Quorn filling.The launch comes after 20,000 people signed a petition by animal welfare organisation Peta last year calling on Greggs to produce a vegan version of its bestselling item. News of the new product emerged via a leaked email to Peta in December but the launch details were confirmed on Wednesday.The product arrives on Greggs’s shelves at the start of Veganuary – a growing movement that encourages people to embrace plant-based diets during January.“Like many food retailers we have seen increasing demand for vegetarian and vegan products,” said Roger Whiteside, the chief executive of Greggs. “We have been trying to develop a vegan version of our famous sausage roll for some time now.

The figures, released by HM Revenue and Customs on Wednesday following a freedom of information request, were rounded to the nearest 10 by HMRC.“The mainstream property market saw transaction levels tail off considerably following the EU referendum vote,” said Samuels, who submitted the FoI request. “But at the very top end of the market activity levels soared as ultra-wealthy opportunist buyers cashed in on rapidly softening prices.“The weakness of sterling means a fair percentage of these buyers were almost certainly based overseas, as some of Britain’s wealthiest cities became a goldmine for foreign investors seeking a bargain.“While many homeowners sit on their hands during times of political and economic volatility, the ultra-wealthy often use these periods to acquire assets at a significant discount.”Samuels said the highest levels of property spending had been in London. “Brexit had a particular impact on super-prime properties in the capital so for many very-high-net-worth iniduals the fallout from the EU referendum vote was an investment opportunity,” he said.However, Henry Pryor, an independent luxury property buying agent, said the ultra-prime market had become much more fragile recently as buyers waited for the final Brexit deal to be agreed, and said potential purchasers were demanding significant discounts.“Best in class still sells, but through 2018 the top end of the market would have made a thrilling David Attenborough film with predators waiting for the weakest to stumble before they pounced,” Pryor said.“Demand for the best homes remains and the ability of the richest to pay for the best homes still exists, but my experience is that wealthy people are usually rich because they are careful with their money not despite it – and they want to be confident that they are not overpaying.”Recent high-end sales include a Grade I-listed mansion on Belgrave Square that went for £60m. The five-storey stucco-fronted property, which was once the London home of William Cavendish, the seventh Duke of Devonshire, had been on the market for almost a decade and was first listed for £100m.Other properties that have sold recently for more than £10m include a seven-bedroom property at the top of Primrose Hill in north London, which had been home to the same family for 45 years and went for £17.4m. A six-bedroom townhouse overlooking a private cricket pitch in Chelsea sold for £13.7m.Outside the capital, a nine-bedroom mansion in a private estate near Ascot sold for £15m.

Construction is to begin in spring.“In Europe they don’t have a single village without a church, but here in Kosovo are at least 50 villages without a mosque,” remarks chief mufti Naim Tërnava in his offices near the city’s Imperial Mosque. On Islamic holidays, the throng of worshippers at this Ottoman-era mosque, built in 1461, often spills on to the street outside. Tërnava is taken aback by the heated debate over Pristina’s new mosque – for him, it is a practical necessity, “for the worship of God, and nothing else”.Kosovo is still struggling to carve out a place for itself in a restive part of Europe amid poor economic prospects. The young state needs all the friends it can get.Among its suitors is Turkey, which has made huge investments there and been a firm advocate for its international recognition and eventual accession to Nato and the EU. As the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, put it in a 2013 visit to the country: “Turkey is Kosovo, and Kosovo is Turkey.”Those words resonate in a Turkey whose assertive foreign policy has been characterised as “neo-Ottomanism”. Kosovo plays no small role in Turkey’s imperial history: the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 saw the defeat of the medieval Kingdom of Serbia and the beginning of the Ottoman conquest of south-eastern Europe. The empire went on to rule Kosovo for nearly 500 years, bringing with it Islam and many other cultural influences.A large mosque wouldn’t seem out of place in Pristina, so why the controversy? When the then mayor of Pristina, Isa Mustafa, laid the foundation stone, land had already been donated by the local municipality. Mustafa went on to become Kosovo’s prime minister, a position he held until last year, but the mosque was never built.The city’s Islamic community claims it took a long time to select the winning design and make sure it would “fit the location”. Pristina’s municipal government dragged its feet in approving the mosque, but this year finally granted permission, subject to a construction permit.Opposition to many new mosques across Europe is rooted in fear of Islam, but with 19 of every 20 people here Muslim, resistance to Pristina’s new mosque does not fit neatly into that trend. Some locals resent what they see as a symbol of Turkey’s overbearing influence, while others are suspicious of the creeping return of faith to a secular, post-socialist public space. Among the project’s most vocal opponents are local architects. Even though the public tender stressed the need for an original building, the design chosen is classical Ottoman. The project is being overseen by the Turkish state’s directorate for religious affairs, Diyanet, which has built dozens of other mosques across the Islamic world in recent years, in a move some describe as a key vehicle of Turkey’s power play.“Over 30 designs were submitted just months after the call for designs was made in 2012. Even Zaha Hadid proposed a design,” says the architect Arbër Sadiki. “But before the competition closed, interviews started appearing in the press in which the mufti described what the new mosque would look like.“Designs were supposed to be original, but the chosen one is just a copy of an Ottoman mosque. The decision looks more political than architectural to me. I know amazing architects doing work on contemporary mosques in Turkey. Why can’t we put Pristina on the map with something similar?”Under Josip Tito’s Yugoslavia, Pristina’s old bazaar and many historical buildings in its Ottoman-era downtown were destroyed as part of a modernisation campaign that secularised public space. As a result, explains Sadiki, modern Pristina is mostly a postwar city, and little constructed since the 1970s has been distinctive. Pristina’s most notable building today is its modernist, domed national library, built in 1982.Pristina isn’t the only city in Kosovo where ostentatious Turkish-funded mosque construction has taken place. In Mitrovica, about 20 miles north, clashes in the 2000s led to the city’s ision into southern (Albanian and Muslim) and northern (Serb and Orthodox Christian) halves. The smaller northern district flaunts its Serb identity, with a new Orthodox cathedral and a much-photographed mural proclaiming “Kosovo is Serbia, Crimea is Russia”. The larger southern part of town is festooned with Albanian flags and monuments to fighters from the Kosovo Liberation Army – as well as Kosovo’s largest mosque, which opened in 2014 and is named after the Istanbul district Bayrampaşa that funded its construction. Inside it is a riot of colour and ostentatiously Ottoman.There was no mosque like it in the city before – between 150 and 200 were destroyed in Kosovo during its vicious war of secession from Yugoslavia, many of them simple and modestly designed. For Mitrovica’s Muslims, the Bayrampaşa mosque is a symbol of redemption, if not reconciliation. Back in Pristina there is a sense Turkey has taken advantage of western disinterest to expand its influence in a place Ankara treats like part of its backyard.“People ask: why aren’t western investors coming here? Is it because we are Muslim? The sense is that the only door open to us leads to Turkey – and some want to walk through it.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db1a827b198d1b1ea54b6a71db8a68c8f2ae13ee/0_59_4905_2943/master/4905.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8119a08dd3af28f7adad4319b4bfa39","title":"chris grayling cabinet minister rail fare hikes transport","story":"The unjustifiable train fare hike is the latest reason why he should resign as transport secretary, but still he staggers onWhenever I see that Chris Grayling – officially secretary of state for transport, unofficially minister for blunders, incompetence and general disaster – still has a job, I wonder what Hugh Dalton would think. Dalton served as chancellor of the exchequer in Clement Attlee’s post-war Labour government for its first two years, and was the initial architect of its progressive economic measures. But then, in the late autumn of 1947, Dalton inadvertently leaked some minor details of his impending budget to a lobby journalist. By today’s standards, we’d struggle to call it much of a leak: the papers hit the stands very shortly before Dalton stood at the dispatch box. Yet this was such a scandal at the time that he felt obliged to resign from the cabinet.Seventy years on, it turns out that Chris Grayling does actually serve a useful purpose, as a measure of the extent to which the resignation threshold has been raised. Maybe the transport secretary should lend his name to this political trend: the Grayling principle, perhaps. Come now, you protest, which government has offered the British public such a varied smörgåsbord of ministerial resignations? Yet many of those are Tory Brexiteers fleeing a crime scene, not honourably resigning office due to their own failures or ministers resigning over allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct or, in the case of Priti Patel, stepping down because of secretive meetings with a foreign government.Even former home secretary Amber Rudd – who was swiftly reinstated to the cabinet – was forced to resign over misleading MPs, rather than the substance of the Windrush scandal, which deprived British citizens of healthcare, left them homeless, or even deported them. In this context, that Grayling continues to be paid £141,000 a year is a sign not only of shambolic government, but of national and political decline too.Given the chaos we have become used to, when you hear that Grayling has awarded a £13.8m contract to charter extra ferries in a no-deal Brexit scenario to a company that doesn’t actually have any ferries, you simply exclaim: “But of course!” He isn’t entirely to blame. The government as a whole is spending vast sums of public money on a no-deal outcome, principally as an act of psychological warfare aimed at coercing MPs into voting for Theresa May’s deal. Yet committing taxpayers’ money to a no-ships company to help save Britain from a hypothetical self-inflicted meltdown would surely be a scandal in normal times.Consider Grayling’s wider record. Train punctuality has sunk to a 13-year low, while rail fares have again been raised in an era in which British workers have suffered the worst stagnation in wages since the Napoleonic wars. During the disruption last year, in which up to 200 Govia Thameslink services a day were being cancelled, Grayling defended himself as not a “specialist in rail matters”. According to an interim report from the Office of Road and Rail, “nobody took charge”. As a bare minimum, he should have stripped Govia Thameslink of its franchise, but instead the company was merely required to spend more on passenger improvements.In 2016, a leaked letter found that Grayling opposed devolving control of suburban rail to London’s elected authorities for partisan reasons: he wanted to keep it “out of the clutches” of a Labour mayor. Even a former Conservative vice-chair declared no confidence in him after that. Both Crossrail and HS2 have been beset by disastrous delays and budget overruns, but while chairman Terry Morgan bit the bullet, Grayling remains in place.Grayling is therefore a source of inspiration to mediocre white men everywhere who, however much they lack ability, can still look forward to wielding power. We live in a country, after all, in which the first black female MP is pilloried for getting some figures wrong in an interview, while Grayling can preside over abject chaos in Britain’s essential national infrastructure and still remain in post. In that sense, he sums up a twofold national decline: in the standards of a morally decrepit political elite, and in the provision of essential services in a supposedly advanced economy.Of course, it’s not just about Grayling. The privatisation of the railway system is one of the most vivid examples of how market ideology has set itself on a collision course with reality. Even a thoroughly competent politician would struggle to run such a fragmented mess. That Grayling is no such thing merely compounds a terrible national error. And so, along with rain on a bank holiday, it seems there are some new certainties in decaying Tory Britain: that trains are delayed and overcrowded, that fares are unaffordable, and that Chris Grayling keeps his job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7247fe54022c5cb4de5b8508cac0b12ee051ead3/0_140_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=836f66ca5677e6f7a9d42814f6708b40","title":"dry january alcohol booze","story":"With weeks of misery and bad weather to come, we need comfort and soothing, not military training in the parkA few millennia ago, pagans in northern latitudes realised that a right old knees-up featuring roasted roadkill and proto-Jägerbombs was needed to cheer up the populace during the bleak midwinter. Christians later horned in on this annual shindig, claiming counterintuitively that our Redeemer was born at this special time. Finally, capitalists carved out a piece of the action. And so it came to pass: the season of gorging, gouging and guilting was born. God bless us, every one.In such depressing circumstances, what we need is comfort and soothing. Instead, though, we’re exhorted to jump off a dietary cliff, to go cold turkey after weeks of eating cold turkey, to submit to ye venerable ritual of self-administered punishment to atone for ye presumed seasonal sins. We’re enjoined to do ostensibly improving things: give up alcohol strip down to our pants and get shouted at by British Military Fitness in the park put the Hobnobs back on the supermarket shelves enrol for grade 3 bassoon join a book club reading Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason.I’m no doctor – but surely, just as it’s madness to stop taking antidepressants suddenly rather than weaning oneself off them, so it is folly to give up booze and biscuits in January if you were enjoying them only hours earlier.One in 10 Britons who drink alcohol, though, are expected to give it up this month, many of them having downloaded Alcohol Change UK’s Dry January app that lets you track the units, calories and money saved by not drinking. The charity’s website includes inspiring stories, such as the woman who went on a journey from boozing to dry January to running the New York marathon.If these initiatives help us save money (apparently the average Briton spends £50,000 on alcohol during a lifetime), lose weight, sleep better, reduce the strain on the NHS, improve our complexions and raise money for cancer research, that’s all good. But hold on: wouldn’t a dry December app be a better idea than a January one? It’s during that month, after all, that the average Briton drinks 67 units of alcohol a week. It’s then that we need to resist the social pressure to drink – possibly by means of an app I’m thinking of developing that will administer electric shocks of increasing intensity as your blood-alcohol ratio gets higher.Lauren Booker, author of Try Dry: The Official Guide to a Month off Booze, recommends you clear out your alcohol for January. “You don’t need to pour it down the drain,” she counsels. “Either lock it away in the shed so you’re not tempted, or ask a friend if you can leave it at their house until the end of the month.” And then what? On 1 February, after the seasonal ceasefire, you can resume the war on your liver.That’s the risk – that for all those inspired by dry January to give up binge drinking and become marathon runners, many more will undergo a short-term purge that will have negligible long-term benefits. What’s needed is not the crazy switchback from drunk December to dry January, the booze equivalent of yo-yo dieting. We need to learn not the virtue of short-term abstinence, nor to desperately hope that a month off the pop will catalyse a lifestyle revolution, but something much harder – the way of moderation.But the prevailing rhetoric goes another way. “Can you go dry this January?” asks Cancer Research. “Take on the ultimate test of willpower by going booze-free for a whole 31 days and raise vital funds to help beat cancer.” Like the bushtucker trial, it’s a gauntlet I refuse to pick up. I’ll give money to charity, but not narrow my lifestyle options.Almost a century ago, TS Eliot said, “April is the cruellest month.” Maybe it was back then, but nowadays it’s January. So it’s time to fight back, and to make this month not the time for sadomasochistic rituals like Cancer Research’s Dryathlon, but for Jaffa Cakes dunked in dessert wine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dd684fce0c78cd150c6cbfd26652e3ec9d4154b/0_197_5927_3558/master/5927.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acfac18c3e6f5630005070f14fce713b","title":"turning water into wine how did simple h2o become a luxury commodity","story":"From crystal infusions to water sommeliers and even bottling the frequency of rainbows, the top end of town has well and truly cashed in on the world’s most vital resourceOver the last few years, an unusual and conspicuous sight has become commonplace in the cafes and eateries of Sydney’s inner suburbs: Frequency H20 Alkaline Spring Water. The water, which costs AUD$3.30 per 1 litre bottle, proclaims to be infused with the sound, light and literal frequencies of three very abstract “flavours”: Love (528Hz), Lunar (210.42Hz) and Rainbow (430-770THz).Last year, Love became the first Australian water in nearly three decades to place first in the best bottled water category of the prestigious Berkeley Springs International Water Tasting. Its creator, Sturt Hinton (not a typo he’s ironically named after the desert), meets me in his local vegan fish and chip shop. It’s one of 400 stores he personally delivers his product to whenever stocks run low.“It’s about lifting the spirits of the world, you know what I mean? And lifting my spirits,” he says. He was inspired to create Frequency H20 after a lengthy bout of crippling depression. “Just bringing delight to people, and it delivers this promise to consumers through having something so high quality and people can taste it. They can feel the difference. It’s clean, it’s light, they just love it. They love the idea. What a wonderful concept. Beautiful water.”The story of Frequency H20 was enough to pique the interest of Katy Perry (whose management requested it during her recent Witness tour), Paris Hilton (now following @frequencyh2o) and the Veronicas, who share their appreciation online with such vigour they could be unofficial brand ambassadors. Following this year’s Berkeley Springs victory, the Australian government at large even took note, with Austrade selecting it for the official Commonwealth Games showcase. Though he claims to have invested $100,000 in its development, Hinton is unwilling to discuss the unique device he claims he designed (“It’s not like Coke is going to give up their trade secret.”) that produces his water by harnessing “the incredible natural alchemy of energised molecules”. He does acknowledge this nebulous air of naturopathy is central to its appeal. That and the trending but increasingly dubious belief that alkaline water is better for you than regular tap water.In the luxury water business, a free good is repackaged and resold as aspirational. “I think it’s like the most marketable thing ever invented,” Hinton says.The core of this concept of “fine water” might seem like a new phenomenon, but in fact it dates back to the Roman empire, where certain aqueducts were preferred, or even considered ine, and natural carbonated water was imported from Germania in earthen jars. The industrial revolution would literally poison the well, as drinking water became a vector for diseases like typhus and cholera. The rich could afford to have unspoiled water delivered from remote sources poor people simply died until municipal chlorination in the early 20th century helped people live longer.Bottled or otherwise, there are now more people on earth consuming more water than ever before, and climate change just might be contributing to an increasing dearth of it with longer and more intense droughts.The story of water, then, is the story of the world – and the luxury industry is cashing in.Hinton’s frequency-infused industry darlings are just the tip of the iceberg. Some premium waters such as Svalbarði, sold locally for A$115 per 750ml bottle, are literally made from icebergs harvested on expeditions to the Arctic Ocean. Water bottles with crystals in them and crystal-infused water like that of Australia’s Madam Dry (A$49.99 per 12 pack) are trends within a trend, inspired by Instagram’s wilderness of “wellness”, the regimens of Miranda Kerr and there’s that naturopathy again: Madam Dry lists what astrological sign the moon was traveling through when “brewing” commenced. Premium, luxury or fine water has even co-opted much of the wine industry’s terminology – “varietal”, “mouthfeel” “terroir” – as well as introducing some of its own. “Total dissolved solids”, for instance, is a measurement scale unique to understanding why and how a water tastes and even feels the way it does. Water from the Fiji Islands, with its TDS of 222, is said to be smooth and velvety. Water like Vichy Catalan from Spain, with its TDS of 3054, is said to be extremely salty and complex.The phenomenon isn’t particularly new. In 2005, “water sommelier” Martin Riese caught the attention of the media when he created a water menu at Berlin’s First Floor restaurant after a guest complained about the taste of the water on offer. By 2008 he’d published Die Welt des Wassers (The World of Water) in 2010 he was certified by the German water trade association and in 2013 he landed in Los Angeles, after receiving an O-1 visa for his “extraordinary knowledge of water”.As the country’s first certified water sommelier, he launched a 45-page water menu at Ray’s \u0026amp Stark Bar. Two days later, he was a national curiosity, covered on Good Morning America, Fox News and CNN, and even interviewed by television science presenter Bill Nye. He opened a $100,000 bottle of water for a tasting with Diplo and 2Chainz. He appeared on late night host Conan O’Brien’s show in September 2013.“Pretty much every day, I have people rolling their eyes when they hear the words ‘water sommelier,’ and when I even tell them that I can match water to food, more eye-rolling starts,” Reiss says. But, he stresses, he is driven by a loftier goal. “I want to give value to water. When people understand that water is not just water, they might rethink their use of water.“Here in America, people do not even know anymore where the water is coming from. They think that a purified water is the same as spring water. Purified water finds mostly its origin in the municipal water system, so it’s actually tap water, which is already processed then filtered and with very small amounts of minerals added. The end product is a highly processed beverage from a factory. On the other hand, you have waters which are coming from a natural occurring source, like a spring, glacial, aquifer and so on. These waters are barely treated and you can actually taste the water’s origin. In wine terms, you would call it terroir.”There had been five schools around the world where it was possible to become a certified water sommelier: two in Germany (one being the prestigious and original Doemens), one in Italy, one in China and one in South Korea. On 1 August last year, Riese established a sixth in the United States with his business partner and Fine Water Society founder, Michael Mascha. They recently certified their first water sommelier in Myanmar after three months of online courses, a verbal examination and a final project.Mascha says most people in the industry would consider him an early catalyst for what the market now considers fine water. His own origin story has a familiar flavour: like Hinton, water saved him. In 2002, he says, his doctor told him “you can live or continue drinking alcohol”. He founded the Fine Water Society that same year, a sprawling, invite-only index of fine water from around the world that serves to define, explain and promote the ever-swelling industry.“The water we are drinking is actually older than our planet,” Mascha says – and that in-built cosmic intrigue lends itself to all kinds of stories.“We see a lot of claims around water. Microstructured, wetter, smaller molecules, alkalinity, frequency … those are all marketing messages created as there is no other story to tell,” he says. “There is no source or history to the water. It comes from a factory and the stories are made up to confuse.“Michael Pollan, a USA-based food writer, famously believes: ‘When it says “healthy” on the package, it is probably not.’ Great water,” Mascha continues, “comes from unspoiled sources and they are usually remote.”Jamal Qureshi’s Svalbarði water, for instance, is made of ice gathered from the glaciers in Kongsfjorden, part of the titular Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. That A$115 bottle might seem exorbitant to the layperson but it is far from the most expensive fine water on the market. That honour goes to Acqua di Cristallo Tributo a Modigliani, a bottle of which sold for the jawdropping sum of £39,357 for 750ml in 2010, making it the most expensive bottle of water in the world according to Guinness, thanks in no small part to the bottle itself being 24-carat gold. Svalbarði, meanwhile, has drawn an incredible amount of attention to itself with a fable of production the envy of any winemaker.Qureshi stumbled over the Svalbard region when he was young and travelling obtaining water from it is “an extreme logistical and cost challenge” which he saw as marketing potential for a “brand that stands out to consumers”.“Having a bottle that could match the story and be worth a purchase almost in and of itself was also critical. People have a ‘wow’ moment when they see it. Then when they see pictures of the ice gathering it is always a second ‘wow’ moment.”Qureshi, who holds regular water tastings, explains that as with anything we put in our mouths, smell, taste and feel are vital. “Proper water should generally not have smell, which tends to be a sign of taint that is not good. Odourless is best. Mouthfeel is the other major component. From super light, airy, and smooth like Svalbarði, to creamy textures, to very mineral-heavy waters that start to almost have a tangible, ‘solid’ feel in the mouth. Carbonation obviously has a huge impact on mouthfeel as well, from very gentle bubbles to big and bold ones.”Qureshi sees a social responsibility in his work too.“We aren’t gathering sea ice,” he says of Svalbarði. “The icebergs are carved off of freshwater glaciers. Obviously we are gathering them from the sea and as such we are constantly reminded of the problems of rising sea levels and plastic pollution in particular.” Because of the latter, they use glass bottles because of the former, they are carbon neutral, and are “now going carbon negative, so that each bottle will help actually preserve a piece of the Arctic ice cap.”Qureshi recently moved his family from the States to Svalbard, close to where the whales now sing more deeply to hear each other over the noise of melting icebergs. “Living in Svalbard these issues have become very personal. I walk on the beach here in the middle-of-nowhere Arctic and pass by discarded plastic fishing nets that have washed in from the middle of the Atlantic. We live daily with freakishly warm temperatures, for this part of the world anyway, and I watch how the glacier fronts are retreating. I talk to old-timers and see their pictures of how the fjords used to freeze and no one could get a ship in here for five months in the winter. Now the local fjord hasn’t frozen in a decade and it rained this past January when it should have been -20C.”Water sommelier Reise also sees himself as an advocate for a vital resource. “By promoting fine water, I hope I can do my part to protect areas around the world and open people’s mind that water is so much more than just a commodity.” He cites his involvement with Viva Con Agua, a charity in Hamburg that seeks to improve drinking water in developing nations. “I fight for people who don’t have access to clean and safe drinking water. I hope I can spark conversations with my water menu about the topic of water in general. The more we know about water the more we will protect it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db21e32b21d991b77c9523cb16b3af884e2f9876/0_324_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0816bf11de5b13fe47cec689e9f3b80","title":"national parks shutdown impact joshua tree yosemite yellowstone","story":"Human feces, overflowing garbage and damaging behavior reported as staff hampered over busy holiday period Human feces, overflowing garbage, illegal off-roading, fights over camping spots and other damaging behavior in fragile areas are beginning to overwhelm some of the American west’s most popular national parks, as a partial government shutdown left the areas open to visitors but with few staff on duty.Camping will be suspended in Joshua Tree national park, California, from Wednesday because of the chaos.“It’s a free-for-all,” Dakota Snider, 24, who lives and works in Yosemite Valley, in northern California, said , as Yosemite national park officials announced closings of some minimally supervised campgrounds and public areas within the park that are overwhelmed.“It’s so heartbreaking. There is more trash and human waste and disregard for the rules than I’ve seen in my four years living here,” Snider said.The 11th day of the partial government shutdown, amid rows over federal funding and immigration issues, has forced furloughs of hundreds of thousands of federal government employees. This has left many parks without most of the rangers and others who staff campgrounds, enforce rules and otherwise keep parks running.Unlike shutdowns in some previous administrations, the Trump administration was leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs, said John Garder, the senior budget director of the not-for-profit National Parks Conservation Association.“We’re afraid that we’re going to start seeing significant damage to the natural resources in parks and potentially to historic and other cultural artifacts,” Garder said. “We’re concerned there’ll be impacts to visitors’ safety.”Spokespeople with the interior department did not respond to requests for comment.Jeremy Barnum, a National Park Service spokesman, had said as the shutdown took hold that “national parks will remain as accessible as possible while still following all applicable laws and procedures.” In practice, that has meant many park toilets were closed or filled to overflowing and acutely unable to deal with the larger crowds entering over the holiday period and taking advantage of the fact that many fees are not being charged during the shutdown. Campers at Joshua Tree national park in southern California’s deserts were reporting squabbles as different visitors laid claims to sites, with no rangers on hand to adjudicate, said Ethan Feltges, who operates the Coyote Corner gift shop outside Joshua Tree. Now all camping facilities in the park will be shut from noon on Wednesday, the authorities announced.Feltges and other business owners around Joshua Tree had stepped into the gap as much as possible, hauling trailers into the park to empty overflowing trash bins and sweeping and stocking restrooms that were still open, Feltges said.“The whole community has come together,” Feltges said. “Everyone loves the park. And there’s a lot of businesses that actually need the park.”Most visitors were being respectful of the desert wilderness and park facilities, Joshua Tree’s superintendent, David Smith, said in a statement.But some are seizing on the shortage of park staffers to drive off road illegally and otherwise damage the park, as well as relieving themselves in the open, a park statement said. Joshua Tree said it would begin closing some campgrounds for all but day use. Meanwhile, some visitors have strung Christmas lights in the protected Joshua trees, many of which are hundreds of years old, the Los Angeles Times reported.At Yosemite, Snider, the local resident, said crowds of visitors were driving into the park to take advantage of free admission, with only a few park rangers working and a limited number of restrooms open.Visitors were allowing their dogs to run off-leash in an area rich with bears and other wildlife, and scattering bags of garbage along the roads, Snider said.“You’re looking at Yosemite Falls and in front of you is plastic bottles and trash bags,” he said.In Yellowstone national park, private companies have picked up some of the maintenance normally done by federal workers. The contractors that operate park tours by snowmobile, buses and vans are grooming trails, hauling trash and replacing toilet paper at pit toilets and restrooms along their routes. The park is known for its geysers and delicate hot springs that are already notoriously vulnerable to human interference, as are Yellowstone’s bison, bears and other protected animals that have increasingly been threatened by humans getting too close.Nearly all roads inside Yellowstone are normally closed for winter, meaning most visitors at this time of the year access park attractions like the gigantic Old Faithful geyser or the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone valley using guides. Those guides are splitting the cost of grooming the trails used by their vehicles to keep their operations going, said Travis Watt, the general manager of See Yellowstone Alpen Guides based in West Yellowstone, Montana.Arches national park in Utah is closed because the federal shutdown means there no funds for snowplows and the roads are impassible, while Zion park further south has scaled back operations.There are reports of roads blocked by uncleared ice and trash causing three-hour tailbacks in Sequoia national park in California."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf6faa86ac791450bc87bb83e0d8aecad9abef16/649_1245_5143_3086/master/5143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00cd703fb138d496639f74e53a064a54","title":"the stigmatised art of tattooing in japan in pictures","story":"The country’s ban on tattoos was lifted in 1948, but suspicion and their association with yakuza mobsters continues.

The film is Mary Queen of Scots, which stars Saoirse Ronan in the title role directing it has wrought many changes for the 42-year-old, Salford-born Rourke – not least exchanging the familiar embrace of a 250-seat theatre for a drenched Scottish hillside. “I’d be trying to direct more actors than you can even fit into the Donmar while it rained horizontally into my ear. I remember feeling that there had to be a German compound noun for that feeling when fewer Highland cattle than you had booked actually turn up.”The film follows the relationship between the Scottish queen and Elizabeth I, played by Margot Robbie. This is well-worked dramatic territory, and Rourke’s film is full of the exquisite costumes, dramatic battle scenes and eye-catching locations one associates with historical films, including occasional bursts of over-the-top period campery for good measure, such as David Tennant’s lavishly bearded John Knox who rails furiously against the unnatural spectacle of a woman on the throne. That “whore of Babylon”, he thunders, that “false Queen”.In other ways, though, the film is startlingly unconventional. For a start, Rourke has imported from British theatre a principle still unfamiliar in cinema: colour-blind casting. Bess of Hardwick, for example, is played by Gemma Chan, while Thomas Randolph, Elizabeth’s agent at Mary’s court, is portrayed by Adrian Lester. This has not gone down well in certain quarters. “I sometimes feel,” says Rourke, “that people’s reaction to a person of colour in a film is more an index of their prejudices than about having a real issue with authenticity.”And anyway, she says, turning a story into a film is already an exercise in make-believe. “Representation is an act of the imagination. Margot Robbie is Australian. Saoirse Ronan is Irish. Jack Lowden is Scottish and is playing an English person, which was probably the weirdest thing for people on set.”Lester, she adds, was an obvious first choice to play a shrewd diplomatic go-between. “Adrian was Peter Brook’s Hamlet. He knows more about this period in history, because of his depth of experience as a classical actor, than anyone else did on that set, except for perhaps Simon Russell Beale, who turned up one day to read Mary’s death warrant. Because of his exquisite finesse and subtlety as an actor, he is better equipped to play an ambassador than anyone else I can think of. Why would you not harness that talent and knowledge?”The other departure from convention reflects Rourke’s feminist eye. Her film is based on My Heart Is My Own, a biography of Mary by Cambridge history don John Guy that attempts to rescue the Scottish Catholic queen from some of the more lurid claims made about her, some promoted by the English Protestant court.“What’s happened to Mary is that she’s got a bit stuck in Tate Britain,” says Rourke. “She’s a bit like one of those pre-Raphaelite paintings, of which I’m not a great fan, where she is kind of a prone victim who has either just been killed or is ready for sex. She has become either a femme fatale governed by sexual appetites, or someone who is too wilful to be competent. Elizabeth is usually set up as a counterpoint, portrayed as iron-willed, calculating. I don’t think any of those things are quite true.”Rourke attempts to present a more subtle story, not just about “strong women”, but about two people who were also “gigantically vulnerable, sometimes confused about what to do, trying to work out what the political landscape was, fighting for the rights of their own bodies – stuff that we do now that is sometimes missing from those narratives.”The film has much to say about bodies: about the queens’ different calculations about marriage and producing an heir about the violence done to women by men about sexual pleasure about physical closeness between women friends about clothing as a projection of power and desirability. When I last saw Rourke, several months previously, she had been arguing with producers over the edit. She wanted to include scenes that showed Mary having her period, and another that showed her being given oral sex.“I was fighting for a period in a period movie,” she says. “Those were instructive discussions about how honest we were being about women’s bodies and what they do, women’s pleasure and what that is, and a queen’s body as a political canvas. I felt that was something I hadn’t seen before, that I just really wanted to show. There are not many of us who know what it feels like to be a crowned head of Europe – but what we do know is what it’s like to fight for the rights of our bodies.”She got her way in the end: the scenes are still there. “We need to show this stuff. It does need normalising. A journalist asked me how hard it was to shoot the scene where Mary has her period, and my answer was, ‘Not hard at all!’ There were six women in that room, and it was probably the thing that just most easily staged itself. But it does continue to freak some people out.”As for the cunnilingus scene, Rourke did not employ an intimacy director – a safeguarding role increasingly being discussed in the performing arts. Rather, she worked with the choreographer Wayne McGregor, who was movement director for the film. “I don’t think I’ve ever done a sex scene without a movement director, without treating it as a piece of choreography,” she says. “I hope the sex scenes feel truthful and alive. To think in a language of movement helps remove embarrassment, discomfort or shame.”Rourke is still in a tiny minority as a woman director in the mainstream film industry. But she is optimistic that this will change – and quickly. She was in her mid-30s when she became artistic director of the Donmar in 2012. “My experience in theatre is that the door opened a crack and let a few of us in – and people just kept flowing through. It’s important that this film succeeds, not because I am desperate for it to succeed, but so they will let a few more women through. That is the pressure I feel.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/457d365d619aee23157f54e665b14683435480b4/0_402_1057_634/master/1057.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=207a055a2f618d83160bc8e7732a6b33","title":"deep fried prawn heads greasy gimmick perfect bar snack","story":"One Japanese restaurant goes through hundreds of prawns a day – now it is serving the heads with beerThe heads arrive on a plate, John the Baptist-style, hot and crispy with a hint of grease. There are 10 of them, each covered in corn starch and deep fried, and stacked up in a sort of pyre. On the side, salt and sesame seeds for dipping and, if you are drinking, a beer. From a distance, they could be spiders in rigor mortis. Or facehuggers from Alien.The chef who brought the plate picks up a head. “I mean, they’re disgusting, really, that’s what they are,” he says, and with that he walks the thing across the plate to show me how “bottom feeders” eat.If you can ignore the optics, they taste a lot better than they look. Less a delicacy and more a byproduct at Koya City, in London – the brilliant Japanese fast food restaurant known for its udon noodles – the heads are offcuts, the bit you would normally chuck.But since Koya goes through hundreds of prawns every day, it made sense to save them, remove the juices – the sweet, flavoursome brainy bit that the Spanish sometimes suck out – deep fry them at 180C (356F) and turn them into an elevated bar snack. They used to be served off menu, but they could only remain there for so long. They are now served in the evenings only, with beer, and sell out pretty quickly. At £6.90, they work out at 70p per head.Nose to tail – or head to tail, whatever you call it – is a happy side-effect of a blustering economy and a vogue for turning the edible into the agreeable, for showing respect to the animals we eat by not wasting any of their parts. And while these taste great, it is really about the texture, about snapping the legs like twigs, about almost cutting your mouth because they are sharp. It is macho eating, but delicately done.Frying has a knack for rendering dull things great and, in this case, it is the corn starch that creates the crunch, says the head chef, Shuko Oda. Even as they cool down, they retain a bite, which means they are ideal as a snack with your Kirin beer at your local izakaya.The menu at Koya barrels through various parts of the prawn’s anatomy, but to keep things in the family, I order some prawn tempura.The prawns you find in tempura are misleadingly large. In fact, each of them is 20cm (8in) long, but dismembered, with the tendons cut and the cord severed, otherwise they’ll curl up when they cook. Oda thinks there is a high chance I am eating the body of one of the heads.I have tried some unusual bodies in my time: chicken feet, a scorpion flash fried and served in soy sauce, ants cooked three ways. Prawn heads are still a bit of a gimmick, but when they are cooked like this, you wonder why they are not the norm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26c975e61ffee9d2ce951618a65ebf4dd8b568a1/0_0_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c0a89524e7b66aae677848ec1be1091","title":"leeks tomatoes cheese sauce recipe nick deverell smith","story":"A vegetarian comfort food that makes the most of in-season British leeksThis is a really simple and comforting dish to make when you have had a busy day at work and only have a few things in the fridge.

It was mid-November and the USA squad were settling into their hotel before the friendly against England at Wembley when the conversation turned to whether he would one day return to the country where he first fell in love with football as a child.“England, the Premier League, is a league where lots of kids dream of playing so there is no reason why maybe one day I won’t play here,” he said rather cryptically. Yet the double negative was fooling no one. By that stage, the £58m deal between Dortmund and Chelsea that will see the 20-year-old attacker loaned back to the Westfalenstadion for the rest of the season before he completes his move to the west London club in the summer was virtually agreed, with Pulisic signing a five-and-a-half year deal at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.In truth, however, this has been a transfer in the making ever since he and his agent, Rob Moore, opted to turn down Dortmund’s offer of a new contract at the end of last season. Previously the poster boy for the club’s ambitious new approach based on promoting players from its youth academy, Pulisic moved to Germany in 2015 after being scouted at a youth tournament the previous year and had made more than 70 appearances in the Bundesliga before he turned 20 in September.But the emergence of the young England forward Jadon Sancho at the tail-end of last season and the signing of the Danish winger Jacob Bruun Larsen have seen him start only five of Dortmund’s 17 league matches this campaign. Indeed they have established a surprise six-point lead over Bayern Munich at the halfway stage, meaning the prospect of losing yet another prized asset to one of Europe’s wealthiest clubs was perhaps not the disaster it may once have been, despite his undoubted ability.Dortmund have now recouped more than £220m since August 2017 from the sales of Pulisic, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Ousmane Dembélé and sporting director, Michael Zorc, certainly seemed philosophical about losing such a talented and marketable player. “It was always Christian’s dream to play in the Premier League,” he said. “That certainly has to do with his American background, and as a result we were unable to extend his contract.”Manchester United and Liverpool both expressed interest in signing him last summer, although it was Chelsea who pushed hardest given their attempt to provide more competition for the ageing Willian and Pedro who are both – like Eden Hazard – out of contract in the summer of 2020. An attempt to make Pulisic Maurizio Sarri’s first signing in July fell short when Dortmund demanded in excess of £70m but with his value decreasing due to his contract situation, they got their man.Chelsea insist that paying the third-highest transfer fee in their history after Kepa Arrizabalaga and Álvaro Morata will not have any bearing on the future of Hazard despite his diminishing contract status, although Pulisic has shown he is capable of operating in a number of forward positions, including as a No10. His arrival also inevitably casts doubt over the future of Callum Hudson-Odoi despite Sarri’s insistence that the teenage forward has the ability to become of the best young players in Europe, with Bayern Munich reportedly having already had a £20m bid for him rejected. It will be intriguing to see whether he is tempted to follow the example of Sancho and England youth teammate Reiss Nelson – currently on loan at Hoffenheim from Arsenal – by heading to the Bundesliga to further his development.Pulisic will make the reverse journey having spent a year living in Oxfordshire village of Tackley and playing for Brackley Town’s youth team before returning to the US with his family at the age of eight. “I was nervous about coming to England at first, with ‘soccer’ and everything, but when I left at first I missed it a lot. I missed that culture,” he recalled in November. “Everyone liked to play soccer, everyone was there. And then I would come back to the US and no one really wanted to play soccer, so it was different.” Now he will get the chance to show he has been worth the wait."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77cfd79d31a21443451165cb44dc1c2abd75902c/0_53_1840_1104/master/1840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39ee65e3122ddf84f976c5114e94f2d7","title":"liverpool manchester city jurgen klopp best team in world","story":"Jürgen Klopp has said Manchester City remain the best team in the world despite the recent slump that has left them trailing Liverpool by seven points before Thursday’s game at the Etihad Stadium.Pep Guardiola, the City manager, bestowed that mantle on Liverpool following a run of nine consecutive Premier League victories. His Anfield counterpart accepts that may be true on form but insists Liverpool’s unbeaten league campaign faces the biggest test imaginable against the champions.“It is one of the most difficult games you can play in the modern football world, away at City,” Klopp said. “We felt that plenty of times. It’s a really strong team with an outstanding manager. We have to be prepared as good as possible, we have to be brave, full of desire, angry – all that stuff, like in all the other games.As for Guardiola’s praise for Liverpool, Klopp said: “I heard it. He said: ‘In the moment’. Yes, with the record we had in December – I’m not sure if another team had a record like this in December – we are in a good moment. And we are a very good team as well so that’s why we have the amount of points but we prepare for one game. Would I say they are the best team in the world if nobody would ask me? No. But we talk about it. It sounds like we go there and we are more likely to win the game then they are. It’s just not true.”City have lost three of their last five league matches, prompting Guardiola to claim their title defence would have been over had they not defeated Southampton on Sunday. Klopp admits Thursday’s showdown provides an opportunity to turn the season either way.“You have to ask Pep why he said it. If we would be 10 points behind then would my first thing after the game be to say: ‘We still will catch them!’ Of course not. It’s difficult with the qualities all the teams have but it’s just not important what happens. It’s the third of January, it’s a very important game for both teams and I would use it as motivation for the other team.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4670cdfcbcfc515cbf944cc4995ace79b26ace3/0_180_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28528ae72cde6209ef2043ad6ea3f0b0","title":"chelsea v southampton huddersfield v burnley premier league live","story":"42 min: This game has turned on its head! What a nightmare couple of minutes for Huddersfield. McNeil, who has once again been very impressive for Burnley, drives at Schindler, who was already on a yellow card. The German is booked again – he argues but it’s a yellow all day long. It’s a free kick to Burnley on the edge of the box, Gudmundsson curls an effort over the wall but Lossl saves well.Burnley get back on terms! Dwight McNeil gets some space on the left, and finds Chris Wood, who makes no mistake from six yards. That’s his 100th goal in English football.Watford double their lead, and it’s two for Deeney too! Deulofeu runs at Aké, his cross is blocked, but Deeney is there to pounce on the rebound and lash the ball into the net.37 min: Penalty shout for West Ham. Arnautovic goes down in heap after a clumsy tackle from Dunk. It’s probably a penalty but Chris Kavanagh waves play on! 35 min: Hazard denied by Gunn! Chelsea have been poor but they spring into life down the left. Hazard slips his man and fires a fierce shot towards the roof of the net, but the ball his Gunn in the shoulder and bounces clear. He didn’t know much about it, but that was an excellent save from the 22 year old.Mounié’s first goal since April! This is a simple goal, but a good one, all owing to the cross from Mbenza, who curls a beautiful, inswinging, arching delivery from the left wing. It catches Mee and Tarkowski flat-footed in the middle and all Mounié has to do it glance it into the corner from six yards out. Massive goal at the bottom. 30 min: Amazing double save from Huddersfield’s Lossl! First he gets down well to palm away a back-post header, then immediately gets up and spreads himself in front of Westwood, who sees his shot blocked from an acute angle!The away side take the lead with their first attack. Femenia plays an incisive ball into the right channel, Doucouré crosses and Deeney heads it back across goal. A classic header from the club captain. 10 min: First chance in the late kick-off between Bournemouth and Watford, which falls to the home side. A cross is headed out and Lerma slashes at it wildly. Should have done a lot better.22 min: I’ve been impressed with Raúl Jiménez this season. He’s led the line well and also provided a genuine goal threat. Seems to be struggling tonight though against Palace. It’s 0-0 there. 20 min: Whisper it, but Southampton are looking quite comfortable at Stamford Bridge.17 min: Big chance for Huddersfield! Billing wings a long throw into the box: Mounié wins the flick on with the ball falling to Kongolo who swivels and misses. The ball breaks to Schindler six yards out and the German toe-pokes it at goal, but his shot is blocked by his team-mate Pritchard. Corner to Huddersfield, which is well cleared by Burnley.15 min: It’s kicked off in the late kick off between Bournemouth and Watford, and also with Newcastle v Manchester United, which you can follow with Jacob Steinberg.13 min: Azpilicueta floats a wonderfully-weighted ball over the top of Southampton’s defence and Morata has a golden chance to score, but only glances the ball into Gunn’s arms. It was a tricky header no doubt – a slightly easier version of that RVP goal for Holland in the World Cup – but still a tame effort from the Spaniard. Morata hasn’t scored enough for Chelsea this season, but Azpilicueta has a funny knack of picking out his compatriot with crosses. I remember at least three Chelsea goals from that combination. The two obviously have a good connection on the pitch.11 min: Carroll is doing his best to hold the ball up, but he’s a little bit off the pace, and fouls Stephens well inside West Ham’s half. 9 min: Chelsea have their first big chance of the game with a free kick on the edge of Southampton’s box. It’s on the right side, so suiting the left footer, and Alonso sees his effort deflected over. 5 min: Huddersfield are having all of the ball against Burnley, who seem to have reverted to their normal selves: compact without the ball, direct with it.2 min: Brighton have started well at West Ham. Two corners in quick succession lead to two chances: the first sees in-form Locadia volley a shot at goal, which is blocked by Obiang. The second sees the ball drop to Duffy at the back post, but the defender can only loop a header into Fabianski’s arms. Peeeeeeeeep! And we’re underway in four games: Bournemouth v Watford will kick off at 8pm.Yep, although he doesn’t have as much dynamism. He can’t play wide, he can’t play in a two in midfield. He basically has to play in the No 10 role, which is not the same as Lanzini, or even Snodgrass. West Ham’s No 9, Andy Carroll, is making his first start in exactly a year, when he started against West Brom. He did this in injury time. He’s got eight goals in his last eight games in January. Doesn’t even wear gloves. If there is ever a campaign to bring back stanchions, this video is surely it. Palace battered Wolves 4-1 in 1995, scoring four worldies in the process. Just a rumour but it looks like Dominic Solanke’s move to Palace is off. For all the confirmed transfers, have a go on our interactive. In other news, this is a friend of a friend. If anyone can help with further sightings CCTV then please let the police know on 101 quoting incident 262 on 23rd December.Samir Nasri is on the bench for West Ham, following the end of his doping suspension and his short-term move to east London. Will be very interesting to see how he gets on this season – it’s a very West Ham signing the guy is obviously a baller, but not sure he’ll have the legs to suit Manuel Pellegrini’s team. With Mark Noble and Robert Snodgrass in the squad, I’m not sure how much room there is for another ball-playing midfielder that sort of floats around the edge of the penalty box. Bournemouth v Watford will now kick off at 8pm. The fire service has been called to deal with an incident at Dean Court.Team news for Bournemouth: Gosling and Lerma come into central midfield, with Surman dropping to the bench. Looks like Eddie Howe’s side are playing a 4-4-2 tonight.Watford make a massive five changes from the side that drew against Newcastle: Femenía, Holebas, Doucouré, Sema, and Deeney come in for Janmaat, Masina, Quina, Hughes, SuccessTough match this for Southampton, who are not expected to win at Chelsea but have a much easier run of games in January and February. Their next five games in the league see them face Leicester, Everton, Palace, Burnley and Cardiff. Saints are currently out of the relegation zone on goal difference. I’d say Ralph Hasenhüttl would be disappointed if there isn’t daylight between them and the bottom three by the end of that run.Hasenhüttl does make a couple of interesting changes: England U-21 goalkeeper Angus Gunn, son of former Norwich keeper Bryan, makes his first Premier League start and 19-year-old Callum Slattery is on the Southampton bench for the first time. Matt Targett has a knock so it looks like Cedric Soares will play on the left side of defence.Festive football is nearly over, but not yet. One more round of games before the third round of the FA Cup marks the end of it. For some of these players this is the fourth game in 12 games. Limbs will be tired, defences stretched. Hopefully we’ll have some goals to speak of. We’ll have live updates on these five games. If you want Newcastle v Manchester United, we’re liveblogging that separately. We’ll have the team news as soon as it drops. Kick-offs all at 7.45pm GMT.

Atsu crosses from the right and Rondon heads over from six yards. He couldn’t quite rise high enough.32 min: Lascelles, who’s on a booking, es into another full-blooded challenge to stop a surging Pogba, who’s sent flying into the air. The replays suggest that was just about on the right side of legal. Which is fortunate for Lascelles given that Pogba was in the Newcastle area.31 min: Pogba finds Martial, who threatens to burst through on the left, only for Schar to stand firm and deny the forward with a no-nonsense challenge. Moments later Martial flicks the ball through to Rashford, carving Newcastle open. When the ball’s whipped off Rashford’s toes, just in the nick of time, it runs to the right for Mata. But before the Spaniard can stroke home from close range, Dubravaka throws himself at his feet to save Newcastle again.30 min: Pogba scoops a shot wide from the edge of the area.28 min: Lascelles overruns the ball and commits himself into a thunderous challenge on Herrera. An obvious yellow card for the Newcastle skipper.25 min: Another chance for United. Pogba slips a pass inside to Mata, who conjures a delightful assist to set up Martial. However the Frenchman slips after taking the ball on his chest and ends up scooping a disappointing volley over the bar. United’s frustration grows. 24 min: Out of nothing, a long ball from the back from United causes all sorts of problems in the Not United defence. Lascelles and Schar run into each other in the Laurel and Hardy style, allowing Rashford to burst clear. Luckily for the comedy duo, Dubravaka’s going about his job more seriously tonight and he ensures that a sliding Rashford can’t poke the ball past him and into the net.23 min: Atsu tries to release Rondon but United defender Phil Jones covers and manages not to score an own goal. “Good evening Jäcob, what’s with all these photos of Manchester United staff smiling broadly?” Justin Kävänägh says. “I didn’t think Alexis Sanchez even knew how to smile any more. What a difference a visit from a kindly old veteran filled with good will from Lapland over Christmas makes.”22 min: “It’s Newcastle United so please stop referring to Manchester just as United in your updates,” weeps John Manning.20 min: Still no goals for Rashford or Pogba or Martial. Get Fellaini on. That’s how it works, right?18 min: Perez drops deep and drives a lovely pass over the top to Atsu. Where’s Valencia gone? The right-back’s leaving his man a lot of space. However Atsu’s first touch takes him wide and he lacks a clinical touch again, dragging a lame effort across the face of goal from the left of the United area.15 min: United counter after that scare and almost silence the increasingly noisy home fans, only for Martial’s shot from the left to rip into the side netting. Close. This might turn into a good game!14 min: Atsu threatens again on the left after poor defending from Jones. The winger stands up Lindelof and dribbles past the Swede. He’s cut inside on to his right feet and he tries to surprise De Gea with a low stabbed effort. The United goalkeeper is alive to the danger, though, ing to his right to hold. Moments later Newcastle cause more problems. Jones, who scored a majestic own goal against Valencia last month, is hassled into conceding possession by Perez after dawdling near his own area. It’s so dozy and the pressure from Perez sees the ball run through to an onside Rondon, who’s clear on goal. However the striker doesn’t react quickly enough - was he expecting a flag? - and lets Jones race back to make a recovery tackle.13 min: Newcastle lob an up and under into the United area and Atsu, more alert than Herrera, darts in from the left. The winger controls well but he’s quickly under pressure and only manages to slide a shot straight at De Gea, who makes an easy save.10 min: Martial runs on to a long ball down the right and tries to outpace Lascelles, who leans in and knocks the United forward over on the edge of the area. Andre Marriner isn’t interested in United’s appeals for another free-kick. Newcastle will argue it’s a contact sport.9 min: Martial wins a free-kick on the left after being fouled by Yedling. It’s quite far out and the angle isn’t great, but Rashford decides he wants to have a go after scoring at Cardiff. The striker tries to catch out Dubravka with a wobbling low effort towards the near post but the Newcastle goalkeeper es to his right to make the save. He can’t keep hold of the ball, though, and it squirms clear. There’s a moment of panic in the Newcastle defence but they eventually get the situation under control. Or, to be more precise, Phil Jones was the player trying to do something with the loose ball.8 min: This feels like Crystal Palace v Chelsea on Sunday, with the hosts sitting back and the visitors seeing most of the ball. The question is whether United can break Newcastle down. Or whether Newcastle will chance their arm with an attack or two.7 min: Yedlin clips Pogba’s heels on the left. United resist the temptation to send the big men forward from the back. They just keep on playing. Newcastle eventually win the ball back for a brief spell of possession, but they don’t keep it for long.5 min: Diame picks up possession on the halfway line and pings a long pass straight out for a goal-kick. Excellent.4 min: United attack down the left, Martial dribbling into the area and exchanging passes with Mata. Yedlin stops the ball reaching Martial, who would have been through on goal. The ball comes back to Pogba, who shoots straight at Dubravka from the left. It seems Newcastle are playing a back five, with Dummett joining Schar and Lascelles in the middle and Yedlin and Ritchie as wing-backs.Peep! Manchester United, in their red shirts and white shorts, get the game underway, kicking from left to right in the first half. Newcastle are, get this, in black and white stripes.Here come the teams! We’ll have football under the St James’s Park lights soon.“Why can’t you Brits be bothered to get the basics right?” Charles Bruggman roars. “His name is Fabian Schär (the umlaut modifies the sound). If you cannot find a keyboard with the appropriate accents, the alternative spelling is ‘Schaer’. Brexit does not justify sloppiness.”Brexit means I don’t have to use umlauts any more. About bloody time! Although I do have it in my locker. Watch: Chärles.Rafa Benitez speaks! “It will be a tough game but we are confident that we can win if we do things well. At the same time I say to my players we have to stay focused to the end. Hopefully it will be the same as last season and we can win. The key thing is to do things right. If we do maybe they will be frustrated. But they are a good team.”Ole Gunnar Solskjaer speaks! “The boys have set the standards of where we can perform. The first proper test is when you come away from home. It’s never an easy game at Newcastle, although we had a decent record here when we played. It’s a strong bench. We have a strong squad and that gives us options. I want to put Alexis Sanchez on because he’s been looking sharp in training. He’s been away for a month but he’s really worked hard.”You’ll remember that Alexis Sanchez’s last-minute winner in Manchester United’s comeback win over Newcastle at Old Trafford in October was a real turning point for Jose Mo... oh. But that was a cracking game. Newcastle swept into a two-goal lead at half-time and were unlucky not to be further ahead. They’ll have a chance if they play like that, but they know better than most sides that United are hugely dangerous when they gather attacking momentum.Newcastle make one change after last Saturday’s draw at Watford. Fabian Schar replaces the injured Federico Fernandez at the back.Manchester United make three changes after last Sunday’s win over Bournemouth. Antonio Valencia replaces Ashley Young at right-back, Phil Jones comes in for the suspended Eric Bailly and Juan Mata starts in place of Jesse Lingard. Alexis Sanchez, who was absolutely devastated to see Jose Mourinho go, is on the bench after returning from injury.Hello. Turns out Sir Alex Ferguson headed into Manchester United’s training ground to give a pep talk to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his coaching staff. Just like the old days in a way. In fact sometimes you almost get the sense that United would love nothing more than to transport themselves back to the 90s. Why not get the whole band back together? Fergie and Ole together in the dugout, Giggsy and Becks on the wings, Keano ... well, maybe it wouldn’t work with Keano and Fergie any more. But you get the drift. The 90s: a bloody great time to be alive if you supported Manchester United Football Club.Mind you, the same could be said of Newcastle United supporters. Those were some rare times indeed for St James’s Park regulars. They almost won the title with Kevin Keegan and charge and the football was magnificent, with the likes of Faustino Asprilla, Peter Beardsley, David Ginola, Les Ferdinand, Alan Shearer and Temuri Ketsbaia in attack. This was one of the top fixtures. There was always excitement and meaning when Newcastle played Manchester United.At the start of 2019, however, things are a little different for both of these clubs. Having sacked Jose Mourinho last month, United are in a state of flux and it remains to be seen if their revival under Caretaker Ole will last, even though the Norwegian interim has lifted them eight points off the top four after starting with thumping wins over Cardiff, Bournemouth and Huddersfield. Newcastle, meanwhile, are gripped by gloom and ennui as they pine for someone to buy the club from Mike Ashley. Rafa Benitez’s side are three points above the bottom three after one win in seven and the manager continues to strike a fatalistic tone. Newcastle can’t even go down the 90s nostalgia route they already tried that with Shearer in 2009.Benitez is likely to go defensive this evening. He usually does when he hosts one of the Big Six at St James’ Park, though you wonder if it might be a plan to attack this United side, who are weaker at the back than in attack. That’s something Solskjaer’s already cottoned on to after lifting the Mourinho straitjacket off his players and giving Paul Pogba the freedom to play with his natural swagger. They’ve started to look a little more like the Manchester United of old again. Compared to Newcastle they’re certainly more in touch with their true identity at the moment. But there’s still a long way to go."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dfc5a5afb7a8e6d418e792dea4031738702b5aa/0_2_1960_1176/master/1960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7f1ef52113d723444662fc8dfa9ca4e","title":"secure speedy and at scale how to ensure your futures bright in the cloud","story":"Cloud technology has huge potential to grow businesses, but for data security and success, planning and staff involvement are as important as the telecoms infrastructure that drives itRadical advances in technology have come thick and fast in recent decades, but few have promised to revolutionise the way we work to the same extent as cloud computing.Offering the promise of unlimited data storage and fathomless virtual workspaces, the cloud is certain to remain a central component of our work systems, even as other tech advances are embraced by industry in the future.According to the CIO Tech Poll: Tech Priorities 2018 study, cloud spending is now a major priority for IT leaders. The report found that, after predictive analytics and business continuity recovery, they anticipate their biggest funding outlays will be on public and hybrid cloud systems.Take-up of cloud technology varies by industry, with discrete manufacturing forecast to spend the most – $19.7bn (£15bn) – by the end of this year, followed by professional services –$18.1bn (£14bn) – and banking – $16.7bn (£13bn) – according to International Data Corporation.The impact of this growth on jobs also varies by industry. The World Economic Forum (pdf) predicts that sectors such as business, financial operations and sales will see employment growth until 2020, as a direct result of cloud tech, while other sectors, such as office administration, will see negative growth.“With all new technology trends, you’ll see a scale of adoption with larger – typically more risk-averse – companies at the one end and smaller, more agile companies at the other,” says Gary Walker, chief information officer at AXELOS.Walker says that, in his experience, most industries are now considering some sort of cloud service, but the type and nature of its adoption differs by requirement and budget.These cloud configurations range from infrastructure as a service (IaaS) – a form of cloud computing that provides virtualised computing resources over the internet – to PaaS, a platform-based service that allows users to develop, run and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure. There’s also software as a service (SaaS), a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to users over the internet.Hybrid cloud is also widely utilised, combining on-premise, private cloud and third-party, public cloud services with orchestration between the two platforms. Walker says this is often favoured by firms taking their first steps with cloud computing: “This approach can take more upfront planning, but offers a quicker route to cloud adoption, allowing companies to deliver big benefits at the outset of cloud adoption to win over those holding the purse strings.”Information challengesAs with all technological advances of scope, though, there are potential roadblocks to the growth of cloud technology – the biggest of which is, arguably, security.But Mark Hill, chief information officer at technology recruitment firm Frank Recruitment Group, believes many of these fears may be unfounded. “While some of these concerns have been valid,” he says, “a lot of it is based on myth. Modern clouds, operated by big global providers, are by far the most secure platforms for data for the majority of organisations.”He argues that it’s actually control of data, rather than keeping it from the reach of external and unscrupulous hands, that is the real issue.“When you adopt the cloud, you are handing over both the car and the car keys, and while you can mitigate the risk, this is something that many traditional IT folks still find hard to accept.“A much more legitimate security concern is data residency and conflicting global privacy laws, but while the growing number of regional data centres around the world is helping to combat this, it is still often a challenge to overcome.”A company’s existing IT workforce is central to maintaining the sanctity of this data, but, he adds: “These people often don’t have the modern cloud skills, or willingness to change. They see the cloud as a threat, rather than as an opportunity.”A modern workforceSo securing this buy-in from a workforce is key when it comes to adopting cloud tech. The size and scope of a business can determine how difficult that is to achieve, Walker says.“Smaller organisations tend to be more accepting of large amounts of change, although their tolerance for continual change can be lower than in larger organisations,” he says.“That said, I’ve seen, in the past five years, organisations in highly regulated sectors that are now actively pushing transformational, digital-led change.“Many of these organisations have seen the success of small, agile, often wholly digital organisations, and are seeking to mimic the success in their own companies.”The futureFor the cloud to continue evolving at pace, the adoption of faster data transmission speeds, via tech such as 5G, is hugely important.“It is the fundamental ingredient that will allow companies to enrich the user experience for end users and deliver the next generation of cloud-hosted platforms,” Walker says.He adds that while telecoms infrastructure used to be considered a “luxury”, it is now as essential to corporations and iniduals as access to water and electricity.“Mobile telecoms infrastructure,” he says, “is also helping to drive the move to always-on, always-connected equipment that allows for more efficient delivery of services – delivery of a service to an end user at the right time and place, automatically.”But he warned that despite the drive to expand such technology, it remained essential for the implementation of such new tech to be supported by the right processes.“Companies should always remember that the technology that underpins their agile innovation drive and cloud adoption, and which facilitates mobile working, always needs to be carefully and rigorously architected, designed and executed in a disciplined fashion.”To find out more about IT best practice for supporting cloud success, visit built on ITIL"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4851acee64704a233a3c8bcf883a4b1fb51ef798/0_101_2290_1374/master/2290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f786d269cc94d1630cabf227e8a4e792","title":"follow your passion and change your life","story":"Some students, like Jamie Harding, choose to study what they think is a sensible course for their career. But when Harding realised his true love was the creative arts, he switched courses – and never looked backJamie Harding, 28, has been passionate about film and photography ever since he picked up his grandfather’s camera at six years old. Despite this, when he was choosing a university degree he felt he ought to opt for a traditional subject, and chose English literature with philosophy. However, it wasn’t long before he realised he needed to follow his passion. One year in, he switched courses to study creative media at Bath Spa University. “The uni let me change, which was nice,” he says. “In creative media you can do anything, so I decided to study photography and graphic design.”Students like Harding are sometimes put off studying a subject they’re passionate about because they think another may be more sensible. But choosing a degree closely linked to what you love can be good for your future career, as well as being more personally satisfying.Harding has now graduated and is a self-employed cinematographer. He loves his work. “It’s so exciting that there’s always a jump coming,” he says. “So I’m doing a TV pilot next month and that’s a new experience. Obviously film is terribly stressful, but you get to be smug about your work afterwards, which is really nice,” he says, laughing.Without the creative media course, Harding says he wouldn’t have been able to get where he is now. “One hundred percent it’s helped me to get work,” he says. “My work is 10 times better than when I started on the course.”Following your passion doesn’t mean that you will be taking the less career-focused option.Perhaps you dream of setting up a dance studio and want to study business, management and dance. Or maybe you’re interested in a career in commercial music, criminology, or international development and education.Another reason to pick a course you’re passionate about is that you’ll probably be better at it, Harding says. As you’ll be challenged and stretched intellectually, doing something that you love motivates you to stick in when the going gets tough.Once you’ve picked a course, it may be worth looking into the university’s scholarship programme. For example, students who enrol at Bath Spa University in September 2019 have the opportunity to secure £750 in their first year. There are three ways to qualify: by achieving better than predicted grades by displaying outstanding talent in the creative or performing arts or by achieving exceptional results of at least AAB at A-level, or the equivalent.Harding also discovered that the university offered plenty of advice and assistance in turning his course into a vocation he learned the practical side of becoming a creative professional, such as how to do taxes and set up a business. “I felt thoroughly prepared when I left,” he says. He met people at university with whom he still works regularly today. “Uni is a good way of making contacts and growing your voice,” he says. “If I didn’t go, I wouldn’t have the contacts I have now, which basically pay my rent. You can also use the university’s kit for free,” he says. “And you have three years to make films without having to pay for things like insurance.”Harding has no doubts he made the right decision to switch courses to one he was passionate about. “English and philosophy was fun, but I didn’t have an endgame with them,” he says. “Changing direction was the right thing for me – I have zero regrets.”For more information, visit bathspa.ac.uk"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3318994f724b574ee48a01cfaf4202d5f9c7b299/0_34_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b91ba024cc71993216c3ec641337fd55","title":"have you or your partner recently given birth share your experiences with us","story":"We’d like to hear about your physical and mental recovery after birthMost parents will tell you that nothing prepares you for the arrival of your first child.

Can a love coach show me how it’s done?I once made the mistake of going on a Tinder date with an aspiring comedian. By the time our main courses arrived he had shared his full sexual history, including a graphic description of a foursome with some travellers he had met on a couchsurfing site. I had always assumed these were meant for people who needed a cheap place to stay, but apparently at least one doubles as a hook-up app for casual-sex enthusiasts who hate hotel room charges. Eventually, after a long speech on female independence, he told me that he only paid for dinner when the girl was “very attractive”, so I plotted my escape while we split the bill. I thought he would be happy to call it a night, but no such luck. As I scrambled to find an emergency Uber, he grabbed hold of my foot, asking if he could lick my “sexy” toes all night. I declined his offer and spent my journey home wondering if it’s possible to shower your own skin off.There have been plenty of other disappointing dates over the years, including Andy the monosyllabic advertising consultant, Will the food thief who wouldn’t let me finish a sentence, and a Greek racist who would only eat white dairy products. Other encounters have felt more like the icebreaker at a banking conference than the start of a Romeo and Juliet remake.We all know a bad workman blames his tools, so I decide to speak to my friends about my dating patterns. Never ones to hold back, they tell me that I am too judgmental, writing off good men for all the wrong reasons. Instead of giving someone a chance, I’ll leave after the first date because he can’t use apostrophes or doesn’t turn my stomach into a butterfly-filled frenzy of passion. They also tell me I’m too forgiving of narcissists and commitment-phobes, willing to make excuses for “complicated” blokes who frequently lose the ability to send text messages.Persia Lawson, dating coach and author of The Inner Fix, says that if you are repeatedly drawn to emotionally unavailable people, it is probably a defence mechanism. “People say they’re looking for a committed relationship, but when an available person comes along, they dismiss them due to lack of ‘spark’,” she explains. “In reality, they’re terrified of real commitment. There’s a sadomasochistic pleasure that comes with dating emotionally unavailable men.”As a dreamy flibbertigibbet who grew up with Disney movies as her primary source of spiritual guidance, it is tempting to wait for a prince to climb my hair and carry me off to an all-you-can-eat cheese restaurant. But instead of going 100mph or avoiding people who don’t take your breath away the second you meet, Persia recommends taking it slow. “Try rotational dating, where you meet different people for coffee, walks or a trip to the cinema or a museum. Anything that doesn’t involve late nights and alcohol is good, as drinking can influence your dating decisions in an unhealthy way and give you false confidence.”Her advice makes perfect sense. You wouldn’t expect to develop a close friendship overnight, so why do we expect so much from the people we date? Some of the best and most solid relationships develop over time, without instant infatuation to cloud your judgment.According to Lawson, it’s also important to be honest and avoid playing games. Provided you don’t turn up to a first date with wedding dress patterns and a list of possible names for your as-yet-unconceived child, there’s no reason you can’t be upfront about what you want.But when you have spent 15 years chasing players who have the emotional intelligence of a toothbrush, how do you change your ways and start choosing better men? Lawson says that rather than looking for the person I fancy the most, I should focus on shared values. “You need to have standards for yourself, but don’t be unrealistic or superficial. It doesn’t matter if a man isn’t three inches taller than you or a woman isn’t a certain weight. You can have preferences, but focusing on them too much is part of love avoidance and you keep people out by having strict specifications. The only thing you need to ask is how your date makes you feel about yourself as person. Do you feel comfortable? Do you share the same values? Do you want the same things?”Taking Lawson’s advice, I refresh my dating profile on Bumble and get swiping. After exchanging messages with a web developer called James, we agree to meet after work at a local pub. There will be booze involved, but I have set myself a deadline to come home at 9pm and finish some work. This also doubles as the perfect escape plan in case he turns out to be a homicidal maniac who collects human hair in jam jars. Although I have zero expectations, the date is a success and it is the most comfortable I have felt with a man in months. He is laid-back and has a good sense of humour, the kind of guy you could introduce to your friends without having to get them drunk first. When we say goodnight, he’s reserved and polite, a stark contrast to the men who have kissed me, declared their undying passion and then disappeared into the sunset in a cloud of sexy cologne. There was no instant chemistry, but we exchange a few messages the next day and he’s keen for us to have dinner together when we’re both free.In the meantime I arrange a coffee date with Luke, who works in advertising. Within the hour it’s clear that, while he’s a perfectly nice guy, there’s very little common ground and we don’t share the same sense of humour. I’m grateful I took Lawson’s advice to arrange a coffee date rather than dinner or drinks, where we might feel compelled to spend longer in each other’s company. We exchange a few messages afterwards, but it soon fizzles out.After a second successful date with James at an Indian restaurant, I arrange to meet up with an actor outside the V\u0026ampA museum. Usually I would be wary of flamboyant men, but he seems chatty and outgoing, totally different from the dry-humoured type of guy I usually go out with. I’m not sure if I fancy him, but I’m so impressed by his encyclopedic knowledge of Britney Spears albums that I am up for another date.The next week, James and I enjoy a few more PG get-togethers, before agreeing to meet up at the London Wetland Centre to see the otters. To his credit, he doesn’t complain when I insist we queue up in the cold for a good view at feeding time, and we spend the rest of the day sharing newly acquired trivia about mustelids. He also gets bonus points for not pretending to be with someone else when I jump up and down, squealing: “Look how cute the otters are!”I don’t know if my refreshed approach to dating will lead to happily ever after, but keeping an open mind is helping me to enjoy the process again. For now I’m ready to forget the fairytale myth and enjoy online dating for what it is: a chance to meet interesting people and explore new parts of town. If something doesn’t work out I will, in the wise words of Dory the fish, “just keep swimming” until I find what I’m looking for. Perhaps my Disney education wasn’t completely wasted after all.Some names have been changed.

MPs are expected to hold the delayed vote in the second week of January.With Corbyn’s position coming under increasing scrutiny ahead of the crucial vote, it is understood that a number of high-profile leftwing Labour figures, including Ann Pettifor, a former adviser to the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, as well as the economics commentator Paul Mason, and Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the TSSA trade union, are in advanced discussions about forming a policy commission to make the left’s case for remaining in the EU.Their planned intervention follows the publication of a new study revealing that an overwhelming majority of party members want the Labour leader to back a second referendum, though most remain loyal to Corbyn’s leadership.Corbyn and several of his closest allies have been both publicly and privately sceptical of the policy, and the Labour leader has said in a previous interview with the  that the party would pursue a negotiated Brexit deal even if it won a snap general election.Corbyn said May should return to Brussels once her deal is voted down to find an agreement that Labour could support, including a full customs union.“What we will do is vote against having no deal, we’ll vote against Theresa May’s deal at that point she should go back to Brussels and say, ‘This is not acceptable to Britain’ and renegotiate a customs union, form a customs union with the European Union to secure trade,” he said.But Labour frontbencher Chi Onwurah, in a move backed by the TUC, said the party’s policy should be to push for an extension to article 50, rather than to allow May to run down the clock towards no deal.In an article for the , Onwurah, the shadow minister for industrial strategy, said the threat of no deal was “an act of supreme economic sabotage” and would not be carried out. “We must recognise the challenge of negotiating a deal that obtains cross-party support before the March deadline,” she said. “Labour’s conference motion does not reference an article 50 extension, but we have acknowledged it may be necessary.“Increasingly, it is clear that the options to avoid an economic and social catastrophe are a general election, a public vote andor article 50 suspension. With each day that passes, Theresa May’s inept blackmail makes it harder to do anything responsible without stopping the clock.”Negotiations for any future permanent customs union with the EU would be likely to form part of the next stage of talks, once the UK has agreed the terms to leave in March. MPs are due to vote on the negotiated withdrawal agreement as well as a political declaration on the future relationship, which is not legally binding.After a lull over the Christmas recess, pressure on May is also expected to step up again in earnest as MPs prepare to return to Westminster. Over the festive period, May embarked on a round of telephone diplomacy with EU leaders, speaking to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Christmas Eve and again on Wednesday, as she attempted to negotiate a new legally binding wording to provide reassurances on the Irish backstop arrangements.The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, is to meet junior ministers from all other government departments to receive updates on no-deal planning at midday on Thursday, the  understands.A Whitehall source described the meeting as a “stock-take” and said all departments had assigned one junior minister the responsibility for no-deal planning, after the cabinet agreed to significantly increase preparations before Christmas. No other cabinet ministers are expected to attend.The party’s policy, which was decided at its annual conference in Liverpool, is that there is a priority to force a general election and only after that could a second referendum be considered.“The issue of another referendum was of course one of the options, but that was very much after the votes have taken place in parliament,” Corbyn said on Wednesday. “We haven’t yet had a vote, and I think the government really should be ashamed of itself. This vote has been delayed and delayed and delayed. This government is just trying to run down the clock and create a sense of fear between either no deal or May’s deal.”Backbenchers urged the Labour leader to plot a path towards a second referendum. MP Phil Wilson said the leadership was “hidden behind myths” that Labour voters were evenly ided on the issue, when the study had shown they were overwhelmingly in favour of remaining.Luciana Berger, another supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said it was wrong-headed to believe that either Corbyn or May could negotiate a better deal. “No renegotiations are on offer and the EU have been clear that the Irish backstop is unavoidable in all circumstances,” she said. “All the evidence shows that Labour voters and Labour members are at one in their support of a People’s Vote. It’s time the leadership stopped hiding behind process and faced up to the scale of the crisis and took the side of the people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/769a40b36db247de1507bd46f256dd9a4371b08f/218_500_4311_2587/master/4311.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a605bd1e9702626a7e8dc97bc2b90faa","title":"may to provide clearer language brexit backstop says hunt","story":"Foreign secretary confident deal will be approved as PM holds phone talks with MerkelTheresa May will present MPs with new “clearer language” on the nature of the backstop agreement, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has claimed, as the prime minister held telephone talks with the German chancellor and other EU leaders.Talks with the heads of EU countries and the DUP have been quietly going on during the festive period, Whitehall sources have confirmed, as May prepares to face mutinous MPs when she returns to the Commons having promised legally binding concessions.A German government source confirmed Angela Merkel had spoken with May on Christmas Eve and again on Wednesday, as part of a series of calls the British prime minister has made to EU leaders over the festive period as she attempts to guide her Brexit deal through the Commons.Downing Street remained silent on the details of the calls and has not revealed the list of EU leaders, but a No 10 source said May had more calls lined up this week. Berlin said it could not comment on the private conversations.Cabinet ministers have privately urged the prime minister to prioritise securing an agreement which would bring the DUP, which is propping up her government, back onboard.The Northern Irish party has vowed to vote down the deal unless legally-binding changes are made. Private talks have been held with DUP MPs since May pulled the parliamentary vote she had intended to hold in December after it became clear she would face a massive defeat.Sammy Wilson, the DUP’s Brexit spokesman, said in a now-deleted tweet that he was in London for a government meeting, believed to include the chief whip. “Off to London for meetings with senior ministers. We aren’t interested in meaningless assurances,” he tweeted. “The legal text is what counts and the prime minister has promised changes. Let’s see!”MPs are to restart the debate on May’s withdrawal agreement on their return to parliament on Monday.Ahead of their return, the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, will convene a meeting of junior ministers on Thursday to discuss updates to the preparations for a no-deal exit.May has said she is seeking further legal reassurances from EU leaders about the permanence of the backstop agreement, which would keep the whole UK in a single customs territory with the EU until both sides agreed on an alternative solution to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.Hunt, who is in Singapore, said May would eventually get her Brexit deal approved. “I think that she will find a way to get this deal through parliament and I know that is what the British people would want,” he told an audience Q\u0026ampA.The foreign secretary said a no-deal outcome could cause disruption for a prolonged period, adding: “That is not something any government should wish on its people.”Speaking later to the BBC, he reiterated May’s desire to find a solution that would have legal force. “She has also been very straightforward about this – the EU has agreed the backstop is temporary and that’s a word they have agreed,” said Hunt.“So what we’re saying, very simply, is we’re not asking for anything new but we are asking you to define what temporary means so we can have confidence we’re not going to be trapped in the customs union for ever against the wishes of the British people.”Hunt, who has attempted to burnish his pro-Brexit credentials in recent weeks, said there was a need to unite leavers and remainers but that should not be via a second referendum, adding it would be a “devastating blow to democracy”.Instead, he said the deal had to be “a friendly separation where we have the closest possible trade relationship, the closest possible diplomatic relationship with our European friends and neighbours, because I think that is the biggest fear of the remainers”.Hunt had initially floated the idea of a second referendum, which he now opposes, days after the 2016 result, saying the deal needed “democratic endorsement in some form”.The Labour MP Virendra Sharma, a supporter of the pro-remain Best for Britain campaign, said: “While he seems to have decided it’s no longer advantageous for his personal leadership prospects to back a people’s vote, the arguments for putting this decision back in the hands of the people have grown, as the consequences of the political uncertainty come home to roost and our parliament remains in deadlock.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e915410f33fbd730e58450925c11b1fa3e3f35d/178_231_3226_1935/master/3226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=570d83d4df0698cca0ea3756b0373880","title":"people crossing channel not genuine asylum seekers javid","story":"Lawyers and campaigners have criticised Sajid Javid after the home secretary appeared to suggest asylum seekers should be deterred from crossing the Channel in small boats by making it harder to gain asylum, a right enshrined in international law.The Refugee Council called the comments “deeply concerning” and said the suggestion of denying asylum was unlawful. The criticism was echoed by the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, who called the comments “a disgrace”.Speaking on a visit to Dover, Javid questioned why people making the journey had not sought asylum in the first safe country they entered.“A question has to be asked: if you are a genuine asylum seeker why have you not sought asylum in the first safe country that you arrived in?” he said. “Because France is not a country where anyone would argue it is not safe in any way whatsoever, and if you are genuine then why not seek asylum in your first safe country?”“Also, if you do somehow make it to the UK, we will do everything we can to make sure that you are often not successful because we need to break that link, and to break that link means we can save more lives,” he added.Colin Yeo, a leading immigration and asylum barrister at Garden Court chambers, said the home secretary’s apparent threat was illegal. “Sending genuine refugees to face persecution in order to dissuade others from seeking to come here is plainly illegal,” he told the .“I imagine the home secretary knows this, but if so it is depressing that he is still saying it as a way of trying to make himself sound tough. The latest asylum statistics show that around three-quarters of Iranian asylum claims succeed, so we are talking here about genuine refugees.”Dr Lisa Doyle, director of advocacy at the Refugee Council, said it would be unlawful for the UK to deny someone asylum as a way of deterring others from making a claim.“The 1951 refugee convention acknowledges that refugees may enter countries through irregular routes and should not be penalised for this,” she said.“The outcome of an asylum application cannot be pre-judged, irrespective of how that person reached the country. It’s a shame that the home secretary seems to need reminding that seeking asylum is a right and the UK has an obligation to assess claims fairly and grant protection to those who need it.”Abbott said that the comments were part of a Conservative “obsession with maintaining a hostile environment” for refugees and migrants. “Suggesting that the British government would deny legitimate asylum claims is not only a disgrace but a breach of the 1951 refugee convention,” she said.Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs select committee, also said the comments were unwise. “Asylum claims have to be determined according to the law and the circumstances of every inidual case, not as an arbitrary political decision supposedly to deter others,” she said. “The home secretary knows this so to suggest otherwise is completely wrong.”In recent days, Javid has also been criticised after he repeatedly referred to people making the Channel crossing as “illegal” migrants, though it is not against the law to seek asylum.Earlier this week, Javid told Sky News: “Our job here is to make sure this doesn’t turn into a new route for ever-increased illegal migration, so I want to stop it now as much as I possibly can.” Asked about his use of the term “illegal migration”, Javid skirted the question.Paul Hook, the head of campaigns at Refugee Action, said the home secretary’s words needed to be more compassionate.“These are people first and foremost and they deserve a humanitarian response,” he said. “We hope the home secretary will demonstrate that in his words and actions in the coming days and weeks.”Javid said the government was doing everything it could to ensure boats found crossing the Channel were returned to France but acknowledged if Border Force vessels picked up people in UK waters, they would be taken to a port in the UK.The UK announced earlier this week it would deploy two extra Border Force ships to the Channel to try to disrupt the crossings in small and often unseaworthy boats across one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.The numbers crossing the Channel are still small. About 100 have made the crossing since Christmas Day, though Javid cut short a family holiday and designated the increase in the number of crossings a “major incident”.The home secretary said two Border Force cutters would be redeployed as part of wider efforts to ensure the route did not become more popular and said it was a priority to prevent deaths.On Monday, a group of 12 Iranians, including a 10-year-old child, were interviewed by immigration officials after they came ashore near Lydd-on-Sea, in Kent. Six Iranian men were also found on a beach near Deal in Kent on Sunday morning.The Red Cross, which provides refugee support services across Kent including food parcels and clothing, said Iranian asylum seekers were often some of the most destitute.Iranians have made up the highest number of asylum applications to the UK every year for the past three years, although numbers have fallen, according to Home Office figures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/faf4466d84101c66cf34cb2c65f047bf8de872a0/0_87_2621_1572/master/2621.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6196f1c6d0a1c5360eaf820846748108","title":"why the singapore model wont work for the uk post brexit","story":"The city state has a strange appeal to some Tories yet even its prime minister doubts its approach would work in BritainThe foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, on a visit to Singapore to learn how such a relatively isolated city state has become so successful is only the latest, but most explicit, of a long line of Tory ministers to extol it as the model for the UK post-Brexit.Quite how Singapore, an authoritarian state capitalist economy akin to China, has become the pre-eminent Tory model for the UK post-Brexit, as opposed other more democratic economies, is puzzling.Margaret Thatcher was a great admirer of the former British colony, but more recently others who have been intrigued by Singapore’s success include Sajid Javid, the home secretary, Michael Gove as education secretary in 2012 and Owen Paterson, a luminary of the Tory Eurosceptic benches. Others, such as Sir James Dyson, the Brexiter businessman, speak with their wallet. He picked Singapore and not the UK post-Brexit to build his new electric vehicle. Javid at least speaks from experience – he earned £3m a year as head of Deutsche Bank’s Singapore trading ision.Hunt, quickly refashioning his modernising politics to suit an imminent date with a Tory party electorate, is a more surprising advocate for Singapore. He used an article in the Mail on Sunday before his visit on Wednesday to hail its remarkable transformation from a tiny territory devoid of natural resources into the world’s eighth-richest country, adding it was “a reminder of the tidal shifts that can exist within the ebb and flow of the changing world order”.In taking this course, Hunt is taking a political risk both for himself and for Brexit. He risks burning his remaining bridges with the small modernising base in the Tory party, but he also risks associating Brexit at such a sensitive time with an economic and democratic model that may be anathema to wavering Brexit voters.Brexit critics often claim the Tory party vision is for a deregulated Singapore-on-Thames, and here is a senior cabinet minister only weeks before the key Brexit vote travelling 6,700 miles to confirm this to be the case.For EU negotiators, anxious that a bargain-basement Britain does not have privileged access to its single market, the warning could not be clearer.At one level, the parallels with the birth of Singapore and post-Brexit Britain are worth drawing. Singapore was expelled in 1965 from its short-lived union with its larger Malaysian neighbours, something that proved to be a blessing in disguise for a small city state few thought could prosper alone.At the time of independence, Singapore’s GDP per capita stood at just $512. Now it has the eighth-largest GDP per capita in the world and is consistently ranked among the tiger countries, with the highest density of millionaires relative to population. Its achievements in schooling and housing are striking.“We had to create a new kind of economy, try new methods and schemes never tried before anywhere else in the world, because there was no other country like Singapore,” wrote Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s founder in his memoirs, From Third World to First.But here the potential parallels between two nations reborn become more difficult. Lee explicitly refused to cede any ground to democracy while Singapore’s fellow Asian tiger economies were democratising.Beginning in 1963, political rival the Socialist Front – a left-wing split from the ruling People’s Action party (PAP) – suffered mass arrests through the use of the Internal Security Act. Subsequent parliamentary elections have not exactly been cliff-hangers. Thanks to a mixture of bans, libel laws and media repression, the PAP manages to win all but three or four of the 80-plus seats up for contest.Singapore had indeed modernised and developed economically, yet its authoritarian rule went unchallenged. As Milton Friedman, the great free-market economist observed in the 1990s, as much of the world succumbed to democratic rule, Singapore demonstrated that “it is possible to combine a free private market economic system with a dictatorial political system”.Independent trade unions were so weakened that by the 1970s strikes and work stoppages had disappeared. Wages have been kept low through the use of state-sponsored trade unions and the widespread use of cheap migrant labour, something that Brexit is designed to halt. Income inequality has also widened, even if on most measures it is wider in the US.Throughout his life, Lee defended this trade-off of democratic rights for growth, insisting that the former would have precluded the latter. “We decide what is right, no matter what the people think.”Asked on BBC Radio 4 how Singapore fitted into his “invisible chain of democracies” Hunt simply changed the subject. In a speech to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore, he resorted to euphemism: “The British legacy of the rule of law, clean administration, independent courts and the English language have all been part of Singapore’s success.”It is also not clear if Singapore’s transformation into an export-orientated manufacturing base for international capital is relevant to the modern UK. Singapore grew at a time when globalisation allowed multinational corporations to take advantage of different labour and production costs in manufacturing. There is little chance, for instance, of the UK becoming a major exporter of electronic goods based on low wages.Singapore also grew through a form of state intervention more associated with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, than pro-Brexit economist Patrick Minford. Large infrastructure projects were financed from a fund based on state-compelled savings. State enterprise and public investment were at the heart of the growth. Housing is largely publicly owned.Hunt would presumably answer in the negative, inviting the wider question as to what cause he is advancing by his visit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0b66eb0f1c13a762fdd90440ed7bc2eb045cd7e/127_0_7500_4500/master/7500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07df8b53aab46f0c3a4129f27fc07653","title":"chinese spacecraft to become first to land on far side of moon chang e 4","story":"Chang’e 4 will explore giant crater, possibly offering more clues as to moon’s formationA Chinese spacecraft could become the first ever to land on the “far side” of the moon tomorrow, in a milestone for human space exploration. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) is aiming to land the craft in the unexplored South Pole-Aitken basin, the largest, oldest, deepest, crater on the moon’s surface.The robotic probe, Chang’e 4, entered an elliptical path around the moon last weekend, drawing as close as 15km (9 miles) from the surface. China’s mission control has not confirmed a time for the touchdown attempt but reports in state-run media suggested it would be early Thursday morning UK time.Spacecraft have taken pictures of the moon’s far side before, but no lander has ever touched down there. If successful, Chang’e will mark a step towards China’s ambition to become a leading power in space exploration alongside the US and Russia.One technological hurdle in targeting the side of the moon that constantly faces away from Earth is that direct communication with the spacecraft is not possible. Instead messages to and from Chang’e 4 are being relayed by the Queqiao (Magpie Bridge) satellite, which is in a “halo orbit” on the other side of the moon.The mission is aiming to take detailed measurements of the moon’s terrain and mineral composition. The Aitken basin is thought to have been formed during a gigantic collision very early in the moon’s history. The collision is likely to have thrown up material from the moon’s interior, meaning that Chang’e could provide new clues as to how the natural satellite was formed.The far side of the moon is also viewed as an attractive site for radio astronomy. A telescope situated there would be shielded from human radio activity, potentially making it more sensitive to radio bursts coming from the sun or to faint signals from deep space. Chang’e 4 is carrying an instrument to judge the “electromagnetic cleanliness” of the location as a first step to assessing the possibility of placing a telescope there.Lucie Green, a space scientist at University College London, said: “You’re completely shielded from all the emissions that we produce on Earth so you can get data that we couldn’t get elsewhere,. There’s been a lot of talk over the years of the potential of having a telescope on the far side. This mission could pave the way for more serious development on that side.”Since the moon’s revolution cycle is the same as its rotation cycle, the same side of the planetary body always faces Earth. The other face, most of which cannot be seen from Earth, is called the far side or “dark side” of the moon, not because it is dark but because most of it is uncharted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4603b9927003a4ce1385e9ac54c0faf5a1422be/0_109_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a446fae7c2e5d18ea74e1be68c416688","title":"michael schumacher best of hands family f1 great formula one","story":"The family of the seven-times Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher has assured fans he is being well cared for as they prepare to celebrate his 50th birthday on Thursday.Schumacher, who retired from racing in 2012, has not been seen in public since he suffered severe head injuries in a skiing accident five years ago. The German is being cared for at home in Switzerland.“You can be sure that he is in the very best of hands and that we are doing everything humanly possible to help him,” the family said in a statement that made a rare comment about his condition.“Please understand if we are following Michael’s wishes and keeping such a sensitive subject as health, as it has always been, in privacy,” it added.The family said an official Michael Schumacher app will be released on Thursday to enable fans to review all his career successes. The Keep Fighting Foundation has also created a virtual museum.“The app is another milestone in our effort to do justice to him and you, his fans, by celebrating his accomplishments,” the family said. “Michael can be proud of what he has achieved, and so are we ... we want to remember and celebrate his victories, his records and his jubilation.”Ross Brawn, who helped mastermind Schumacher’s success at Benetton and Ferrari, and has visited the former champion in Switzerland, says the driver’s wife, Corinna, and family are right to be guarded over the information they release.“I am constantly in touch with Corinna, and I totally agree with their decision,” Brawn told the Press Association. “Michael has always been a very private person and that’s been a guiding principle in his career, his life and his family always agreed with that choice.“It’s completely understandable that Corinna has wanted to maintain the same approach, even after the tragic event, and it’s a decision we must all respect. I’m sure the millions of people who are still Michael fans will understand it, too.”Schumacher won his first two titles with Benetton in 1994 and 1995 before five in a row with Ferrari between 2000-2004. He remains the sport’s most successful driver, with a record 91 grand prix wins. Britain’s Lewis Hamilton, now a five-times world champion with 73 wins, has already claimed several of the German’s records and could ultimately match his title tally if he continues his current rate of success.“Lewis is certainly capable of matching and surpassing Michael’s other records,” added Brawn, now acting as the head of motorsport for F1. “There’s no doubt that Lewis and Michael are amazingly talented. In fact, it’s their natural talent that unites them. The way in which they achieved their wins is where they differ.“Michael treated his driving career as though it was a mission to which he dedicated himself completely from the first to the last day. In some ways, Lewis has taken longer to find his way, and today it seems he has found that way more from outside the sport than from inside it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1cae057ebf158302dd5030e9ecc46c9bdb20d9b/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c785edf5f6ca9ab23b5de30dae2dcdd2","title":"lynette linton interview artistic director bush playwright sweat donmar richard ii globe","story":"Fuelled by passion and outrage, the playwright and director is shaking up theatre with works about Windrush to an all-women-of-colour Richard II – and now she’s taking over the Bush in LondonLynette Linton is known for her deep love of Michael Jackson. The director and playwright has said that, in a parallel universe, her ideal job would be the King of Pop’s backup dancer. When I ask her why she loves him so much, she replies as though the answer is obvious. Jackson, she says, was a theatremaker. “If you watch his performances, that’s a show, it’s an experience. Everything from his toe to his eyebrow was activated, and you want your audiences to faint like they did when they saw him.” Does she want the audience for Sweat, her current production at the Donmar Warehouse in London, to faint in the aisles? Linton laughs, and points out that Sweat’s playwright, Lynn Nottage, has signed on to write the book for a forthcoming Broadway musical about Jackson. Everything, it seems, is connected.To many in British theatre, Linton is one of the industry’s friendliest and most exciting figures. As an assistant director she has worked with Kwame Kwei-Armah and Michael Grandage she has been an associate director of the Gate in Notting Hill, and she has written for both Theatre Royal Stratford East and the Arcola in east London, her plays exploring mixed-race identity (2017’s Hashtag Lightie), queerness (2013’s Step) and inner-city London’s chicken shops (2015’s Chicken Palace).The recent announcement that Linton will take over from Madani Younis as the  artistic director of the Bush theatre in west London has raised the 28-year-old’s profile to new heights. When she starts this month, she will become one of the few black women running an arts organisation – let alone a building – in the UK. After a year in which record numbers have come through the theatre’s doors and Arinze Kene’s gig theatre show Misty transferred to the West End, the task of taking over could look daunting. But before she gets truly stuck in at the Bush, Linton has a lot to do.In February, she will co-direct a company of women of colour in Richard II at Shakespeare’s Globe, alongside actor and “mentor, friend, auntie, sister, everything” Adjoa Andoh. Later in the year, Linton and her production company Black Apron Entertainment – named after the uniform she and her collaborators Daniel Bailey and Gino Green would wear in their old jobs at John Lewis – will curate a series of films for the Royal Court in response to the Windrush scandal. And Linton is in the midst of her largest directing role to date, Nottage’s Pulitzer prize-winning Sweat.It is, Linton says, is “a beautiful story”, filled with “racial, class, gender, youth tensions … you can break it down on so many levels. Lynn’s writing is so nuanced … I think it does what theatre should do, which is take you somewhere that you might not have seen before, and really understand who these people are.”Linton says she has had “the time of her life” working with the company, and her actors appear equally enthused. Their social media accounts show videos of them all dancing to Lauryn Hill and A Tribe Called Quest. It’s a pre-rehearsal tradition, she says with a smile, that she “stole” from Kwei-Armah.Directing is currently her focus, but Linton considers herself equally a playwright, saying that as a child she “was always writing. I read Malorie Blackman and wanted to be her.”After graduating in English from the University of Sussex, she met the actor, writer and director Rikki Beadle-Blair through the National Youth Theatre. Beadle-Blair, Linton says, “changed my life. He just went, ‘You’re a writer?’ I said yeah, and he said, ‘Have you written a play?’ I said no, just really, really long novels that no one’s ever seen. Then I wrote my first play for him.” Step, a James Baldwin-inspired story about a young man grappling with his sexuality that Beadle-Blair programmed at Theatre Royal Stratford East, was a gateway into theatre not only for Linton, but also for many of the people around her.She quotes Baldwin: “The place in which I’ll fit will not exist until I make it”, a line she keeps on the front of her notepad. “I went for the building because being an artistic director was my end goal. One of the key things about theatre is making sure the building is welcoming, and that starts with the people that are running it. There’s been so many times in the years I’ve been working in this industry, where I’ve walked into a building and gone: ‘I’m not supposed to be here.’ That starts at the top. And until we’re running the top …” she trails off. Who is we? “I’m talking about people of colour. I’m talking about people from working-class backgrounds. I’m talking about women. I’m talking about myself.”"},{"url":null,"title":"unmissable theatre dance comedy 2019","story":"Blanchett and Hiddleston get sexual, there are chills in a Glasgow tower block, Matthew Bourne takes on the star-crossed lovers, plus Catherine Tate, Tim Minchin and Ben Elton return to the road by  Michael Billington,  Lyndsey Winship and  Brian LoganKatori Hall, who had a big hit with The Mountaintop about Martin Luther King, tackles the story of a Rwandan schoolgirl who in 1981 had ine visions warning of a coming genocide.

Dorfman, London, from 16 JanuaryGillian Anderson and Lily James star in Ivo van Hove’s adaptation of Joseph Mankiewicz’s classic Oscar-winning movie about backstage bitchery and fame hunger. Previously turned into a Broadway musical, Applause, the story seems made for the stage with its portrait of loyal dressers, waspish critics and aspiring stars from the Copacabana School of Dramatic Art. Noël Coward theatre, London,  from 2 FebruaryA positive feast of Arthur Miller is on its way. Rachel Chavkin, fresh from Hadestown at the National, directs this little-seen study of the impact of the 1929 stock-market crash on one particular New York family and the wider society. It will be accompanied by the transfer to Wyndham’s (from 5 February) of Jonathan Church’s superb Bath revival of The Price. Then (from 15 April), Sally Field and Bill Pullman star in All My Sons at the Old Vic. But Chavkin gets in first with this neglected panoramic piece. Old Vic, London, from 4 FebruaryGitha Sowerby, daughter of a Gateshead glassmaker, scored an instant hit with her debut play in 1912. It’s the story of the bull-headed boss of a northern metalworks who dreams of handing on the business to his son, but who manages to alienate his family. When he meets his match in his daughter-in-law, it is as if the drama of Ibsen and Granville-Barker is being rewritten from a feminist perspective. Caroline Steinbeis directs this terrific, pioneering play.Crucible, Sheffield, from 8 FebruaryBrecht refuses to lie down. Anna Jordan promises “a sharp new version” of this masterly play about a woman who sacrifices her three children to profit in the wake of a seemingly endless war. Julie Hesmondhalgh plays the woman with a cart in Amy Hodge’s production, and it will be fascinating to see how it strikes the balance between emotional empathy and critical evaluation. Royal Exchange, Manchester, from 8 FebruaryLucinda Coxon has adapted Harriet Lane’s acclaimed first novel about a manipulative, books page sub-editor on a posh Sunday paper whose life is radically changed after she witnesses a car-accident. Part psychological study, part suspenseful thriller, the play is directed by Nicholas Hytner and stars Joanne Froggatt of Downton Abbey fame and Robert Glenister from Spooks.

Jointly presented by Headlong and Bristol Old Vic, it also plays at London’s newly restored Alexandra Palace, as well as in Manchester, Oxford and Northampton. But the excitement will be in seeing how a fast-rising young actor tackles Shakespeare’s satanic ironist. Bristol Old Vic, from 1 MarchFamously without walls, the National Theatre of Scotland takes over a Glasgow office-block to stage three plays set in 2040. The writers are Morna Pearson, Hannah Khalil and Vlad Butucea, and the aim is to show how intimate relationships may be affected by new technology: android carers are at large in an old people’s home, and corporations interfere in their employees’ baby-making. Cora Bissett directs this chilling futuristic trilogy. A Glasgow office block, from 16 MarchOriginally a 1983 Bill Forsyth movie, this Scottish story has now been turned into a musical. Forsyth himself and David Greig have written the book and Mark Knopfler the music and lyrics, and it still focuses on a Texan oil exec who plans to buy up a Scottish seaside village and replace it with a refinery. At a time of resistance to international land-grabbers and growing awareness of local identity, this looks like the perfect musical. Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, from 19 March and Old Vic, London, in June 2020What is South Africa like 25 years after the first post-apartheid democratic elections? That is the question posed in this new play by the towering South African actor-writer John Kani, best known for Sizwe Bansi Is Dead and The Island. Kani also acts in the play opposite Antony Sher as one of two men reflecting on a quarter-century of dramatic change. Janice Honeyman directs a joint RSC-Fugard Theatre production.Swan, Stratford-upon-Avon, from 21 MarchLiam Tobin stars as the demon barber in Nick Bagnall’s production of Stephen Sondheim’s masterpiece. The brilliance of the show lies in its ability to combine a story of personal revenge with a portrait of social cruelty. It also has a strong element of mordant wit as shown in the unforgettable waltz-time number, A Little Priest.Everyman, Liverpool, from 12 AprilTennessee Williams’s take on the classic myth last seen on the UK stage in Hadestown. Here, a footlose guitar-player wanders into a southern town that is a vision of hell on Earth and falls for an ageing Eurydice, whose husband was behind an act of racist violence. Tamara Harvey directs a play that combines Williams’s early romanticism and sweatshirt realism.Theatr Clwyd, Mold, from 15 April and Menier Chocolate Factory, London, from MayMore Arthur Miller, as Marianne Elliott and Miranda Cromwell direct this 1949 classic with a cast to die for. Wendell Pierce, of The Wire and Selma, makes his UK stage debut as Willy Loman. The great Sharon D Clarke plays his wife, Linda, and Arinzé Kene, fresh from the West End run of Misty, is his son, Biff. With a team like that, a play once described as “a powerful tragic symphony” will undoubtedly acquire new resonances. Young Vic, London, from 1 MayLenny Henry heads the cast of a key play by the late, great August Wilson. Set like most of his work in Pittsburgh, it’s the story of a smooth-talking hustler trying to rebuild his life and start a family against the background of Reagan’s America in the 1980s. Nadia Fall, who has made a fine start in her tenure at a historic theatre, directs a play that promises to be one of the year’s highlights. Theatre Royal, Stratford East, London, from 15 MayEllen McDougall directs Thornton Wilder’s 1938 hymn to small-town daily life, which seems to have gained new popularity in our fraught, hi-tech age. As Harold Clurman once wrote, “There is a bit of this play’s snowball purity in the social memory of every American.” It will be fascinating to see how it adapts to an alfresco theatre in an English summer. Open Air theatre, Regent’s Park, London,  from 16 MayDavid Farr has adapted the admired 2012 film by Thomas Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm. Like Vinterberg’s earlier movie, Festen, it deals with allegations of child abuse in a Danish setting. A key difference is that the milieu this time is a tight-knit, lower-middle-class community, and that the accused is innocent. Rupert Goold directs this chilling Danish morality tale. Almeida, London, from 17 JuneThe Comédie-Française pay a rare visit to Britain with Ivo van Hove’s spectacular staging of a Luchino Visconti movie. Like the film, the play is about a decadent family of German industrialists in collusion with the nascent Nazi regime. Archival footage and live recordings blend with the action in a show that puts 30 actors and technicians on stage. Barbican, London, from 19 JuneJack Thorne as writer and John Tiffany as director have previously collaborated on Hope, Let the Right One In and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Now they are reunited for Thorne’s provocatively titled new play, set in 1997, which deals with a family gathering. Given that the play unfolds in the year of Blair’s electoral triumph and that the hosts have named their children after socialist heroes, it sounds promisingly political.Royal Court, London, from 27 JuneThe modern narrative ballet could be seen as a form in crisis, but not in the hands of Cathy Marston, whose sensitive handling of storytelling and steps has both clarity and texture. She has spent much of the last decade working outside the UK, now we’re finally getting to see more of Marston after her excellent Jane Eyre for Northern Ballet in 2016, she’s now creating another work for the company, based on the life of Queen Victoria.Tour opens at Leeds Grand, 9 MarchOn what would have been Merce Cunningham’s 100th birthday, 75 dancers across three cities will dance a total of 300 solos by the legendary choreographer. As well as performances in LA and New York, 25 dancers in London, including Siobhan Davies, Jonathan Goddard, Harry Alexander and Royal Ballet dancers Francesca Hayward and Matthew Ball, will dance a solo from every world or European premiere that’s been previously presented at the Barbican. A brilliant birthday party.Barbican, London, 16 AprilFew choreographers can excavate and illuminate music in the detailed way of Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker, and so this interpretation of Bach’s cello suites is well worth investigating. The six suites are played in their entirety by French cellist Jean-Guihen Queyras, while five dancers, including De Keersmaeker, bring sound into three dimensions. De Keersmaeker’s ascetic aesthetic isn’t instantly gratifying to everyone, but even when she makes you work for it, the rewards are rich. Sadler’s Wells, London, 24-25 AprilA new Matthew Bourne show is always a major event in the dance calendar. The man who gender-swapped Swan Lake and turned Sleeping Beauty into a vampire tale tackles the ever-popular Romeo and Juliet. Bourne will be putting a contemporary spin on the tragic lovers and aims to keep it fresh by working with young associate choreographer Arielle Smith and drawing on a huge pool of youthful talent found through local auditions and community projects.Tour opens at Curve, Leicester, 13 MayYou’ll be totally spoiled for choice in this two-week residency from San Francisco Ballet, making their first visit to the UK since 2012. There are four programmes featuring 10 works, all UK premieres, all made in the last few years, including Arthur Pita’s Björk Ballet, set to Ms Guðmundsdóttir’s music and by all accounts bonkers. Plus, Alexei Ratmansky does Shostakovich, and a chance to see pieces by Justin Peck, Stanton Welch and Trey McIntyre.Sadler’s Wells, London, from 29 MayIt’s two years since character comic Tate brought her alter egos out of cold storage for a national tour. That show, directed by Sean Foley and delivered with relish and considerable skill, was better than we’d any right to expect from a TV tie-in – even if a few of the jokes were, like her best-loved character Nan, showing their age. Now, after a tour of Australia and New Zealand, Tate’s stage show is back to bovver the West End.Wyndham’s, London, from 7 JanuaryAmong several terrific 2018 shows hitting the road this year (James Acaster’s prominent among them), the latest outpouring of heartsickness and hope from Jessie Cave is not to be missed. Sunrise follows on from 2015’s I Loved Her, bringing us bang up to date with Cave’s efforts to be happy and single while co-parenting with promiscuous fellow comic Alfie Brown. It offers neurotic humour in excelsis, big insights into the human condition, and big laughs.Tour opens at Warwick Arts Centre, 24 FebruaryAn intriguing prospect, this: ex-YouTuber Guz Khan – the man behind one of 2018’s funniest BBC comedies, Man Like Mobeen – teams up with Palestinian-American act Mo Amer, last seen supporting Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart at the Albert Hall. Fans of Man Like Mobeen, and anyone who’s seen Amer on his Allah Made Me Funny tours, can expect caustic but playful comedy about membership of a maligned minority.Tour opens at Leicester Square theatre, London, 28 MarchThe standup silverbacks are out in force later in 2019: Eddie Izzard and Jerry Seinfeld both take to the stage with new shows. So too – for the first time in almost 15 years – one of comedy’s most isive figures, Ben Elton. Is he alternative comedy’s biggest sell-out? Or a great entertainer whose talent s novels and musicals, sitcom and live comedy? Answers (perhaps) on the UK’s standup stages, this autumn.Tour opens at Cheese \u0026amp Grain, Frome, from 14 SeptemberTim Minchin spent four years making an animated movie, Larrikins – only for it to collapse when DreamWorks studio changed hands. Awful news for the Matilda composer, but good news for fans of musical comedy – of which Minchin is, with Flight of the Conchords, the world’s funniest and most talented exponent. Subtitled Old Songs. New Songs.

We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

It is set in the fictional kingdom of Agrabah, and was filmed in Wadi Rum in Jordan, where the protected desert landscape, sandstone and basalt mountains, canyons and otherworldly rock formations – such as Burdah Rock Bridge, one of the highest natural arches in the world – create a dramatic landscape.Exploring by 4x4 is recommended, and visitors can also stay in a Bedouin desert camp, go camel riding, and visit the 4,000-year-old rock drawings at Khazali Canyon. Booking directly with the Jordan visitor centre on arrival is advised, or with a tour company in advance (such as Jordan Tracks, 1 day 1 night, cameljeep tour from £90).• Released May 2019Quentin Tarantino’s ninth (and supposedly penultimate) film has a stellar cast including Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie and Al Pacino. Full details of the crime drama have yet to be unveiled, but last April the director told the CinemaCon convention: “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood takes place in 1969, at the height of the counterculture, hippy revolution and the height of new Hollywood. Street by street, block by block, we’ll transform Los Angeles into the Hollywood of 1969.”Photos and videos have surfaced showing a stretch of Hollywood Boulevard, between Las Palmas and Cherokee, transformed with period cars, shop fronts and cinemas. But while most of the sets are temporary, it is possible to visit some permanent fixtures featured in the film, including Hollywood’s oldest restaurant, Musso \u0026amp Frank Grill, which opened in 1919 and whose reputation was set during the golden age of Hollywood, visited by stars such as Charlie Chaplin.Other Hollywood locations for reliving the retro vibe include Dan Tana’s Italian in West Hollywood, the city’s first late-night restaurant, where stars would dine in anonymity: it celebrated 50 years last year. Next to the art deco Pantages Theater, there’s Hollywood’s oldest e bar, Frolic Room (which originally opened as a speakeasy in 1930, was a bolthole for Barfly writer Charles Bukowski, and featured in LA Confidential). And the Hollywood Museum in the restored art deco Max Factor building, has tons of memorabilia and a historic pink lobby.• Released July 2019Almost 25 years after the animated classic hit the screens, a CGI version featuring the voices of Beyoncé, Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Seth Rogen is being released. Research trips for the original animated film took place in Kenya’s Hell’s Gate national park in Kenya – though Pride Rock was a fictitious element added by the animators.Hell’s Gate national park,90km from Nairobi, is named for the intense geothermal activity within its boundaries. The spectacular landscape includes deep, twisting gorges, volcanic rock towers and plumes of steam. ABig cat numbers here are low, which means that, uniquely in Kenyan parks, pedestrians are allowed full access. But other wildlife is abundant, with more than 103 species of birds, buffalos, zebras, gazelles, hyenas, antelopes and baboons. Hire bikes and local guides (for hiking and walking safaris) are available at the entrance those wanting to explore by car can hire 4x4s at Nairobi airport). If a distant hyena lullaby sounds appealing, there are three campsites in the park (Endachata, Naiburta and Oldubai) and more options at nearby Lake Naivasha. • Released July 2019Jessie Buckley stars as a Glaswegian ex-con and single mum who dreams of breaking into the country music scene in Nashville. But Glasgow has its own Grand Ole Opry, a country and western club started in 1974 in a former cinema and still putting on gigs every Friday and Saturday. In March, the city, along with London and Dublin, will co-host Europe’s biggest country music festival C2C: Country to Country (8-10 March at SSE Hydro) with Keith Urban and Lyle Lovett on the bill. Glasgow is also a Unesco city of music, putting on more than 150 gigs a week in around 40 venues across the city. Music hotspots include King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut, Broadcast, Bloc+, SWG3, Stereo, Maggie Mays, and Mono, which is also a record store and vegan cafe.• Released April 2019The original film title – Everest – might have given a clue to the location of this animated film from DreamWorks. Although story details have yet to be disclosed, it is thought to follow a group from the streets of Shanghai who trek 3,000 miles to reunite the mythical Yeti with his family at the highest point on Earth, in the Himalayas.Since the first successful ascent to the summit of Everest in 1953, the Himalayas have become more accessible, with walking routes across Nepal, India, Pakistan, Tibet and Burma, and varied options depending on season, budget and ability. Trekking in China more specifically includes a multitude of routes around Tiger Leaping Gorge in Yunnan province, taking in deep ravines, snow-capped ranges, rivers, forests and remote rice terraces. Alternatively, there are routes at Sichuan’s Gongga Shan, the King of Mountains, passing glaciers, temples and views over the Tibetan meadows or in the far north-west of China in Kanas national park, in the Altai mountains that creep in from Siberia.Tours of the Himalayas in Nepal, India, Pakistan, Tibet and Burma, range from self-guided trekking suitable for families (World Expeditions, £990pp, 11 days B\u0026ampB), to trekking up to an altitude of 5,364 metres to Everest Base Camp (£1,740, 17 days, including all meals and accommodation).• Released September 2019Calanque de Méjean, an picturesque inlet near Marseille in southern France, was the location for this family drama by veteran director Robert Guédiguian. The tiny port beside the towering arches of a large viaduct sets the scene for the reunion of several siblings, who return to the family home when their father suffers a stroke.Guédiguian said Méjean had always reminded him of theatre: “The colourful little houses built into the hills seem to be no more than facades ... A viaduct overlooks them and its trains look like child’s toys the openness towards the sea transforms the horizon into a backdrop ... like painted canvases ... especially with the winter light, when everyone has gone. It becomes an abandoned set – melancholy and beautiful.”Méjean is one of several coastal hamlets along Provence’s Côte Bleue, with a picturesque railway route hugging the shore.• Released January 2019Another homecoming film, this time from Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, following Laura (Penélope Cruz), who travels from Buenos Aires back to her childhood home in a village near Madrid to attend a wedding. Abduction, threats and former lovers (namely Paco, played by Javier Bardem) play out in this Spanish drama filmed in the village of Torrelaguna 40 miles from the capital.Torrelaguna has a beautiful traditional plaza, atmospheric 15th-century church, a Roman bridge, a 10th-century watchtower, and other historic buildings mixing gothic, baroque and neoclassical architectural styles. Restaurants serving Spanishspecialities include Alfoli de la Sal and Casa Moraleda there are horse riding and walking routes in the surrounding meadows and hills and the views from the nearby black-slate village of Patones de Arriba are worth a trip too.• Released March 2019Set in Port Isaac, Cornwall, this feelgood British comedy drama is based on the true story of a group of fishermen who were given a record deal after singing sea shanties in their local pub. On the Atlantic coast of north Cornwall, the tiny village of Port Isaac is a popular filming spot, already featuring in Poldark, Doc Martin and Saving Grace.During the making of Fisherman’s Friends, the original fishermen worked on the boats with the film crew, helped with singing coaching and consulted on accents and dialects. If visiting the area, expect a bit of a sing-song in the local pubs, or during the summer (depending on the weather) you might be lucky enough to catch the Fisherman’s Friends giving a performance of sea shanties on the platt (dock). These shows are free, with donations going to charity. There are boat and fishing trips from the port depending on weather and season, and Polzeath beach, one of the best surfing spots in north Cornwall, is five miles away.• Released March 2019 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

However, 2019 is the year it all comes to an end. And, from what little information exists, it may be a bumpy ride. “We got to the last scene of the sixth episode and really, really embarrassingly, I kind of lost my shit a little bit,” Sharon Horgan revealed back in September. Start date: 7 January(Channel 4) AKA Benedict Cumberbatch’s Brexit film. Playwright James Graham has written this two-hour drama based on firsthand accounts of both the Remain and Leave movements. Cumberbatch plays the latter’s campaign director, Dominic Cummings. Co-starring Rory Kinnear, Richard Goulding and Oliver Maltman, Brexit: The Uncivil War promises to tell the tale of an epic game of cat and mouse – albeit a game where the cat eats the mouse and then poops all over your living room carpet. See Mark Lawson’s feature on Brexit TV.9 January(Sky AtlanticNow TV) True Detective season 1 was a game-changing piece of drama that existed at the meeting point between incredible writing, beautiful acting and sublime direction. True Detective 2 also existed. Hopefully, next year’s third series will be a return to form. The trailers – featuring Moonlight’s Mahershala Ali hopping backwards and forwards in time – look like vintage True Detective. Even more excitingly, one episode counts Deadwood creator David Milch as a co-writer. January(BBC Three) At this point, Phoebe Waller-Bridge can basically write her own cheques. For any other writer, Killing Eve would have been an all-time career highlight, but Fleabag remains her masterpiece. The first series was so perfectly self-contained, hinging on a flawlessly executed final-episode revelation, that it’s hard to know where a second series could go. But doubt Waller-Bridge at your peril. The woman can even fart on command. This will be unmissable. February(BBC One) Incredibly, Alan Partridge has been away from the BBC for 15 years. He’s been no slouch in the meantime, making films, writing books and starring in several perplexingly underwatched Sky specials, but this still feels like a homecoming. Not a vast amount is known about This Time … with Alan Partridge, except that it seems to be an extended One Show riff that will at least momentarily see Partridge standing inside a giant petri dish. This cannot come soon enough. February(Sky AtlanticNow TV) Finally, winter is here. After years of interpersonal squabbling, the rulers of Westeros must finally face the full force of the Night King and his White Walkers, and by all accounts it will be spectacular. Playing out across six ludicrously expensive feature-length episodes that utilise more SFX than ever, this looks set to become the high watermark of everything that television as spectacle can accomplish. April(Channel 4) After last year’s well-received Comedy Blap (Channel 4’s fancy name for a short, if you were wondering), Rufus Jones’s sitcom about a family who unknowingly return from a holiday in France with a Syrian refugee (Youssef Kerkour) in their boot receives a full series. Its tone is gentle rather than stridently satirical – understandable given the subject matter – but the gags are strong, the performances are likeable and the issues depicted could not be more timely. April(Channel 4) Shane Meadows projects are usually funny until they’re not. Punks and skinheads are all having a laugh, until they’re infiltrated by fascists. That creepy guy who is trying to woo your sister is harmless, until he turns out to be unhinged. But with The Virtues, Meadows seems to have reversed the formula. It tells the story of a labourer (played by Stephen Graham) – born in Ireland, put into care and then escaped to England – who goes back to deal with his demons. It’s bracing stuff, but in true Meadows fashion there’s humour interspersed with the grit. Told partly in flashback scenes filmed on handheld VCR cameras, it is visually ambitious – and Graham is magnetic as a man trying to overcome a painful history. April(SkyNow TV) HBO and Sky have teamed up for three big productions in 2019. This retelling of the biggest manmade disaster ever will focus on the people who tried to deal with immediate aftermath: in some cases to cover it up, and in others to ensure it could never happen again. Stellan Skarsgård plays Boris Shcherbina, the Soviet official charged with handling the fallout, Emily Watson is a nuclear scientist who wants to find out why the disaster happened and Jared Harris plays Valery Legasov, the Soviets’ man on the ground after the crisis. May(Channel 4) The first series of Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls was a monster of a show – Channel 4’s biggest new comedy in five years. A classic sitcom premise married to some timely 1990s nostalgia, where all the teens-go-mad action was flanked by the constant shadow of the Troubles. It’s such a perfect formula that a second series cannot feasibly disappoint. Spring(BBC One) Sally Wainwright stays in West Yorkshire, but swaps Hebden Bridge for Halifax as she tells the story of Anne Lister, the 19th-century figure often referred to as the “first modern lesbian”. Suranne Jones plays Lister, who became the head of a powerful family after the death of her four brothers in 1826. The eight-part series tells the story of her rise and eventual marriage to Ann Walker, an heiress of a neighbouring estate. It looks set to be one of the highlights of 2019. Spring(BBC Two) The headline of MotherFatherSon is that it stars Richard Gere in the first major television role of his career, playing a Rupert Murdoch figure in a series that sounds thematically similar to last year’s Succession. But the real draw is its writer: Tom Rob Smith wrote the breathtaking American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, and if he can bring even a fraction of that show’s claustrophobic tension to MotherFatherSon, it’ll be incredible. Spring(Channel 4) Long regarded as unfilmable – despite Mike Nichols’ perfectly serviceable 1970 adaptation – Joseph Heller’s black comedy is now coming to TV. Starring Christopher Abbott as Yossarian and co-starring Hugh Laurie and George Clooney (who also directs some episodes), Catch-22 has the potential to finally nail what was so special about Heller’s novel. Alternatively, it may mark the point where prestige TV finally overreaches itself. We’ll find out this year. Summer(ITV) ITV has so far struggled to find a ratings-winning replacement for Downton Abbey, but might this new period drama fit the bill? Created by Gurinder Chadha (Bend It Like Beckham) it follows residents of a 19th-century Delhi mansion owned by John Beecham, a former soldier haunted by the misdeeds he witnessed working for the East India Company. Set during the era when the British were battling for dominance over India, it should provide a pointed corrective to the dewy-eyed empire reminiscence being peddled as Brexit looms. Date tbc(Sky AtlanticNow TV) HBO’s whodunnit was one of 2017’s standouts with its tense thriller aspect butting up against a tale of small-town myopia and rivalry. The second season sees Jean-Marc Vallée try to repeat the feat while upping the stakes, as Meryl Streep joins Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern and Reese Witherspoon as Perry’s mother. She’s in town to find out what happened to her departed son, and she’ll need all her sleuthing to get past southern California’s scheming elementary-school parents.(Netflix) After a mixed fourth series full of more needless baby murders than anyone could ever really want, Charlie Brooker’s tech-horror anthology is back for another run. Everyone is keeping tight-lipped about what this new series has in store, but we got a festive sneak preview in the form of Bandersnatch – the Choose Your Own Adventure-style interactive episode where you pick the fate of the protagonist from a number of different but equally harrowing options. Date tbc(SkyNow TV) Following in the regal wake of The Favourite and Mary Queen of Scots comes the story of the Russian monarch who reigned in the 18th century. Helen Mirren stars as the titular ruler in a show which looks as if it has all the hallmarks of a prestige drama (big-name star, large budget, co-production with HBO). The four-parter will focus on the end of Catherine’s reign and her affair with Grigory Potemkin, which promises to be salacious and shocking. Date tbc(Netflix) The second regal performance of the year from Olivia Colman, though one that’s a world away from her gout-ridden, lobster-racing Queen Anne of The Favourite. She takes over from Claire Foy as Elizabeth II, as Peter Morgan’s monarchical saga moves into the mid-60s – a turbulent time for the house of Windsor, with Princess Margaret (now played, in a note-perfect piece of casting, by Helena Bonham Carter) attracting column inches for her affair with baronet Roddy Llewellyn. Also joining the cast this time around are Tobias Menzies as a now middle-aged Prince Philip, and Jason Watkins, playing Prime Minister Harold Wilson. Date tbc(AmazonBBC2) Fantasy credentials don’t come much better than those of this Amazon series, which has been adapted by Neil Gaiman from the novel he co-wrote with the late Terry Pratchett. It stars David Tennant as a raffish demon who has formed an unlikely 6,000-year friendship with Michael Sheen’s buttoned-down angel. When a looming apocalypse threatens their bromance, the pair team up to save the world. Psychedelic visuals, epic set-pieces and some wild hairpieces sported by Tennant suggest this could be a blast. If that doesn’t sate your appetite, there’s season two of Gaiman’s other epic fantasy, American Gods, which comes back in March. Date tbc(BBC One) Stephen Graham has been lined up as the latest villain in Jed Mercurio’s police corruption saga, Line of Duty. All we know at the moment is that Graham will be a balaclava man, part of the murky group of criminals whose MO is killing someone you have been intimate with, smearing your DNA on the body, putting the cadaver in a freezer and threatening to ruin your life by framing you unless you obey their instructions. The last season dangled the prospect that the corruption that AC-12 has been sniffing out could be very close to home. In true Mercurio fashion, Graham’s suspect may be a classic bit of misdirection. Date tbc(BBC One) Series four of everyone’s favourite chest-baring period drama ended with a jolting death that suggested the cosy Sunday-night staple still has the capacity to shock. Might more surprises be in store for its fifth and final run? What we do know is that it will see Ross (Aidan Turner) ditch Westminster to return to Cornwall, though the arrival of a friend in need will force him to once again take on the forces of the establishment, not least – one suspects – the nefarious George Warleggan. A final reckoning between the two surely awaits.

The implications of activists being detained and tortured for exercising their freedom of speech and conducting peaceful campaigns is concerning for all iniduals seeking to exercise their human rights in Saudi Arabia.”Blunt said he was hopeful the Saudi authorities might cooperate and thereby allow the panel to report an improving situation to human rights activists.The panel includes lawmakers from ITN Solicitors, on behalf of the firm’s client, who is a Saudi citizen wishing to retain their anonymity.Tayib Ali, a partner at ITN, said: “The detention and torture of Saudi women activists between May and August 2018, the majority of whom had campaigned for the right to drive, undermines Saudi Arabia’s progress and runs contrary to its obligations under international law.“Serious allegations have been made regarding the treatment of these women in detention, including allegations of torture, death threats and denial of access to legal advice.

So we started investigating – and the more we looked, the more bizarre the whole thing appeared.”His father Leen told the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper: “In 30 years of beachcombing I thought I’d seen everything, but never a full urn. You can see an empty one going overboard if ashes are scattered at sea, but three full ones?”The German news site Ostzee-Zeitung reported that it was a complete mystery how the urns had ended up in the North Sea. “Strict rules apply in Germany to the handling of deceased person’s remains,” the site said.“With rare exceptions, it is forbidden to keep ashes in the garden or inside the home, so they are almost always given to the undertaker. Burial at sea is only permitted in special biodegradable urns, which these clearly were not.”A spokesman for the Stralsund public prosecutor’s office, which covers the Greifswald area, told the paper the case was “highly unusual” and the prosecutor was considering whether a crime had been committed – such as disturbance of the dead – that warranted formal investigation.But on Wednesday the Dutch shipping company Trip Scheepvaart of Scheveningen in The Hague said a planned mass marine funeral had gone horribly wrong when the box containing the three urns “slipped from an employee’s hands over the railing”.A spokeswoman, Silvia Roos, told Germany’s DPA agency the company had now buried the contents of two of the three urns at sea and would soon do the same with the third. It was considering how to apologise to relatives for the “most uncomfortable” incident, she said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"People with outstanding fines can call libraries to have membership reinstatedDemand for tickets was \u0026lsquoway beyond expectations\u0026rsquo, organisers sayTim Lombard says \u0026lsquoart of conversation\u0026rsquo is being eroded through the use of the devicesProposed law to enforce minimum passing distance is shelved after AG voices concernsMan (71) denies beckoning teenager to come into toilet cubicle, Castlebar court toldVaradkar warns of \u0026lsquodouble standard\u0026rsquo if diplomats attend male-only events elsewhere\u0026euro54,000 in cash was seized from man linked to cigarette smuggling and drugs tradeToxic gas posed serious risk to emergency servicesEmergency department overcrowding down by half on same day last yearRules for mandatory helmets and reflective clothing \u0026lsquowould be too difficult to enforce\u0026rsquoGarda\u0026iacute from Bridewell Station say they are investigating the incident\u0026lsquoWe want to see the development of good practices of good, comprehensive training\u0026rsquoCompany says it is keen to recruit female driversEmergency services assist passenger who became ill on tram this morningWexford County Council to meet to discuss decision by Irish Ferries to withdraw route\u0026lsquoA bright light has gone out\u0026rsquo after death of Roisin O\u0026rsquoDonovan in BallincolligProf Shane Higgins takes over from Dr Rhona Mahony for seven-year termMen arrested over Raheny shootings suspected in string of similar robberies"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3746276.1546458925!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin house raffle raises 1 4m for roscommon gaa","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMembers of Club Rossie at the Royal Canal Park Development in Ashtown, Dublin 15, where they raffled off a house valued  at €425,000.Roscommon GAA supporters are jubilant after a raffle for a house in Dublin raised just over €1.4 million. More than 14,000 tickets at €100 each were sold by Club Rossie, the supporters’ club association. The new three-bed house in Royal Canal Park, Ashtown has been built by Seán Mulryan who is the main sponsor of Roscommon GAA. Similar houses in the development are on the market for €425,000. The supporters will hand over €943,400 net to the county board once the house has been paid for.It has been won by Kumar Gangah, an Indian software engineer who lives in Lucan. Club Rossie spokesman David Leydon said the success of the raffle was “way beyond expectations” and that on average they sold €12,500 worth of tickets every day while the draw was going on. He added that interest in the house went far beyond Roscommon supporters and that the draw emphasised the attractions of winning a home in Dublin rather than the cause for which the funds were raised. They sold tickets in every county in Ireland and in 26 countries worldwide. Most of the tickets for the house were sold online. “We had a super product,” he added, “a new house in Dublin 15. Using digital technology at every stage of the campaign was the key to it. People trusted that we were running it in a professional way.” Some of the money will be spent on the Dermot Earley Centre of Excellence at Runnabracken just outside Roscommon town. A portion will be used to upgrade Hyde Park to make it fit to hold Connacht finals. “It is going to set Roscommon a really sound financial footing for the coming years,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"Belfast 1994 archives: American embassy official described meetings with NI politiciansBelfast 1994 archives: Cahal Daly told NI minister an internal

I think you’ve a better chance of changing heart and minds through relationship-building and persuasion rather than turning your back on people,” he said.“I don’t think we could or should apply a double standard by boycotting male-only Catholic events in the US while still attending male-only events in the Vatican or the Muslim world or even gender-specific events organised by LGBT groups or women’s rights groups.”In an email to Mr Varadkar, Ms Vargo shared a statement issued by the male-only Society of the Friendly Sons of St Patrick in New York notifying members that they were encouraged to invite female guests to its 235th anniversary dinner in March.“I am writing to strongly encourage the Irish Government to stop sending diplomatic representatives to these men-only membership organisation events.

The image risked the future relations between the two countries, she said.“This is but one example why the very future of this relationship is in doubt. I can’t tell you how difficult it is to interest people in becoming involved in a contemporary US-Ireland relationship when this is their image of Irish America,” she wrote in the email, released under the Freedom of Information Act.“The Irish Government is seen to endorse such organisations when it sends representatives to these dinners. Are women supposed to be impressed by this? I hope the Government will do the right thing here.”In a statement last year, the President of the Society of the Friendly Sons of St Patrick, Kevin Rooney, said that for the first time in the society’s history, women would be welcomed as guests of the 235th anniversary dinner.“In 2019 the society will again expand its reach, this time with regard to the audience it welcomes to its anniversary dinner, by encouraging its members to bring at least one guest, preferably a female guest, to the dinner. This ‘expansive’ approach is consistent with our long history of supporting all people – especially women.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3746008.1546441487!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"corbyn urges may to return to brussels to seek new brexit deal","story":"British Prime Minister Theresa May will find a way to get her Brexit deal approved by the British parliament, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Wednesday (January 2) during a visit to Singapore.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn at a protest about rail fares and train service standards outside Kings Cross St Pancras station in London on Wednesday.  Photograph: Dominic LipinskiPA WireJeremy Corbyn says his priority is to vote down Theresa May’s Brexit deal and secure a new deal with the EU, a day after it was revealed an overwhelming majority of party members want the British Labour leader to back a second referendum.Mr Corbyn said Labour’s Brexit policy was “sequential” and suggested no decision could be made about backing a second referendum until parliament voted down the deal on offer. MPs are expected to hold the delayed vote on the deal in the second week of January.The Labour leader said Mrs May should return to Brussels to find a deal Labour could support once her version was voted down, including a full customs union.“What we will do is vote against having no deal, we’ll vote against Theresa May’s deal at that point she should go back to Brussels and say this is not acceptable to Britain and renegotiate a customs union, form a customs union with the European Union to secure trade,” he said.A study of Labour members found 72 per cent believe their leader should back a second referendum. The research, part of the Party Members Project led by Prof Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London, found that while Labour members still strongly supported their leader overall, they appeared to be sceptical about his reasons for refusing to support a referendum.The party’s policy is that there is a priority to force a general election and only afterwards a second referendum could be considered. Mr Corbyn and several of his closest allies have been both publicly and privately sceptical of the policy and the Labour leader has said the party would pursue a Brexit deal even if it won a snap general election.“The issue of another referendum was of course one of the options, but that was very much after the votes have taken place in parliament,” Mr Corbyn said on Wednesday.“We haven’t yet had a vote and I think the government really should be ashamed of itself. This vote has been delayed and delayed and delayed. This government is just trying to run down the clock and create a sense of fear between either no deal or May’s deal.”MPs are due to return to the debate on Mrs May’s negotiated withdrawal agreement after they return to Parliament next Monday.Mrs May has said she is seeking further legal reassurances from EU leaders about the permanence of the backstop agreement, which would keep the whole UK in an single customs territory with the EU until both sides agree on an alternative solution to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland. Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is in Singapore, said Mrs May would find a way to get her Brexit deal approved by parliament“When Theresa May comes back with those reassurances that she has been seeking from the EU that the deal that is on the table is not going to lead to us being permanently trapped in the customs union ... she will find a way to get this deal through parliament,” Mr Hunt said during a question-and-answer session following a speech in Singapore.Asked about the prospect of holding a second referendum on the deal, Mr Hunt said that would be damaging to democracy and the social consequences of not leaving the EU would be “devastating”. –  "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3745434.1546366134!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach urged to stop sending diplomats to men only us events","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Louise Phelan, president and Mark Redmond, CEO of the American Chamber of Commerce (centre) join members of the Friendly Sons of St Patrick Cincinnati choir under the direction of Dan Shea at the 2014  Independence Day Lunch in Dublin.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Although he ed into the cave and carried stretchers to save the schoolboys, he was not acknowledged in this year’s awards.Other ers involved in the rescue received MBEs, the George Medal for bravery and the Queen’s Gallantry Medal.Although Mr Acton has lived in Thailand for over a decade and runs a hotel there, his parents have argued that the British government should commend him for his bravery.His father, John, said the villagers of Wrabness, where his son grew up,  are setting up a petition.He told The : He didn\u0027t go in there for any awards or a pat on the back but to help the kids.We just feel it is so unfair. It\u0027s immoral that they awarded everyone except Tim and left him out.He\u0027s British, he has a British passport. I just think it\u0027s disgraceful. Hopefully it is a clerical error - I don\u0027t know why it could be. Everybody\u0027s appalled, the people in the village want to start a petition.He said he\u0027s not that bothered about it, but it\u0027s the principle.”While the Cabinet Office does not comment on people left off the New Year’s Honours list, Mr Acton thinks his son was left out because he was part of the Thai ers team rather than the British one.The er’s mother, Lynne Acton told the Colchester Gazette:  “I would hope it is just an administrative error which has come about because he was from outside the British association and got involved because of his work with the Thai Navy Seals.”The bravery of the 39-year-old, who during the rescue sustained a knee injury which left him in hospital for days, has been commended by the Thai Navy.The Commander of the Royal Thai Naval Special Warfare Command, Apakorn Youkongkaew, wrote in a letter to the Thai authorities: “This is to certify that Mr Timothy James Acton... was integrated within the Thai Ex Navy Seals Unit as a Volunteer, he participated as both Diver and Stretcher Carrier within the cave and throughout the search and rescue in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in Chaing Rai Provence, Thailand.“It is my understanding that a Thailand Elite Visa is being awarded to all foreigners who participated within this matter, therefore I request you include Mr Timothy James Acton for the well-deserved award.”Please review our commenting policyRaul Castro says Donald Trump has put the US on a \u0026#39path of confrontation\u0026#39 with CubaChina\u0026#39s male beauty vloggers go viral as gender attitudes shiftJeremy Hunt wants to \u0026#39get to the bottom\u0026#39 of reports forced marriage victims charged for their rescueSkiers in France face dangerous, icy runs with many slopes closed Brazil\u0026#39s Bolsonaro gives farm ministry power to decide on indigenous landChina\u0026#39s Chang-e\u0026#394 mission aims to land on Moon\u0026#39s far side Why David Cameron can no longer enter Parliament unaccompaniedBad news for football fans as World Cup 2022 hosts Qatar double tax on alcoholAttack in which German driver mowed down migrants being treated as terrorismDonald Trump \u0026#39doesn\u0026#39t know what\u0026#39s about to hit him\u0026#39 as Democrats take control of HouseBouncer killed at Mayfair party on New Year\u0026#39s day had moved to UK from Romania \u0026#39for a better life\u0026#39Policeman who wrestled Manchester knife attacker to ground says instinct took overPoland drops plan to legalise \u0026#39one-off\u0026#39 cases of domestic violence Migration behind introduction of cholera to Yemen, study findsLake District walkers demand CCTV after dozens of gates are hacked offIllegal immigrant could be deported for third time after he was caught driving Mercedes at 130mph BBC goes vegan with vegetable-packed cookery show hosted by former daredevilBerry craze sees fruit overtake vegetables in shoppers\u0026#39 baskets Comment: Who\u0026#39s running Britain - our woolly-headed government or the pudding tax-pushing quangos?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/01/02/TELEMMGLPICT000184502127_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4ClFGGjcI28awSNtOPAVs6pc.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"chinas chang e4 mission aims land moons far side","story":"An image of the rover for China\u0026#39s Chang\u0026#39e-4 lunar probeA Chinese spacecraft is attempting to make the first ever landing on the far side of the Moon on Thursday, in a milestone for space exploration.The China National Space Administration (CNSA) is preparing to land the robotic spacecraft in the South Pole-Aitken basin, the largest, oldest and deepest crater on the moon\u0027s surface.The probe, the Chang\u0027e-4, entered a planned orbit on Sunday to prepare for the first-ever soft landing on the far side of the moon, Xinhua news agency said, citing the CNSA.The CNSA has not given the exact time of the attempt to touch down on the unexplored lunar surface, but reports in China\u0027s state-run media suggest Chang\u0027e-4 could begin descending early on Thursday morning.Targeting the far side, or the dark side of the Moon is riskier and more complex than previous ventures, including Chang\u0027e-3\u0027s mission to the Moon in 2013, since direct communication with the spacecraft is not possible and the terrain is rugged.The lander for China\u0026#39s Chang\u0026#39e-4 lunar probeThe Moon is tidally locked to Earth, rotating at the same rate that it orbits our planet, so the far side - or the dark side - is never visible from Earth. Previous spacecraft have photographed the far side of the moon, but none has ever landed on it. The Chang\u0027e-4 is attempting to land in the Von Kármán crater, a flatter region located within the South Pole-Aitken Basin, which is over 2,500km in diameter, and thought to have been formed by a giant collision early in the Moon\u0027s history.The spacecraft, which includes a lander and rover, is carrying a set of instruments aiming to take detailed measurements of the crater\u0027s terrain and mineral composition as well as conducting a biological experiment.If successful, Chang\u0027e-4 will pave the way for China to deliver samples of lunar rock and dust to Earth. The venture is an important step in China\u0027s ambitions to overtake the US and Russia as a world leader in space exploration, which include plans to put a person on the Moon and sending a mission to Mars by 2025. This daring mission will land nearly 50 years on from the historic Apollo landings and will be followed in late 2019 by a Chinese sample return mission, Andrew Coates, professor of physics at UCL\u0027s Mullard Space Science Laboratory in Surrey, told the BBC. Prof Coates added that the information gleaned from the mission will be hugely valuable in understanding the formation of the Moon.Scientists also believe the far side of the Moon is a good place to perform radio astronomy. The Chang\u0027e-4\u0027s spacecraft is carrying an instrument that will test the electromagnetic cleanliness of the location to assess the possibility of eventually placing a telescope there. The lander will communicate with Earth via a relay satellite named Quqiao, which China launched into space in May and is in orbit on the other side of the Moon.  The Chang\u0027e-4 mission is part of a larger Chinese programme of lunar exploration, with two return missions planned to deliver lunar rock and soil to Earth for research.Raul Castro says Donald Trump has put the US on a \u0026#39path of confrontation\u0026#39 with CubaChina\u0026#39s male beauty vloggers go viral as gender attitudes shiftJeremy Hunt wants to \u0026#39get to the bottom\u0026#39 of reports forced marriage victims charged for their rescueSkiers in France face dangerous, icy runs with many slopes closed Brazil\u0026#39s Bolsonaro gives farm ministry power to decide on indigenous landWhy David Cameron can no longer enter Parliament unaccompaniedBad news for football fans as World Cup 2022 hosts Qatar double tax on alcoholAttack in which German driver mowed down migrants being treated as terrorismDonald Trump \u0026#39doesn\u0026#39t know what\u0026#39s about to hit him\u0026#39 as Democrats take control of HouseBouncer killed at Mayfair party on New Year\u0026#39s day had moved to UK from Romania \u0026#39for a better life\u0026#39Policeman who wrestled Manchester knife attacker to ground says instinct took overPoland drops plan to legalise \u0026#39one-off\u0026#39 cases of domestic violence Migration behind introduction of cholera to Yemen, study findsLake District walkers demand CCTV after dozens of gates are hacked offIllegal immigrant could be deported for third time after he was caught driving Mercedes at 130mph BBC goes vegan with vegetable-packed cookery show hosted by former daredevilBerry craze sees fruit overtake vegetables in shoppers\u0026#39 baskets Comment: Who\u0026#39s running Britain -

After the highs of 2017, which saw the price of bitcoin surge to $20,000 (£15,700), the world\u0027s most valuable cryptocurrency is currently trading close to its lowest point in 16 months.Bitcoin has fallen\u0026nbspby 3 per cent over the last 24 hours, adding to losses of 5 per cent in the last week, 10 per cent in the last month and almost 80 per cent over the last year – leaving little doubt\u0026nbspthat last year\u0027s peak was indeed the result of an over-inflated bubble.There have been five major price spikes in bitcoin\u0027s 10 year history, and after each previous crash the market has managed to recover to even higher levels. But the scale of the 2018 losses have left some cryptocurrency experts questioning whether bitcoin will once again see a market turn-around.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialPredicting bitcoin\u0027s fortunes in 2019 has therefore ided analysts, with forecasts from high-profile figures within the cryptocurrency industry ranging from a complete capitulation, to a 10-fold increase from today\u0027s price of $3,650.The most radical predictions come from bitcoin cash founder Calvin Ayre and Fundstrat\u0026nbspco-founder Thomas Lee.

We’ve also lined up a panel of worthies from the City. Our sincere thanks to all of them for being such good sports and putting their heads above the parapet.\u0026nbspI’ve changed the rules a bit this year: our panel was told they could vary their predictions based on possible Brexit outcomes, because, well, who could possibly make an accurate prediction for where that will end up?\u0026nbspBut before we get down to business, the usual warning. This feature is designed to be fun. If you’re going to put actual money down, do your own research into stocks and the markets and consider taking professional advice too.As the editor of this feature, I get to go first. That’s not something I relish looking into the fog that surrounds 2019. But here goes.\u0026nbspMarkets are due a rally after this year’s sell off, the FTSE 100 in particular. It’s suffered from the complete lack of appetite for UK assets, something else to thank Brexit for. But it is also worth remembering that it’s dominated by international companies that make most of their money overseas. It means there is real\u0026nbspvalue to be had for the savvy investor, and perhaps a lot. If some kind of Brexit deal is reached, or better still we have a referendum and stay, I’m going for a relief rally (at some point) and an end of year close of 7,200, which I admit might look optimistic. If it’s no deal, then we’re in real trouble. The markets will hate it, so maybe 6,800. Why not worse? If\u0026nbspthe pound really collapses, the UK’s foreign currency earning stocks could start to look absurdly cheap. But I’d advise heading out of the country if you have the option.Stock pick: HSBC (646.9p). CYBG (181.2p) if Brexit is resolvedI’ve no great love for HSBC, which has had a chequered regulatory history in recent years. That said, while it has a big UK business, its most important markets are\u0026nbspin the far east and it reports earnings in US dollars. The third quarter results were unexpectedly good and the shares have climbed since then. But it’s still offering a prospective idend yield of 6 per cent, with no signs that the payout is under any threat. That’s right, 6 per cent. Eventually people will wake up to a number like that. With the UK in turmoil, there are good reasons for investors to look to this most international of banks. If you think Brexit will end well, and the sugar plum fairy actually exists, however, take a look at challenger bank CYBG following its acquisition of Virgin Money. That was a sweet deal and yet the business trades on just six times earnings.\u0026nbspIf this ends better than I expect, its current price\u0026nbspcould look ridiculously cheap this time next year.While global stock markets looked like they were heading in the right direction earlier this year, they’re moving\u0026nbspinto 2019 on a markedly different path. The FTSE 100 hit record highs in May off the back of the weakened pound. However, while sterling continued its decline throughout the rest of the year, it was not enough to sustain the stock market’s strength. The root of all this volatility was, of course, Brexit, and it doesn’t seem like that’s going to be cleared up any time soon.If the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal, the pound is likely to see a crash of its own – but as we now know, that doesn’t necessarily mean a rally for the FTSE anymore. It could head back towards multi-year lows as investors scramble to distance themselves from the UK. Even if Theresa May manages to get some sort of deal through parliament, it will be some time before we know what sort of impact the new arrangement is having.It seems foolish to make any predictions but I’m going to target a FTSE 100 close of 7,000 – which seems wildly optimistic at this point in time.IAG is the owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberia, among others. The FTSE 100 company has paid out pretty hefty idends in recent years, and it’s relatively cheap at the moment – the share price was knocked severely by a cyber attack over the summer. Despite concerns that a potential no-deal Brexit could wreak havoc on air travel in the UK, chief executive Willie Walsh has not wavered from his positive outlook and says the company is confident that it will not be harmed by disruption to flying rights – so confident that the group announced a €2.6bn investment plan in November. With oil prices forecast to drop over the next year, fuel costs should be more manageable too.It’s not been a vintage year for global stock markets. Most are lower than where they started. However, that’s the nature of the beast: stock market returns are lumpy. The UK economy continues to limp along, though a pick up in wage growth has been encouraging. Clearly Brexit is the big swing factor when it comes to the year ahead, and until there is some resolution on that front we can expect sentiment to remain febrile.With the FTSE 100, I’m once again going to play the averages (it only works as a strategy if you do it year in year out!) The FTSE adds about 5 per cent a year on average, excluding idends, so from current levels that puts us somewhere near 7,050.Stock pick: Lloyd’s Banking Group (51.85p) assuming\u0026nbspan orderly Brexit.\u0026nbspDiageo\u0026nbsp(2,795p)\u0026nbsp in the event of a disorderly BrexitIn an orderly Brexit outcome my stock pick would be Lloyds Banking Group.\u0026nbsp It currently has a prospective idend yield of around 5.5 per cent. When CEO Antonio Horta Osorio took over in 2011, the bank was making a loss of £260m. Last year it made a £3.5bn profit, yet the share price is lower than when he started. The market is selling down Lloyds because, at best, it doesn’t know what the next year holds for the bank’s profitability while Brexit hangs in the balance. If the UK economy is unscathed we can expect the share price to pick up. In bad outcome, all stocks are likely to come under pressure in the short term. So is the pound. Bets can be hedged a bit by holding an internationally ersified defensive stock like Diageo. The manufacturer of Guinness and Johnny Walker gets most of its revenues from overseas. And let’s face we’ll probably all need a drink in this scenario.Political shenanigans in Westminster and the ongoing negotiations with Brussels mean that offering any sort of forecast for the UK economy in 2019 is a pretty thankless task. You can see the pound going to $1 in the event of a Brexit outcome that markets don’t like and it going back to $1.50 if the negotiations are seen as finally yielding a positive result, so at $1.25 sterling is probably appropriately priced right nowWhen it comes to the FTSE 100 the darkest hour comes before the dawn and with pessimism so pervasive the market may have a better chance of making it to 8,000 by the end of 2019 than many suspect. It is trading at levels last seen in December 2016 and even languishes below the high reached at the climax of the technology bubble in December 1999. As such, a good degree of bad news may already be factored into the valuation of UK assets, especially as the pound is still trading some 13 per cent below where it stood on the day of the EU referendum in June 2016. Unloved often means undervalued and the UK is not expensive relative to its international peers or its own history on an earnings basis.\u0026nbspIt also offers a prospective yield of 4.9 per cent, which beats base rates pretty handily and also outstrips the 1.25 per cent yield of 10-year UK government bonds.I’m normally wary of banks but in the case of the FTSE 250 “challenger”\u0026nbspOneSavings Bank I am prepared to make an exception. The stock trades on barely 6.5 times earnings and 1.4 times book value while offering a idend yield of 4.1 per cent. If everything goes wrong from a political or macroeconomic perspective, the lowly valuation could provide some relative downside protection, while the yield may offer some compensation for the risks involved as investors tough it out. A Brexit deal triggering a rally in sterling, and a resurgence in interest in UK assets, will put stocks like OneSavings Bank in the vanguard of a recovery, especially as loan growth is robust. The firm’s return on equity of 26 per cent is outstanding relative to its peer group. Given the bank’s exposure to mortgages, smaller companies and its strong focus on buy-to-let there are clear risks. Any economic and house price downturn could test sentiment and profits. But the valuation is low.Brexit, Donald Trump’s trade war and budget tensions between Italy, France and eurozone authorities will be major drivers of markets as politics dominates the start of 2019. The future shape of the UK’s relationship with the European Union remains unclear. A chaotic Brexit is likely to result in a fall in the pound, which is positive for the FTSE 100 as the majority of its earnings are generated abroad. However, a sharp rally in sterling could be negative for the index and any gains will be capped. Hopefully Donald Trump will be pushed in the direction of getting some sort resolution with China over the trade dispute so he can declare a “win” sooner rather than later. This will be positive for markets worldwide. The biggest risk is that the US Federal Reserve oversteps the mark and slams the brakes on the US economy too hard. However, there are signs that the central bank may be more doveish than many expected My FTSE 100 prediction: 7,100Growth at this Middle Eastern private healthcare network operator is supported by a strong economy in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the rollout of mandatory health insurance in the country. It also benefits from the UAE’s limited corporation tax regime and is expanding into Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Its new joint venture in Saudi Arabia, which will see it become one of the largest healthcare operators in the kingdom, is due to complete in the first quarter of 2019.Andy Brown, head of direct equities, Tilney Asset Management\u0026nbspLooking into next year, in the near term sentiment towards UK shares will depend in large part on what happens between now and the end of March when the UK is set to leave the EU. Many of the big UK political risks appear to be playing out now in the form of a potentially messy Brexit and with doubts about the sustainability of the current UK government. These anxieties are reflected in current UK equity valuations, which at 11 times earnings, are well below other developed markets and their longer-term trend.It’s important not to confuse UK equities and the domestic economy. In fact well over two-thirds of the earnings of FTSE 100 companies in aggregate are made outside of the UK. Currency volatility is likely to remain a feature which will have both an operational and financial impact of many UK companies. Not only are UK equities at discounted valuations, idends remain an attractive feature of the UK market both compared with\u0026nbspother regions and bond yields. We expect the FTSE 100 to eke out small gains by the end of 2019, perhaps finishing at around 7350, but with idends on top.DS Smith is a leading supplier of packaging products with a genuine global presence.

We are not short of key themes to ensure a bumpy ride across the year Trade wars, China slowdown, US Federal Reserve tightening (or not), Brexit and Italy all point to 2018’s volatility continuing if not rising in the year to come.The already challenging task of crystal-ball-gazing is almost impossible heading into 2019. With so much uncertainty surrounding Brexit and just three months to go to the break, perhaps the only certainty for the pound and the FTSE 100 is the continuation of this new uncertain phase.The year just gone has been a nightmare for the FTSE, which is down around 11 per cent this year, despite a 5 per cent drop in sterling. Weakness in the pound is good news for all the international stocks on the FTSE, around 70 per cent of the index itself. However, we expect broader fears of slowing global growth to ramp up across 2019, starting as soon as January with a softer US earnings season.Predictions for the FTSE would need to be split depending on the type of Brexit Theresa May secures. A disorderly, no-deal Brexit could see the pound plummet which would offer more support to the FTSE, as we saw post the Brexit referendum. However, a key difference is that the global economy was in better position in 2016. Under this scenario we envisage a very volatile year with the FTSE ending only marginally higher.A Brexit deal will see the pound recover some ground, adding pressure to the FTSE. A stronger pound, plus growing concerns over global growth would mean a difficult year for the FTSE which could close lower.Making money on stocks in 2019 amid such uncertainty will require careful choices. Gold has not lifted off this year, shedding 5 per cent of its value as a strong US economy and the\u0026nbspFederal Reserve\u0026nbsphiking rates have boosted faith in the dollar. However, with the Fed expected to slow its rate of interest rate rises this year the glitter could return to gold. With the precious metal expected to increase between 5 per cent and 15 per cent miner Randgold Resources will be a stock to watch.It has been a volatile year, although much of this comes off the back of 2017, one of quietest on record. The “synchronised global growth”\u0026nbspidea disappeared fairly early on, and trade wars have certainly not helped matters. The great post-2008 bull market has not come to an end, but it has taken quite a kicking. Things will remain volatile, but some of the bearishness and pessimism is perhaps overdone.If Brexit ends with a dealRemain, then the FTSE\u0026nbsp100\u0026nbspcould hit 7,500, but if no deal 6,000.\u0026nbspThe life insurer has good exposure to Asia, a strong idend, and is reasonably valued. I think this works in both situations.Stephen\u0026nbspAdams, head of equities, Kames CapitalDisorderly Brexit risk, Corbyn risk, earnings risk, monetary policy risk: it is little wonder then that the FTSE 100 is down. Nor is it clear that any of these pressures are abating as we head into the start of 2019. However, on a 12-month view it is possible to see the catalysts for a higher UK equity market.UK equities are the contrarian global asset class,\u0026nbspand any clarity on Brexit short of a no-deal cliff edge would likely be taken well. It is also possible that the economy would enjoy a relief bounce with the release of some pent up demand and a looser fiscal stance. In that scenario I would envisage the FTSE at 7,450 by year end 2019.By mid-year we may also witness a pause in US monetary tightening and a stabilisation in rebased earnings per share forecasts. Even with a no-deal Brexit I could see a FTSE little changed over the year as sterling takes the strain and the high percentage of overseas earnings in the blue chip index receive\u0026nbspa boost on any devaluation, so\u0026nbsp6,800.The deal with Schneider materially enhanced the sales opportunities for Aveva’s world class portfolio of design, engineering, construction and industrial software solutions.

Previous studies have discovered that blue light emitted from the screens of laptops and smartphones can contribute to\u0026nbspblindness.\u0026nbspIn August, research by scientists from the University of Toledo, Ohio, revealed that prolonged exposure to the short-wavelength light triggers the generation of toxic molecules in the eye\u0027s light-sensitive cells.\u0026nbspIs Facebook finished? \u0027We\u0027re not far from Zuckerberg subpoena\u0027This process can lead to macular degeneration, a condition that results in blurred or no vision in the centre of the vision field.While it is thought that dark modes can help reduce eye strain, no studies have provided conclusive proof of whether the feature helps prevent this type of blindness.Facebook Messenger follows several other popular apps to introduce the feature, including YouTube, Google Maps and Firefox.WhatsApp, which is also owned by Facebook, is expected to introduce a similar feature later this year.As well as avoiding shining bright screens into people\u0027s eyes, dark modes can also improve battery life. Phones that use OLED displays do not need to light up parts of the screen that are black, potentially reducing the energy needed while the app is open.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/06/28/17/canterbury-housing.jpg","title":"first time buyer level uk property market research","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

The major update – which would have been perhaps the biggest change to Instagram ever – was so widely despised that numerous users suggested the app is now dead.But very shortly after, the change appeared to be reverted and the feed went back to normal. And now it appears all of that happened by accident.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Sorry about that, this was supposed to be a very small test but we went broader than we anticipated,” Instagram head Adam Mosseri wrote on Twitter, alongside an awkward-looking emoji. The change went to “a few orders of magnitude more people than intended”, he wrote.He said the change “should already be rolled back”. If it is still appearing, he told users they should “simply restart your app and you should be good to go”, Mr Mosseri advised.Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost.

On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts.

The alteration was just intended as a test, he said, giving no indication that it would be rolling out widely and properly any time in the near future.An Instagram statement suggested the change was a bug, rather than an accident, but both Mr Mosseri and the company\u0027s spokespeople were presumably referring to the same incident.“Due to a bug, some users saw a change to the way their feed appears today, the\u0026nbspstatement read.\u0026nbspWe quickly fixed the issue and feed is back to normal. We apologise for any confusion.Confusion as new Instagram appears and disappearsMr Mosseri only recently took up his position as Instagram’s boss, though he has worked for a long time at Facebook, most recently as the head of its News Feed. He was moved into his new\u0026nbsprole after Instagram’s founders left the company, reportedly in the wake of disagreements over its future direction.The roll-out of the change to the feed had already appeared strange: Instagram does usually allow small groups of people to test out new features, before slowly rolling them out to everyone who uses it. But this time around the update appeared to arrive on everyone’s phone all at once, dropping rapidly on Thursday afternoon UK time.When the change happened, it came with a screen that explained why it had arrived and how to use it. That suggested the change was not the result of a bug or that it had happened by accident, but presumably the same screen was only meant to be seen by the small number of people who would get access to the altered feed.Soon after, the new feed started reverting back to normal, before Instagram chose to announce that the update had been a mistake.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":null,"title":"instagram update new scroll left right sideways feature explained","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

For the moment, a new battery costs only £25 – but once the new year arrives, that will rocket up to as much as £65.Old batteries can cause significant problems for their owners as iPhones age. With use, the power begins to drop – something that can lead to phones lasting for much less time, and to Apple having to slow down phones to ensure that they don\u0027t crash because they\u0027re not getting enough power.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIt was the revelation that Apple was doing that – throttling performance on older phones, in line with more spectacular rumours that swirled before it was admitted – that led to the cheap repairs in the first place.When that story came out over the Christmas period in 2017, Apple apologised and said that as part of a range of ways of making it up to customers it would knock down the price of replacements, allowing people to restore their phone\u0027s performance if their battery had been degraded.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

Once the programme is over, the same service will cost £45 for most phones, and a full £65 for the iPhone X.Apple gives governments increased access to phone dataThe iPhone X recently became eligible for the throttling, which Apple still applies to more strained batteries to ensure they perform properly. One of the other forms of restitution offered to users was the option to turn that off, which can be found in Settings.Phones that are covered by its warranty period or extended AppleCare coverage will remain free, as they always have been.As the end of the year approaches, Apple Stores appear to be especially busy with users rushing to take advantage of the offer. Genius Bar appointments can be few and far between, though some customers have had success turning up at stores.The replacements require that a battery is sufficiently degraded, which will be checked by Geniuses at the store but can be seen by heading to the Battery options in the Settings app. But some customers appear to have successfully had batteries that are not under the critical 80 per cent mark swapped out all the same.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/12/gettyimages-669005400.jpg","title":"lady gaga enigma las vegas residency reviews setlist tickets","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Three if I’m lucky!’”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialLady Gaga’s Las Vegas residency is the role she was born to playA history of Las Vegas residencies, from Liberace to Lady GagaKendrick Lamar, Lady Gaga and Thom Yorke up for Best Original Song“There’s a short encore to properly conclude the show once Enigma departs. In an oversized march shirt that has her Bowie-inspired “Poker Face” lightning bolt cutting through a silhouette of her body, she sings one last song: “Shallow,” the runaway hit from A Star Is Born.\u0026nbsp“The moment is a balm, and its one that makes sure the show’s time machine takes us right back to the present, reminding us how far she’s come and the many lives she’s lived after taking us on a tour of her own musical history. She performs ‘Shallow’ as Ally Maine does towards the end of the film after becoming a full-fledged pop idol.”The review concludes: “For a show that at first seemed like an excuse to remind us what Gaga is best at, it ended up becoming a show that confirms and begins her legacy.”“Enigma\u0026nbspis a generous show, by Vegas pop standards, not just by exceeding the standard get-‘em-out-onto-the-slot-machines set length, but because Gaga also happens to do almost two hours more of actual singing than some of her counterparts on the Strip,” Variety said. “Watching Gaga do what she does best — even better than act, still — is all the story or connecting thread a show needs. She and ‘Born This Way’ were both born to be in Vegas, and to raise the bar for superstar residencies just a little bit higher.”Entertainment Weekly said: “Enigma is Gaga’s way of sharing an epiphany that we can only assume she’s recently experienced and strove to manifest creatively in the way that best suits her.\u0026nbsp“At some point, Gaga lost who she was — whether by her own fault, or the machine around her, is only for her to say — but Enigma, in as much as we need from it, serves as her way of affirming that she’s never been more secure in who she is, and that the most atypical parts of Lady Gaga are just as present and valid as the parts we perhaps have told her we’d have an easier time accepting.”Created with Sketch.Albums of the year 2018 Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date.

But the mood has been shifting since Britney Spears began drawing a younger, hipper crowd with her 2013-2017 Piece of Me show, which earned the MGM Park casino hotel around $135m (£107m) in ticket sales alone. While that show was something of a comeback – albeit for a relatively young performer – Bruno Mars signed up for his 2016 residency at the peak of his commercial and critical success and made 24K showbiz magic of it.“Gaga has reportedly been given $100 million reasons to deliver a two-year residency (also at the MGM Park). She’s an even better fit for Vegas than Spears or Mars: she is capable of both visually excessive pop and elegant old-school jazz.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

This time around, almost everyone got the update within a matter of minutes. If people weren\u0027t seeing it when they opened their app, force quitting and scrolling around appeared to prompt the app to update.Why Instagram just completely changed its feedBut now some users report that the change has switched back, with the feed going upright all over again. It\u0027s not clear whether that is a bug – or whether the rollout itself had happened by accident, or early.Instagram had clearly meant for the update to go live at some point, since an instructional card popped up to explain that the change had been made and what users now had to do.There doesn\u0027t appear to be any way to make the feed change back. Instagram is not giving the option to revert to the old feed, even temporarily.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/12/samsung-galaxy-s10-leak-camera.jpg  width= 1254  height= 836  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/12/samsung-galaxy-s10-leak-camera.jpg","title":"samsung galaxy s10 release date price camera specs camera screen leaks","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

The new picture shows the latest object – floating millions of miles from Earth – which sits in the distant and mysterious Kuiper Belt on the edge of our Solar System.This flyby is a historic achievement, said New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern.

New Horizons has set a new bar for state-of-the-art spacecraft navigation.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe object had previously been compared to a peanut for its long ends and thin middle. But the newest pictures show it being shaped more like a snowman, made up of two rounded spheres that are connected in the middle.Nasa said Ultima\u0026nbspThule\u0026nbspwas once two separate objects, made up of what Nasa\u0026nbspcalls a contact binary. It was probably formed when a cloud of smaller, icy objects swirled around and began to combine – eventually, they formed two bigger bodies that swirled around each other until they touched and created the world that New Horizons has since explored.The two objects have probably been joined up for 99 per cent of the length of the Solar System said, Nasa said, nudging rather than smashing into each other in the beginnings of our neighbourhood. As such, it could be a way of looking back into the beginnings of our planets and those that surround us.New Horizons is like a time machine, taking us back to the birth of the solar system. We are seeing a physical representation of the beginning of planetary formation, frozen in time, said Jeff Moore, New Horizons Geology and Geophysics team lead. Studying Ultima Thule is helping us understand how planets form — both those in our own solar system and those orbiting other stars in our galaxy.The team behind the mission have dubbed the big sphere Ultima and the smaller one Thule. The name was bestowed on the object after a public competition in 2018, and is a reference to a Latin metaphor for places beyond the edges of the known world – though has drawn some criticism for its connection to Nazi imagery.The images were taken from just 17,000 miles away, of an object stretching only about 20 miles in length. (Ultima is roughly 12 miles up, while Thule makes up the other nine.)Still, the best colour close-ups won\u0027t be available until February. Those images should reveal whether Ultima Thule has any rings or moons, or craters on its dark, reddish surface. Altogether, it will take nearly two years for all of New Horizons\u0027 data to reach Earth.\u0026nbspThe observations should help scientists ascertain how deep-freeze objects like Ultima Thule formed, along with the rest of the solar system, 4.5 billion years ago.\u0026nbspAs a preserved relic from that original time, Ultima Thule also promises to shed light on the so-called Kuiper Belt, or Twilight Zone, in which hundreds of thousands of objects reside well beyond Neptune.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

Although NASA\u0027s Voyagers crossed the Kuiper Belt on their way to true interstellar space, their 1970s-era instruments were not nearly as sophisticated as those on New Horizons, Weaver noted, and the twin spacecraft did not pass near any objects known at the time.\u0026nbspThe New Horizons team is already pushing for another flyby in the 2020s, while the nuclear power and other spacecraft systems are still good.\u0026nbspBowman takes comfort and pleasure in knowing that long after New Horizons stops working, it will keep going on and on.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s a bit of all of us on that spacecraft, she said, and it will continue after we\u0027re long gone here on Earth.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Clunge. Muffwagon. Goodness, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard those creative expressions of male sexual frustration, and it\u0027s\u0026nbspnice to hear them again, like old friends, or “Fwends” in this case. The Inbetweeners are back. Sort of.Even by the usually self-congratulatory standards of tellyland, the total of four hours and 10 minutes of airtime devoted by Channel 4 to their 2008 hit The Inbetweeners\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspa tad self-indulgent, though it is one of the channel’s recent glories.\u0026nbspHosted, inevitably, by the roughly contemporaneous Jimmy Carr, the first two hours of this teenage marathon, The Inbetweeners: Fwends Reunited, is given over to a sort of mix of This is Your Life, An Audience With..., and Radio 4’s The Reunion. That is followed by four full episodes of the series, mostly for the devotees, I imagine, as well as any stray viewers unfamiliar with this comedic landmark to judge this odyssey of pubic discovery, adolescence and embarrassment at first hand.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn all, The Inbetweeners ran to three series and two films, predominantly onanistic in tone, and most of the cast and creators turn\u0026nbspup for this celebration of its 10th anniversary. The Fwends Reunited show is dominated, naturally, by the four sixth form virginal idiots a good shag would have probably sorted out, but who, fortunately for us, never got lucky. Simon Bird (as Will McKenzie), Joe Thomas (Simon Cooper), James Buckley (Jay Cartwright) and Blake Harrison (Neil Sutherland) confirm the impression that they were basically playing themselves in The Inbetweeners and haven’t changed much since the last piece was smut was propelled like a flying turd into the public’s consciousness in 2014. I just hope their real-time personas have managed to “plunge some clunge” as they approach early middle age. Not sure, though.Given the vast prairie of time to fill, the producers plunder every known format to maintain some kind of momentum, and mostly to good effect, \u0026nbspthanks to the timeless quality of the original gags. So there is a series of “Awards” for stuff like “best bodily malfunction”, and I for one will never tire of seeing Simon projectile vomiting semi-digested creme de menthe on his girlfriend’s six-year-old brother nor of Simon’s left testicle hanging forlornly from his posing pouch in the school fashion show nor of watching Will tearfully confessing to his teacher that “I thought it was a fart”, as he had to be escorted from the A level exam room. You can almost smell the, er, shame.\u0026nbspThe 10 best TV shows of 2018The Inbetweeners\u0027 James Buckley \u0027could have died\u0027 filming boat scene There is a mini-quiz segment too, featuring Inbetweeners “super fans” whose programme knowledge exceeded that of the cast themselves, with a scholarly textual grasp of lines such as: “What is Swansea. Is it an animal?” “What\u0027s this pesto stuff? Is it for humans?” and “Just cos you’ve had your first puff on your first joint it doesn’t make you Kurt Cobain.”One super fan even had a tattoo of a grinning Jay with the inscription “CLUNGE” garnishing her upper thigh – ironically about as close as Jay ever got to a lady’s bodily treasure.The quiz “prize”, won by a Will lookalike in specs and a blazer, is a bright yellow M-reg Fiat Cinquecento Hawaii Edition, complete with “tape deck” and red passenger door.This runabout is also the co-star of the Fwends show and features in the freshly filmed sequences, such as their nostalgic trip back to Rudge Park Comprehensive\u0026nbsp(, as Carr puts it “in a car none of them owned to a school none of them went to”. Will relives the moment when he shat himself, which is, well, moving.Created with Sketch.Best TV of 2018 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair.

A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair.

Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.The talking (dick) heads are good too, especially when creators Damon Beesley and Iain Morris explain the genesis of some of the set pieces, often based on their own life experiences. Beesley, for example, confesses how he had ranted some foul-mouthed sarcastic abuse at some hapless kids for pushing in at an amusement park before bullying his way onto the ride. Smug, he turned to them and only then discovered that the selfish bastards were at the front of the rollercoaster because they had Down syndrome.\u0026nbspGreg Davies’s presence as the bad-tempered teacher Mr Gilbert is also enjoyable. No wonder that Davies went into comedy having himself been a bad-tempered teacher (“a living hell” in his seemingly sincere description). Waen Shepherd (Mr “Paedo” Kennedy) is extremely game to join in the fun –\u0026nbspperhaps surprising given the times we live in. Indeed, I wonder, only a few years on, if phrases such as “spaz” and “rapey” could be scripted now.You could call it a retrospective then, if you were pretentious enough, or “going in balls deep” if you’re Jimmy Carr. Although it lacks a certain pointfulness - the cast are even more absurdly old to play adolescents again and there will \u0026nbspbe no more episodes or movies \u0026nbsp- and all concerned refuse to take itself too seriously, which is just as well. Like a more successful sort of school reunion.\u0026nbspThere’s nothing more tedious than people earnestly trying to deconstruct comedy: much better instead just to get on with the clips and the poo jokes. And so they do, and so does Will get a high speed turd in the face from a water chute, and suddenly we are all back in the sixth form disco again.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

And the betting markets think there is a 40 per cent chance of it happening. But how could it come about?\u0026nbspThe first problem is time. There isn’t time to hold a referendum on a normal timetable, which would take at least six months. Of course, Greece held a referendum on the 2015 bailout in just eight days, but in Britain simply getting the legislation through a hung parliament would be impossible before exit day, 29 March.\u0026nbspIf such an obstacle arose, the UK would have another way to gain more time, by cancelling its notice to leave altogether. The European Court of Justice last month confirmed that we have a unilateral right to do so, but that does mean that, if the people voted again to leave, the Article 50 procedure would have to be started again from the beginning.\u0026nbspHow, then, could a double decision\u0026nbsp– to postpone Brexit in order to hold a referendum – happen? The first attempt will probably be on the day of the big vote on the Brexit deal, which is expected to be on 14 or 15 January. Sir Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, is likely to table an amendment calling for a new referendum, which will be voted on first. It is bound to be defeated, because Labour will not, at this stage, support it.\u0026nbspPressure on Corbyn as Labour members back fresh Brexit referendumAfter the motion to approve the prime minister’s deal goes down to its predicted defeat, however, things could change. Once Labour has tried and presumably failed to force a general election, Jeremy Corbyn will have to decide the party’s next step. This is the significance of the YouGov\u0026nbspsurvey of Labour members, carried out last month for the ESRC-funded Party Members Project run by Professor Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London.\u0026nbspThis found that 72 per cent of party members want a new referendum (18 per cent do not 10 per cent don’t know), and that Corbyn’s rating among them has fallen from 80 per cent in March to 65 per cent now. Having said he would respect the will of Labour members, Corbyn would be under pressure to support a referendum. At the moment, Labour policy is simply that it is one of the “options remaining on the table” if a general election is not possible.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Final Say petition delivered to Downing Street Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Today the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetToday the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetIf the shadow cabinet backed the policy, it is possible that there would be a majority in the House of Commons in favour of a second referendum – although we haven’t even considered the awkward question of what the question on the ballot paper would be. If that can be overcome, it would still require a large number of Conservative MPs to back it, to offset the unknown number of Labour MPs who\u0026nbspwould vote against.\u0026nbspConstitutionally, Theresa May could ignore such a vote, but politically it would be unthinkable to defy the majority of the Commons – and, if she cannot win the vote for her deal, it must be suspected that she would rather go for postponement and a referendum than for a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspThe chances of a new referendum depend, therefore, on Jeremy Corbyn and the precise numbers of anti-referendum rebel Labour MPs versus pro-referendum Tory MPs.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

Everything up until now – the endless disputes, crises and resignations, the huge cost, both in gold and other reforms forgone, are just a prelude for the tougher task ahead.If the UK leaves the EU this year, it will do so with no blueprint for its future trading terms, after Brussels comprehensively torched the Chequers plan in September.To give one example of the tortures ahead, the Commons would have to decide, in the summer of 2020, whether to implement the Irish border backstop the following January – the key controversy currently obsessing MPs.Created with Sketch.

It will take many more years than that.Even if the UK ever puts forward realistic proposals, trade talks will be held up by MEP elections and the appointment of new commissioners – creating a vacuum ripe for new more Tory Euro-wars.And the alternative to embracing the backstop – the UK staying under EU rules beyond 2020, while paying tens of billions of pounds more for the privilege – is scarcely more appealing.Turn a corner?

They initially feared venturing across the Atlantic might lead them into a commercial “bear’s den”.By 1930, the 400th branch of Woolworth was opened in Southport, Lancashire and at the\u0026nbsppeak of the brand’s popularity\u0026nbspin the 1960s, the company had 1,141 branches around the country.\u0026nbspWoolworths\u0026nbspbegan to run into trouble in the 1980s when it pulled out of the Irish market and abandoned its out-of-town hypermarket format stores as a failure. It also vacated its big city centre department store premises like Briggate in Leeds\u0026nbspin favour of open single-storey shops.At the turn of the millennium, the company tried various means to stay afloat, attempting to rival Argos with a “Big Red Book” ordering scheme and hiring celebrities Jackie Chan and\u0026nbspKelly Osbourne\u0026nbspfor their advertising campaigns.\u0026nbspBy late 2008, administrators Deloitte had been called in and all remaining 807 stores were gradually closed, resulting in 27,000 job losses.

We’ve just accomplished the most distant flyby.”Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said: “In addition to being the first to explore Pluto, today New Horizons flew by the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft and became the first to directly explore an object that holds remnants from the birth of our solar system.“This is what leadership in space exploration is all about.”The radio message from the robotic craft was picked up in Madrid by one of Nasa’s big antennas. The data took six hours and eight minutes to traverse the massive breadth of space between Ultima and Earth.According to Nasa, scientists had not discovered Ultima Thule when the probe was launched in 2006, meaning the mission was unique. In 2014, astronomers found Thule using the Hubble Space Telescope and selected it for New Horizon’s extended mission in 2015. “Anything’s possible out there in this very unknown region,” said John Spencer, deputy project scientist for New Horizons. Launched in January 2006, New Horizons embarked on a 4 billion mile journey towards the solar system’s frigid edge to study the dwarf planet Pluto and its five moons. The spacecraft, which is the size of a baby grand piano, flew past Pluto in 2015, providing the first close-up views of the planet. During the flyby, the probe found Pluto to be slightly larger than previously thought. In March, it revealed that methane-rich dunes were on the icy dwarf planet’s surface.After trekking 1 billion miles beyond Pluto into the Kuiper belt, New Horizons will now seek clues about the formation of the solar system and its planets.There is a great deal scientists can learn from Ultima and the hundreds of thousands of similar bodies scientists deem to be in the solar system. Hal Weaver, project scientist on the mission, told the BBC the rock is “probably the most primitive object ever encountered by a spacecraft, the best possible relic of the early solar system”. The object is officially known as 2014 MU69, but was nicknamed Ultima Thule, a Latin phrase which means “beyond the borders of the known world”.Additional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We are willing to use the greatest sincerity and expend the greatest hard work to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification.“After peaceful reunification, Taiwan will have lasting peace and the people will enjoy good and prosperous lives. With the great motherland’s support, Taiwan compatriots’ welfare will be even better, their development space will be even greater.”But he added that “we do not promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option to use all necessary measures” to achieve reunification and prevent Taiwanese independence.Fears Hong Kong is losing its freedom as China tightens grip on cityThe threat of force was aimed at Taiwan’s own independence forces as well as foreign powers who may seek to interfere, Mr Xi suggested, without elaborating in what was likely a reference to the US, Taiwan’s strongest supporter.Mr Xi claimed that unification would be under a one-country, two-system framework that would respect the Taiwanese social system and way of life and guarantee their property rights, religious beliefs and other rights.But similar past pledges over the future of Hong Kong have not prevented Beijing tightening its grip on the city, with activists voicing fears about growing pressure on democratic freedoms.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

They turned it into the wedding of our dreams.A source told The Sun Online: “At the end of the day hes a paedophile and a sex offender, and you need to be careful around people like that.I wouldnt want my wedding arranged by a sex pest.All those poor people who had a wedding organised by him will have to live with that thought.”Clarke pleaded guilty in April  to charges including voyeurism, assault by touching, making indecent photos and outraging public decency.He was originally jailed for six years in February , but a month later had this changed to two years after appealing against the sentence.When confronted by The Sun Online, Clarke claimed he had only accidentally downloaded a video of nude children running on a beach when he was trying instead to watch Superman.He said his sentence for assault had been quashed - a claim refuted by the CPS, who said it was simply altered.He also said he was never alone with children at weddings, but admitted he had not told the TV stars about his vile past.He said: “I’ve been punished for it once and you’re now trying to punish me once again.”When contacted by The Sun Online, a spokesman for Jess and Dom refused to comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000301908618.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"universal credit campaign the sun brits 150 better off","story":"WORKING families on Universal Credit could be £  a month - or £, a year -better offministers implemented the changes that The Sun campaign is calling for, experts have said.Experts at Think Tank Resolution Foundation and charity TurnUs estimated that our package of measures could make a huge dference to hard-pressed Brits struggling on the new welfare system.The Sun’s Make Universal Credit Work campaign is calling for Brits to be paid quicker - reducing the wait for first payments from five weeks to two - to keep more of what they earn and for childcare to be paid upfront to help people back into work.Seven million people are set to be on the new system by the end of , all of whom could benefit from our crucial changes.Campaigners, charities and MPs from across the political spectrum have come together to praise our campaign and demand change before it’s too late. Experts argue that reducing the taper rate - the level at which Universal Credit claimants are taxed when they earn over a certain amount - would make a huge dference to working families.A two-parent family with a child would gain over £ a monththe taper rate was slashed from the current rate of p to p, Turnus estimated.The policy change would cost the Treasury around £.billion.Covering childcare costs upfront - rather than making parents pay and then claim it back - could stop , families going into debt when they go onto Universal Credit, says says Laura Gardiner, Research Director of Resolution Foundation.“It’s something of a free gt – costing the government nothing in the long run,” says Ms Gardiner.“Our new analysis shows that raising Work Allowances for single parents and second earners could deliver a further living standards boost of up to £,, and crucially help many more women into work.“Ensuring that support with childcare costs is paid upfront, rather than in arrears, could eventually help around , low-income families, at virtually no cost to the government.”The average full-time childcare costs for a child under two are £, a month, according to Money Advice Service.A damning report by MPs last month said the system being paid in arrears was stopping Brits from going back to work.  And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Getting Brits paid faster would also help stop thousands from falling into debt when they move over.The Sun has told how countless Brits have been pushed into debt waiting for the first payment to come through.Ministers are already paying  weeks of extra benefits to those claiming housing costs when they transfer, and those on ESA and JSA will get an extra payment by  too, it was confirmed in the Budget.If the payments were also extended to cover those on working tax credits at the moment, it could help  million people who claimed them in  .The DWP could also speed up the time to process payments by using the Faster Payments process for all claims - they currently use them only when payment is needed the same day.The BACS payment they currently use can take up to three days just to clear. The Resolution Foundation is also calling for single parents to get their own work allowance of at least  hours on the minimum wage.Experts calculate that raising the work allowance - the amount people on Universal Credit can earn without losing any benefits -  would help , employees.That means a single mum who was renting could get an extra £, a year - more than £ a month.They also argue that introducing a second earner work allowance of  hours on minimum wage would boost the income of a family with a child by £, a year too.It would cost £.billion to put in place, RF calculated.Laura Gardiner said:“The Chancellor’s recent decision to reinvest in Universal Credit by increasing Work Allowances will deliver a £ living standards boost to millions of families, and shows where further support should be prioritised. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000457033025-e1545842064567.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sajid javid huddersfield asian grooming tweet","story":"A politician who doesn’t retract his comments just because they upset the kind of people who make a career out of being upset.That politician is Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary — though perhaps we should refer to him as the Home Truth Secretary because he has been delivering a fair few of those recently.This week, Javid was offered an opportunity to backtrack on something he said a few months ago.And amazingly — given we live in an era of spineless politics in which MPs are forever repenting for something they said — he turned down the opportunity.Javid’s speech-crime was to tweet about Muslim grooming gangs.In October, he tweeted a heartfelt comment about the Huddersfield grooming gang —  men who were found guilty of  offences against  girls.They pursued a “campaign of rape and abuse” against their vulnerable victims, said the judge at Leeds Crown Court.Javid described their predatory behaviour — including against a teenage girl who had the mental age of a seven-year-old — as “vile and wicked”.In his tweet commenting on the case — he referred to the  men as “sick Asian paedophiles”.Cue instant meltdown in PC circles.For Javid to use the A-word — “Asian” — was nasty and offensive, they spluttered.Like a modern-day Inquisition, the permanently outraged Twitterati denounced Javid for “racialising” the crimes in Huddersfield.Labour MP David Lammy said Javid had increased “the risk of violence and abuse against minorities”.Labour’s Diane Abbott slammed him for “attributing these crimes to one ethnic group”.But here is the thing —we are talking about the Huddersfield crimes, as Javid was, it is absolutely right to “attribute these crimes to one ethnic group”.As the BBC reported at the time, the  Huddersfield groomers were “all British Asians, mainly of Pakistani heritage”.Javid, who is also of Pakistani heritage, was telling the truth. Every word of his tweet was correct — these men are sick, they are paedophiles and they are Asian.When politicians are condemned for telling the truth, for stating plain-as-day facts, you know we live in scarily censorious times.So, this week, Javid was right to turn down an invitation to “rethink” his October tweet.He was on the Today programme on Radio . A guest presenter — the British-Pakistani novelist Kamila Shamsie — asked himhe thought his tweet might have fuelled hate crimes. Coolly, and with rare principle, Javid said that of course politicians must be “careful with their language”.Butyou look at recent high-profile cases of gang-based sexual exploitation, “there is a high proportion of men that have Pakistani heritage”, he said.He’s right.Rotherham, Oxford, Rochdale, Derby, Telford, Newcastle, Huddersfield . . . across England there have been awful grooming-gang cases, where the perpetrators have largely been Muslim men and the victims white working-class girls.We must be free to talk about this. To analyse it. To ask how such a terrible situation came about where vulnerable, mostly white girls are preyed upon by wicked, mainly Muslim men.But we are not free to talk about it. Anybody who raises the issue of Muslim grooming gangs risks being branded as foul, a racist, a troublemaker whose words will fuel hate crimes.Indeed, Javid has been subjected to genuine racist abuse for speaking out on the issue.Vile, hard-left tweeters have denounced him as an “Uncle Tom” and a “coconut”.Such disgusting racist insults reveal where the real prejudice lies in this debate — not in Javid’s concerned comments, but in the PC outrage that effectively says to him: “Shut up, Coconut.” Javid was not being prejudiced but many of the supposed progressives raging against him have been.It is all a sign of the times. From Conservatives such as Javid, to Labour MP Sarah Champion and radical feminists such as Julie Bindel, anyone who expresses concern about Pakistani-heritage grooming gangs can expect to be bombarded with abuse.But a nation that cannot discuss its communal tensions is a nation that is in very serious trouble.That signicant numbers of Muslim men are abusing signicant numbers of white working-class girls suggests “multicultural Britain” is a fractured, sometimes ugly place — and we must be at liberty to talk about this.Shushing debate about Muslim grooming gangs is insulting not only to the victims of those gangs, but to Britain’s Muslim community, too.It suggests they are too fragile, too weak, to cope with honest debate about problems and crimes within their communities.So let us be thankful for Sajid Javid — a politician who is willing to look modern Britain in the face and ask it some dficult but essential questions.This is a Tory to watch.Their latest wheeze is to force restaurants and supermarkets to impose “calorie caps” on their dishes.Public Health England is thinking about stopping supermarkets from selling sarnies that have more than  calories and capping restaurant meals at  calories. This would effectively mean using the power of the state to force us slovenly, greedy plebs to go on diets.It’s so paternalistic.Here’s a radical idea – bugger off and let people eat whatever they want.Our lunchtime triple-decker sandwich and occasional restaurant blowout are none of your business.TALK about a self-fulfilling prophecy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

set to nosee over the coming days bringing harsh frosts, freezing fog and even a risk of heavy snow.Severe cold will grip the country this week putting the elderly, sick and very young at risk, according to Government health advisers.The Met Office with Public Health Englandhas issued a level- alert and readiness cold weather alert across northern and central parts of England into the weekend.Thermometers will plummet almost C from the start of the week in parts with bitter winds making it feel close to -C in exposed spots.Met Office meteorologist Helen Roberts warned freezing winds sweeping in from the Arctic circle will herald a big change in the weather.She said: “It is going to feel noticeably colder as we go through the rest of the week, we expect fairly widespread frosts, freezing fog and very chilly temperatures especially in the breeze.“Temperatures in the north will struggle to get much above freezing while where they will generally hover in single figures through the week.“There may be more of an Atlantic influence by the weekend which will lt temperatures in western Britain, but it is still going to feel cold widely.”Pressure patterns responsible for the recent calm conditions have shted to pull freezing air in from the north, she said.She added: “We have had a re-organisation of high pressure which is now bringing cold northerly air originating from Iceland into Britain.“It will be very cold overnight and there could be some stubborn fog to deal with on Thursday morning.PHE warned severe cold weather, icy conditions and heavy snow could wreak havoc into the weekend.Slow-clearing freezing fog and below-average temperatures may see the alert ramped up before the end of the week, it said.Elderly and vulnerable people are urged to wrap up and take extra care while out and about to avoid falls on icy pavements.The PHE warning states: “Prolonged periods of cold weather can be dangerous, especially for the very young, very old or those with chronic diseases.“This weather could increase the health risks to vulnerable patients and disrupt the delivery of services.“Cold weather criteria may still be met in some central, southern, and southwestern areas over the weekend where any freezing fog patches are slow to clear.“This may require the alert level being raised in these areas later this week.”Malcolm Booth, chief executive of the National Federation of Occupational Pensioners , added: “Very cold weather can strike quickly and catch people unaware, especially the more vulnerable.“It is vital that people prepare for cold weather ahead and make sure their homes are heated and they have enough in to keep them going.“Elderly people should also take extra care while out and about as it is easy to fall on icy pavements and the consequences can be serious.”Long-range forecasters say this could be the start of a y cold spell with winter set to lock in for the next month at least.A split in the so-called Polar Vortex driven by rising stratospheric temperatures threatens a repeat of last winter’s Beast from the East.What could be the strongest Sudden Stratospheric Warmingever observed is about to set in driving the cold weather, according to climate experts.An SSW event was responsible for triggering the extreme cold which virtually ground Britain to a standstill at the start of last year.This time round it could be worse with temperatures in the Polar stratosphere expected to rocket before the end of the month.Climatologist Judah Cohen from the US AESsaid temperature rises of up to C over the North Pole threaten to drive the strongest SSW ever recorded.While the potential impacts are still under discussion it could bring heavy snow across Europe, Eurasia and the US, he warned.He said: “NASA Model [s] [are] predicting close to all time record warmth at the North Pole in the stratosphere.“Temperatures are predicted to warm by nearly C or F in just a few days.“The most robust cold signal following a signicant PV [Polar Vortex] disruption is Northern Eurasia consistent with the temperature forecast.”SSW which triggered the Beast from the East big freeze in March happens when air over the North Pole warms and compresses.This stops mild westerly winds reaching Britain while opening the floodgates to freezing easterlies.A Met Office spokesman said: “There are increasing chances we could see temperatures turn colder as we move into the New Year.“This is connected to disruption of the winds high above the earth’s surface, in an event known as a Sudden Stratospheric Warming .“This increases the chances of colder-than-average weather in January and the rest of winter.”James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, said January threatens to bring the coldest spell of winter so far.He said: “January is shaping up to be a colder than average month overall, while temperatures may deviate at times we expect to see some of the coldest temperatures of the winter within this period.“There is also a risk of several widespread snow events and over all we expect temperatures to be at well below-average for the month.”Thermometers are forecast to e below freezing across the nation at the weekend with daytime highs in low single figures.Windchill charts show feels-like temperatures of -C across parts of Wales and central England by the weekend with widespread lows of between -C and -C.It will bring a start contrast from the start of the week when the mercury hit .C in Boyne, Scotland, over the New

never had a peanut allergy before, had a severe allergic reaction after eating a peanut butter and jam sandwich.Baffled by the sudden onset of the allergy doctors ran tests and discovered her blood had high levels of peanut-specic immunoglobulin, which causes an allergic reaction to the nuts.Two weeks before her reaction the patient had a lung transplant from a donor who had a peanut allergy.The antibodies that trigger an allergic reaction to peanuts were passed onto the woman through the donor lung, medics believe.Her case was published in the journal Transplant Proceedings.Dr Mazen Odish, a fellow in pulmonary and critical care medicine at the University of Calornia - San Diego Medical Center, who treated the woman said it was very rare for a patient to get a food allergy from a donor organ.There have only been about five reported cases of it happening after a lung transplant, he told Live Science.In this case, the woman needed a lung transplant to treat emphysema, a condition that damages the sacs in the lungs and makes it dficult to breathe.Her donor was a -year-old man.The day before she was scheduled to be sent home from hospital she developed tightness in her chest and was struggling to breathe.She underwent multiple tests but doctors couldnt find a cause for her condition.It wasnt until she said her symptoms started as soon as she ate peanut butter in her sandwich that medics realised it was an allergic reaction.Doctors contacted the transplant agency and discovered the donor had suffered with a peanut allergy.Although its rare for food allergies to be transferred from organ donors to transplant recipients, it can occur.Cases of food allergies being acquired from organ donors have been reported after liver, kidney, lung, bone marrow, heart and kidney transplants, the authors wrote.Not every patient who gets an organ from a donor with a food allergy will develop the same allergy though.Some studies have found that those who receive donor livers from someone with an allergy are more likely to develop the allergy.Other studies have found that  transplant-acquired food allergies are more likely when patients are given tacrolimus, an immunosuppressive drug used to reduce the risk of rejection.The woman in this case had been on tacrolimus.Skin tests later confirmed the woman was now allergic to peanuts as well as almonds, cashews, coconuts and hazelnuts.She was given an EpiPen in case of another allergic reaction."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco anus tinned beef curry","story":"Andrew Lee parted with £. for his favourite TV dinner

before.There was the beginning of a tube then it was cut off. There was a bit of string on it too.Its weird. I dont think its fat - its super smooth. The texture is like silk.Someone said it could be a blood vessel but do they get that big Id already eaten half of my dinner before I found it and I felt sick. Itd been sat on my plate.I picked it up on the fork first and noticed the colour was dferent. It was like greyish skin coloured.You could tell it wasnt beef. Well, it could be beef, but not meat beef.Normally you dont get any kind of fat or anything. Ive never had anything odd in there before.I couldnt eat for about two days after that. Its the first diet thats worked.I normally love the beef curry with some jasmine rice and poppadoms.

It was, in fact, built  years ago to house a gentlemans fossil collection.“Of course, now it has become something of a relic itself.“Its a building that doesnt want to stand up anymore. It just wants to fall over in two big halves. Well, its going to as its owners are going to try and repair it.”Jimmy told the MailOnline: “The project was more transformative than we had originally anticipated as we had our second child during the house build. We are now a happy and growing family of four in a two-bedroom house, so it is time for us to move on to the next stage in our lives.“This is a beautul and award-winning house, ideal for a couple looking to live in a unique place that is truly inspiring.”There’s a compact kitchen on the ground floor with an octagonal living room on the first and two bedrooms on the second.It also features a terrace roof with a seating area and a staircase on the outside leading to the main entrance.The couple had originally set a budget of £, for the renovation and had to borrow £, from Jimmy’s parents to keep the work going.The family eventually moved into the property in March  after a number of delays.Annabel Dixon, of property website Zoopla, said: “This is a beautully-renovated property.

After the clock struck , the fire brigade was called for burning rubbish bins in the Etangs Noirs borough.At the spot in Rue Piers we saw a number of youths. There was quite a lot of smoke by fireworks on the streets, even though that is forbidden.Multiple rubbish bins and also a Christmas tree were on fire. There was a huge number of youths on the street, but the police were nowhere to be seen.According to Labourdette, the firefighters had to call off their mission because their safety could not be guaranteed.On their way back, their fire truck was reportedly attacked with projectiles and stones thrown by the youths.Labourdette said: At all sorts of events they [firefighters] get stones thrown towards their heads.A football match which ends thousands of kilometres away: the fire brigade is attacked with stones. A rapper who calls for a gathering in the centre of Brussels: the fire brigade is attacked with stones.

The police were present but did not intervene.Labourdette blamed the local politicians for turning Molenbeek into a no-go area, adding: Lets get rid of the political correctness which certain authorities impose on us.

About time too. But still, it’s progress.And there is no doubt that ­attitudes to women are changing.We’ve got a second female Prime ­Minister and a female playing the lead in Doctor Who.And women are rising up. We are organising, ­protesting, shaming and building power.We are making the women’s movement central to everyone’s conversation. Women are finding their voice.And the most important thing is we are getting heard.We are not going to accept mansplaining or being ­spoken down to “stupid woman”.Feminism is the word of the year, with more and more women standing up for themselves and demanding equality, and I predict that process is going to continue in .Now that I think about it, there were other good things about .It was the year we rediscovered hope in football during the World Cup.We did better than we thought we would — and it’s not often we can say that.The England team and manager Gareth Southgate restored our ­national self-esteem and gave us something to cheer about when there really was not much .The World Cup showed us nice guys can win.Sure, we didn’t bring home the trophy but it’s fair to say Gareth Southgate’s a winner in everyone’s eyes.And it’s not over yet:  is the women’s football World Cup — so that’s something to look forward to with hope.Hope is an important word. And now, more than ever, we need to find a way to hang on to the things that make us feel optimistic about the future.There were other hopeful things about .This was the year that gave us the breath of fresh air that is Meghan Markle — and it also saw the most stylish royal wedding this country has probably ever seen.Meghan was a signier of change for the Royal Family, which needed to modernise.And while I know some people have decided she is “pushy”, or criticise her for her relationship with her father, I think Meghan is one of the best things that has ever happened to our royals.We also had a royal baby — Prince Louis — and now we have another one on the way, which is happy news.My personal highlight of  was having lunch at Buckingham Palace with the Queen.It really was a wonderful occasion, spending intimate time talking to such an inspiring woman.And now here we are, poised on the brink of .I’m not a New Year’s Eve ­person. In fact, I’ll probably be having a quiet night in.I don’t do resolutions. But there are some things I’m ­looking forward to in .The thing I’m most excited about is the fact that I’m starting my new masterclass, “Get What You Want”.One of my biggest ambitions for  is to inspire women to find their ­voices, and to identy and achieve their goals.Because when women feel empowered they are more likely to get the job, pay and respect they deserve.And what could be more important than that Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its time to for us to discuss Chris Grayling. A man with the body of Donald Trump and the IQ of a roll of Sellotape, seeing him in a hi-vis jacket is as much reason to despair as spotting lumps in the groin: a sure sign that something is amiss.From Carillion to the criminal justice system, from the welfare state to the prison service, and to Gatwick Airport by way of London Bridge, theres nothing Grayling has touched and not cocked up.And now, despite a long history of incompetence and twattery, he has decided to ring in the New Year the same way he ended the last one. Doing stupid things stupidly, and spitting out another stream of sticky stuff in a vain attempt to hold all the stupid bits together long enough for something even more stupid to happen. In his two years as Minister of State at the Department for Work and Pensions he helped sacked , JobCentre staff, meaning they all had to go to, well, the JobCentre. Which was shut. When he was put in charge of the poundbn Back to Work programme getting the long-term unemployed into jobs, he was told they were genuinely sicker than expected. His response was to tighten the criteria, making their illnesses bureaucratically unnoticeable, and arguably, it must be said, making them sicker.He was called the worst Lord Chancellor since . He tried to charge defendants to plead not guilty, forcing the poor to admit crimes they may not have committed. He slashed legal aid for domestic abuse victims and banned books for prisoners. It was all deeply stupid, and very horrible. And as person in charge of the legal system, he tried to restrict the legal systems ability to scrutinise politicians. And throughout it all, he yanked a never-ending stream of sticky tape out of his mouth to bundle it all up in one big, sticky mess. As Shadow Home Secretary he was found to have used dodgy and misleading statistics on violent crime, claiming it had risen under Labour when, er, it hadnt. He claimed Moss Side was in the grip of an urban war like that of The Wire. It was left to the Manchester Evening News to point out Baltimore had  gun murders the previous year, while the Mancs suffered the grand total of zero.I pay the same train fares as you! he squeaked this time last year, failing to mention that unlike the rest of us he had a salary of pound, from the public purse, could claim his train fares on expenses, and in any case had the use of a ministerial car. All of which, you would think, would be enough to convince anyone that the best use for Chris Grayling would be as ballast in the foundations of a motorway flyover, rather than the complicated job of handing out big-money government contracts. Instead he was made Transport Secretary, a job he has truly made his own in that he has curled one out on everything thats crossed his desk.In July , now-notorious firm Carillion issued a profit warning that saw its market value drop by poundm. A week later Grayling gave it a pound.bn contract to build tunnels for HS.Grayling claimed he had secure undertakings the contract would be delivered. At the time, there was a poundm hole in Carillions books and it was  months from liquidation. Last month a drone closed Britains second-busiest airport, stranded , passengers a week before Christmas, and cost millions. CSI Gatwick was reduced to standing in fields staring at the sky, and Grayling was offered the services of a crack RAF team of specialists to find the culprit.Its been reported Grayling quibbled for  hours because his department would have to pay for it. By the time the experts were finally called, the drone and its operator had all but disappeared and the governments costs were sky-high. Now, for the second year in a row, he has marked the New Year rail fares increase by disappearing to Qatar on what is claimed to be a post-Brexit trade mission. Why he has tohaving done the same last January, and why it is always arranged during the most indefensible thing he would otherwise have to defend, is not clear. But at the same time, fairly obvious.  All of this could have been predicted some years ago,anyone had noted his , pre-politics job as business development manager for a short-lived experiment called BBC Select. It was an overnight service aimed at professionals who, it was envisioned, would record educational programmes on their VCRs .All well and good, except the business plan young Grayling was tasked with developing involved charging a subscription for it - despite the fact that the BBC, rather famously, is already paid for by everyone with a television.Unsurprisingly, BBC Select closed after  years. More astonishingly though, Grayling was elevated to the lofty position of borough councillor, MP, shadow minister, the Privy Council and then some of the most important offices in the land.  The question is not why he does the stupid things he does, but why anyone lets him play with this stuff. Either he has found something to blackmail Theresa May with, or shes using him to destroy the country so that Brexit doesnt seem so bad. But raise your head from the desk for there are two reasons to hope that the cold, stupid hands of Oh Christ Not Grayling may soon be removed from the tender neck of the British state.The first is that he has awarded a poundm contract for a vital post-Brexit shipping service to a firm that has no ships. This is standard Grayling stupidity, buta deeper scandal is uncovered he might, finally, have his ministerial career terminated. The second is that we may be getting to the end of that roll of Sellotape. Tackled about his avoidance of the train fares rise, Grayling uttered the truest words he has ever spoken: My presence in the country doesnt make any dference. Hes wrong, of course. His presence only makes things worse. Buteven HE realises hes not helping, perhaps one day soon he will do the decent thing and scuttle back to whichever village will have him."},{"url":null,"title":"corbyn rebuffs calls second brexit","story":"NewsCorbyn rebuffs calls for a second Brexit referendum by % of Labour membersLabours leader said a public vote is \"one option\" but the first thing is for Theresa May to go back to Brussels and get a better dealShareCommentsByAlain TolhurstDavid Hughes:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsLabours leader said a public vote is one option but the first thing is for Theresa May to go back to Brussels and get a better deal \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJeremy Corbyn has rebuffed calls for a second Brexit referendum after a poll suggested the vast majority of Labour members want one. The survey of , Labour members found % would like to see the party fully support a so-called Peoples Vote. Of the rest, % said Labour should not fully support a second referendum and % said they didnt know.But Mr Corbyn has long resisted such calls. Labour is keeping a referendum as an option on the table but only once other options have been exhausted. Despite the finding about a second referendum, the poll also said % of members supported the partys stance on Brexit, compared to % who oppose it.  Asked todayhe would change his stance, Mr Corbyn said: What we will do is vote against having no deal, well vote against Theresa Mays deal. And at that point she should go back to Brussels and say this is not acceptable to Britain and renegotiate a customs union, form a customs union with the European Union to secure trade. At last years Labour Party conference a motion was passed which saidanother general election is not called, then Mr Corbyn should pursue another referendum on Brexit. Speaking about the motion he told reporters the policy was sequential on a range of issues. He added: The issue of another referendum was, of course, one of the options, but that was very much after the votes have taken place in Parliament. We havent yet had a vote and I think the Government really should be ashamed of itself.  This vote has been delayed and delayed and delayed. Its finally going to take place the second week of January. That is not acceptable, this vote should have taken place more than a month ago. This Government is just trying to run down the clock and create a sense of fear between either no deal or Mays deal. Well, both of those options are completely unacceptable. Professor Tim Bale, from Queen Mary University of London, which was involved in the research, said: Our survey of Labours grassroots clearly shows that Corbyns apparent willingness to see the UK leave the EU - a stance he has recently reiterated - is seriously at odds with what the overwhelming majority of Labours members want, and it doesnt reflect the views of most Labour voters either. The work, carried out by YouGov for the Economic and Social Research Council-funded Party Members Project, also found backing for a second vote among Labour supporters, with % of current Labour voters and % of those who backed the party at the  election wanting Mr Corbyn to fully support a fresh referendum. It also suggests that tens of thousands of Labour members could be prepared to quit the party over the leaderships approach to leaving the EU.  Almost a quarterof Labour members put Mr Corbyns failure to back a second referendum down to a belief that he supports Brexit. If there is another referendum - and a three-way question - some % of Labour members said they would back Remain, % said they would leave with Theresa Mays deal, and % would support leaving with no deal. Prof Bale said: Our survey suggests Labours membership is overwhelmingly in favour of the UK remaining in the EU and badly wants a referendum to achieve that end. It also suggests that Labour voters, while not as keen as the partys members on either count, are in the same camp. Labours grassroots clearly hate Brexit and, although many of them still love Corbyn, he might not be able to rely for much longer on their support for him trumping their opposition to leaving the EU. As a result, our research is bound to increase the pressure on Labours leader to get off the fence. Labour MP Phil Wilson said: An overwhelming majority of Labours voters, as well as its members, want the public to have the final say on Brexit and to stay in the European Union. But the leadership has too often hidden behind myths that Labour is almost evenly ided on this issue when the clear evidence from this and other polls shows that it is the leadership which is increasingly out of step with its supporters.

The families were forced to give up Tax Credits and join the new system with no transition payments - risking debt and destitution. Existing benefit claimants are meant to share in a poundbn fund to stop their income suddenly dropping when they move to UC. But they dont get that helpthey have a change in circumstances, like moving house or changing working hours. Now the Department for Work and Pensionsadmits it moved , Tax Credit claimants onto UC without any transition payments between December  and November . Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood slammed the vast figure. She said: “It is unacceptable that hundreds of thousands of workers are being pushed onto Universal Credit without any protection.   Universal Credit has caused poverty and hardship to families across the country. The Government must immediately stop the roll out.” It comes a day after we reported dad Dean Lovell-Payne, , tried to kill himself while on the phone to the DWP after he waited  weeks for his first UC payment to arrive. The ex-ambulance worker - who was unable to walk and switched to UC from legacy benefits after moving house - finally received his benefits the same day.  Our figure, obtained by Labour under the Freedom of Information Act, covers people who were on Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit. That means all those affected were either in work, have a family or both. And it comes despite Tory ministers handing most existing benefit claimants extra help in a climbdown last year. Managed migration of existing claimants will now only start rolling out fully in , and those hit will get transition payments. Yet natural migration - for people whose circumstances change - is unchanged. That means million new and existing claimants will have joined UC without transition payments by December .   Citizens Advice policy chief Kayley Hignell warned the Mirror before Christmas: Were really worried about this. Its a huge amount of people going through the system. And it makes those fixes that are really fundamental around payment timeliness and the like really urgent. We are raising that repeatedly. Tory MP Heidi Allen added: I am dealing with cases where a seemingly harmless change has resulted in claimants suddenly and unpredictably being hundreds of pounds worse off each month. A DWP spokesman said: People only move onto Universal Credit from existing benefitsthey have a change in circumstances – this ensures they’re receiving the right level of support. Universal Credit is a force for good for many, and over . million people are now successfully receiving the benefit.

It was a risky move - but one that was to save countless lives. Captain Michael Lees of the Special Operations Executive and Major Roy Farran of the SAS pulled off their mission impossible, smashing through the Nazis formidable Gothic Line blocking the Allies from Italy. But Captain Lees, who masterminded the operation, was denied a Military Cross because he had disobeyed orders. Now historian Damien Lewis, whose new book tells the full story of Operation Tombola, and is demanding that Lees be posthumously awarded a medal. Here he tells Mike Lees story Once decoded in their deep mountain hideout, the radio message proved shocking and soul-destroying in equal measure: ‘Not advisable to make fur fly.’ It came from Allied headquarters, in northern Italy, where in the harsh winter of   British and American forces had fought themselves to a bloody standstill. Captain Mike Lees, agent with the Special Operations Executive– Churchill’s shadowy Ministry for Ungentlemanly Warfare – stared at the message in disbelief. A man of action who’d cut his eyeteeth on daring sabotage missions across occupied Europe, he’d parachuted behind the lines in Italy very much intending to ‘make the fur fly’. It was all too depressingly familiar. In Yugoslavia, two years earlier, he’d received similar warnings. Upon linking up with the Yugoslav guerillas, they’d given Lees the nickname ‘Mickey Mouse’, as the cartoon character was the only ‘Michael’ they had ever heard of. But Lees had gone on to earn an entirely more appropriate epithet - ‘Wild Man,’ when he’d turned a blind eye to orders from HQ, to ‘cease offensive operations with the Yugoslav resistance.’ Instead, he’d mounted a string of solo sabotage operations, ones of breathtaking daring, blowing German trains laden with war materials to smithereens.  ‘I am terribly embittered to this sort of treatment, the same thing happened in Yugoslavia …’ Lees replied, to the March  warning from Italy headquarters, complaining that it was, ‘tantamount to making a pact with the enemy.’ Left unsaid was that he planned to take little heed of such orders now. Lees had double the reasons to ignore such a directive. Renowned SAS commander Major Roy Farran, DSO MC, had parachuted in to join him, in his hideout in the Apennine Mountains, along with forty veteran fighters of the elite SAS. Finally, Lees had at his disposal the kind of men he’d long sought, to strike the target he so hungered to destroy.  That winter, the Allied advance through Europe’s southern underbelly – Operation Avalanche – had stalled in the freezing snows and on the fearsome defences of the Gothic Line, thousands of German gun-emplacements, concrete bunkers and minefields strung across the heights of the Apennines. The purpose of Lees January ’ insertion into this area had been to arm and raise a force of Italian partisans, to strike at the enemy from the rear. For weeks Lees had searched for targets, trekking through hostile territory disguised as a peasant farmer. But it was from a German deserter that he’d got his first clue as to where exactly to strike. ‘Hans’ had served with the crack German th Parachute Division, but he’d become disillusioned with the Nazi cause. He revealed to Lees that a major German Army headquarters was sited less than  hours march away. Lees needed more detailed intelligence. He ordered his ‘secret weapon’ – his Stafettas ‘messengers’ in Italian – into action. Consisting of two dozen young Italian women, the Stafettas role was to use their considerable feminine charms to extract intelligence from an unsuspecting enemy. One strikingly-beautul Stafetta succeeded in winning the affections of the senior German officer at the nearest enemy garrison, at the village of Castelnovo. From him she learned that the HQ in question was that of the German  Army, commanding , troops manning a huge swathe of the Gothic Line.  Field Marshal Kesselring himself, Hitler’s commander-in-chief, was said to frequent the HQ, from where he would place calls direct to the Fuhrer. And Kesselring’s deputy, the highly-decorated General Valentin Feuerstein - holder of the coveted Knight’s Cross of the Iron Cross - was permanently based there. Lees sensed a target like no other. If they could hit that headquarters, it could strike the knock-out blow, opening the way through the Gothic Line and saving countless Allied – and Italian – lives.  The fortress-like HQ consisted of two thick-walled buildings - Villa Rossi and Villa Calvi – flanking a road. Villa Rossi, a four-story red sandstone fortress, was the communications and planning headquarters for the entire German th Army. Villa Calvi, a slab-sided white edice, provided senior staff quarters, including that of General Feuerstein, and Field Marshal Kesselring, when visiting. If they could kill those high-ranking officers, they could decapitate the Nazi snake here in Italy. They could eviscerate the Germans’ command structure across a broad front. They could catalyze a major breakthrough of the Gothic Line, allowing Allied forces to surge north towards the prize - Berlin. Having found his target, Lees had been in dire need of elite warriors like the SAS. He’d raised a force of Italian partisans – several hundred mostly communist-leaning fighters - that were a motley crew of ‘Robin Hood ruffians.’ Indeed, the men of the combined partisan-SAS force – nicknamed the Battaglione Alleato the Allied Battalion – would speak half-a-dozen dferent languages, all told. In addition to Italian, and the German of the deserters, French, Spanish, Dutch and even Russian were spoken. The French-speakers were former members of the French Foreign Legion, who’d found their way into these hills. The Spanish-speakers were war-bitten veterans of the Spanish Civil War who’d volunteered for service in Britain’s SAS, proving themselves die-hard opponents of Nazism and earning the nickname ‘Churchill’s Spaniards.’ Then there was Fritz Snapper, a former lieutenant in the Royal Dutch Army, who had somehow wondered into these mountains he too had joined Lees motley crew. Plus their ranks had been swollen by a hundred Russians fighters, who had been captured on the Eastern Front, sent for forced-labour in Italy and subsequently escaped.  It had taken the arrival of Major Farran and his SAS, and a spectacular show of military might, to unite this force and spur it into action. Farran – always the shrewd commander and a showman by nature – had masterminded a series of massive air-drops, wherein dozens of DC cargo planes had parachuted all kinds of weaponry to the forces gathered below. Aircraft delivered US-made Willys jeeps – the SAS’s distinctive vehicles bristling with machine guns, which Farran believed ‘the greatest invention of the war’ - suspended beneath multiple parachutes. Plus there was a massive mm ‘pack’ howitzer, which would be nicknamed Molto Stanco – ‘very tired’ – by the Italians, after they had manhandled it over the hills. By such showmanship, coupled with their force of leadership, Farran and Lees honed the Allied Battalion into a -strong unit – a select band of the best of this multinational squad. Armed, trained and drilled by the SAS, Farran and Lees believed one hundred of the very finest of these warriors could sneak through terrain thick with the enemy, to strike the HQ target by utter surprise. They believed those one hundred fighters could take on the -plus German guard force manning the HQ, and win. Having worked the would-be raiders up into a frenzy of spirited self-belief, the time was ripe to strike. On  March Farran cabled a final confirmation to Italy headquarters: ‘Confirm we attack . . . First wave  British, second wave  Russians, third wave  Italians. All on foot. Plans irrevocable now.’ But just hours after setting out for the target, a runner arrived with an urgent radio message. Allied high command had seemingly got cold feet. Fearing too much ‘fur might fly’, the raid was being cancelled. Instead, Allied headquarters was considering a massive bombing raid to flatten the villa headquarters. Farran and Lees were incredulous. The Italian partisans were in no mood to delay. Their blood was up. Indeed, this would be seen as a serious breach of trust. It would alienate the partisans, and after Lees and Farran had spent so many weeks gaining their confidences.  Worse still,the mass bombing went ahead it would doubtless flatten villages surrounding the German HQ, killing hundreds of Italian civilians. ‘Collateral damage’ in the Allied planner’s view, it wouldn’t be seen that way on the ground. The partisans would be furious. Farran voiced his thoughts to Lees: they had yet to send a response, confirming that they had received the radio message. But whatthey had never received it  He and Lees decided that at the risk of a court martial or worse they would continue regardless, claiming the order to stand down had arrived too late. Come hell or high water, they were going in. There was another last-minute hitch. In the stress of the moment, Lees’ malaria, contracted during his Yugoslavia operations, had ed to haunt him. Alternatively shivering with chills, then racked by bouts of high temperature and drenching sweats, Lees refused to be left behind …  Meanwhile, at SOE headquarters, in Florence, there was utter consternation: the runner had managed to get a radio message through to them, confirming he had delivered the order to stand down. Repeated and ever more strident radio messages were sent from HQ, demanding Farran and Lees confirm the attack had been cancelled. But all they received inwas an echoing void of silence. By then, both commanders were long gone, leading the column of raiders deep into enemy-held territory. On the night of the  March the raiders reached the  Army HQ, striking by total surprise. In the intense and bloody fighting that ensued, they caused some sixty German casualties, torching the two villas and leaving them smoking, gutted ruins. The  Army HQ was eviscerated, and put out of action. Days later the Gothic Line was breached and all of Italy liberated, during fierce combat in which Farran and his Allied Battalion were to the fore. It was a signal victory in which Mike ‘Wild Man’ Lees, wounded terribly while storming the Villa Rossi HQ building, would sadly play no part. Lucky to be alive, he would be hospitalized for the remainder of the war.  Lees was written up for a Military Cross by Major Farran, at war’s end, citing the raw courage and bravery he demonstrated during the HQ assault. Sadly, this was turned down. Worse still, Lees had his war record traduced and muddied, in what amounted to a shocking betrayal. With the help and support of Lees daughter and nephew, I have started a petition to right this wartime wrong and to get Captain Lees properly honoured for his wartime exploits.

But Lorraine Hargreaves knows first hand how something so small can make such a huge dference to families that have just been given the most awful news. Lorraine, , was devastated when her youngest daughter Milly was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia, just a week after her th birthday, in November . “Nothing can prepare you for that news,” says Lorraine. “Your whole world is turned upside down.” Before this, Milly was a normal little girl who loved swimming and dancing. Now, Milly began months of gruelling chemotherapy, and also a bone marrow transplant. “She was so brave,” says Lorraine. “We’d been diagnosed at our local hospital, The Royal Blackburn Hospital, but were quickly transferred to Ward  at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital. Everything is such a whirlwind, you turn up there with nothing.” But knowing how much home comforts meant to Milly, Lorraine, who has another daughter, Hannah, , brought in her own pillow and blanket from home, a week after being admitted.   “Milly fought so hard, she always had a smile for everyone on the ward,” remembers Lorraine. But when it became clear that despite a courageous battle, Milly wouldn’t survive her cancer, Lorraine kept thinking of ways that she could help others who found themselves in the same tragic situation. Milly passed away in September , and despite her grief, Lorraine was determined to think of a way to honour her daughter’s memory, and help others. “I knew straight away what was needed. Children aren’t used to clinical white bedding, and parents spend the next few weeks on a ward with nothing but the clothes they arrive in. It was a gap that could be filled, that would make a massive dference and I wasn’t stepping on another charity’s toes” says Lorraine. She kept thinking about those first few days after Milly’s diagnosis, and that’s when she realised just how she could help. “I set up Milly’s Smiles shortly after she died, and it became a registered charity in March ,” she says. “I wanted to do something to help families in those first terrible days. So I came up with the idea of providing a welcome bag for each newly diagnosed family admitted onto Ward .” After starting fundraising, she was able to provide a sky-blue holdall with the Milly’s Smiles logo on, each containing items such as a rainbow blanket, a towel, a thermometer and toiletries amongst other items. “The blanket helps to make things less clinical, and the towel is new, so makes things just a little more comforting,” explains Lorraine, a district nurse. “We also provide a neck pillow, for the parents who spend hours sitting in a chair beside their child, and a thermal cup with a lid. I know that when you want a tea to take onto the ward, it has to have a lid. It’s these little things that make such a dference.” Since starting Milly’s Smiles, Lorraine has raised approximately pound,. Milly’s Smiles has also been chosen as a TSB Local Charity Partner by the bank’s branches in Bastwell, Blackburn, Rawtenstall, Haslingden, Nelson and Todmorden. “For such a company to support us is amazing,” says Lorraine. “Their support is invaluable.” To date, Milly’s Smiles has provided  welcome bags, “These all went to Ward , and we recently started to donate bags to Alder Hey Hospital,” she says. “Each bag costs pound, so we’re constantly fundraising. I’ve done a skye, people have run marathons for us and people who’ve received a bag have also fundraised for us, saying it was invaluable to receive one. We deliver the bags to the hospital, and the nurses then hand them out to new families. They’ve told me it makes a dficult time just a little bit easier too.” Lorraine hopes that one day, Milly’s Smiles will be beaming brightly all over the country. “I know Milly would be very proud of me,” says Lorraine. “But setting up this charity allowed me to channel my grief into something positive. Without doubt, Milly’s Smiles saved me.”For more Stories of Local Pride, click here"},{"url":null,"title":"mum shocked after spotting tooth","story":"NewsMum shocked after spotting TOOTH inside her newborn babys mouthFirdoz Zayaan, , from Leicester, couldnt believe her eyes when she saw a little pearly white poking out of baby Anias mouthShareCommentsByChris JonesHana Carter:,  JAN NewsShe has a natal tooth which is a one in , occurrence \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new mum was stunned to find her baby was born with a tiny white tooth that had come through six months early.

Even the midwives said they had never seen anything like this before.

At almost  stone and a size  she knew she must make changesshe was to wear it for her celebrations. Self-confessed carb queen Jill feared she’d never slim down as every weight-loss plan she tried restricted her beloved pasta, rice and potatoes…until she found Slimming World. Now she’s lost st and eats carbs every day! And she’s not the only one who spent years trying and failing to cut out carbs unnecessarily. New research from Slimming World and YouGov found more than a third of people who tried to lose weight have attempted to follow low-carbohydrate diets.   However people said they were dficult to follow, left them feeling hungry, bored and restricted in what they could eat. Just like Jill who, as a self-confessed carbohydrate queen, feared she had no hope of losing weight because every diet she had tried restricted the amount of carbs she could eat, making her miserable. But now Jill has lost seven stone – giving her a whole new lease of le. “I don’t know what the final straw was,” Jill says. “I’ve been big all my le. Looking back at pictures I was a chunky child. But I got to the point where I thought I am kidding myself that I am happy like this.”   By following a Slimming World Food Optimising plan, where unrefined carbs such as rice, pasta and potatoes are ‘Free Food’ , Jill is now a trim size -. “I remember shopping for holiday clothes just before I joined Slimming World and there was nothing that fitted and anything I did get just looked like a sack,” she recalls. “I was  and I thought I am not going to be like this when I am . I’d seen a dress on a website before I started losing weight that I loved, and I thoughtI ever got to a size  I would get it. So now I’ve got one – it’s a s style, fitted with a fur collar, and I love it.” For years Jill had been pretending that she was happy despite her size – even when the scales tipped st lb.  But when she finally decided to make a change she struggled to find a diet plan that would fit in with her love of carbohydrates. She explains: “I am a carb queen, every meal I have has carbs in it. I suppose it was the way I was brought up – you have carbs on your plate and everything  goes round them. “If someone said I had to cut them out I just couldn’t do it. It makes me shymiserable. I had tried losing weight with other plans and it was all weighing, measuring, counting. “Everything had a value, and I just found I had to restrict my carbs too much and I couldn’t do it.   “I got obsessed with counting, weighing everything where it got to the point it was all I could think about all day long. I used to thinkI eat that now, then I can’t eat later in the day. “I realised it just wasn’t healthy so I gave up – until I found Slimming World.” The plan was Jill’s dream because she could still enjoy her favourite foods and lose weight too. She says: “At Slimming World, carbs are unlimited. The plan is put together where you fill a third of your plate with fruits and veg or salad, then the rest of your plate is made up of Free Food which have no limit on them, and then your ‘Syns’ so you have a set number of Syns each day which are things you would expect, like fats and sugar. “But carbs are free foods – bread is restricted but you can have rice, pasta and potatoes. So that’s why it works for me because I can still eat my carbs.”   Jill swapped her usual sugary cereals and blueberry muffin breakfasts for high-fibre cereals, fruit and yoghurt – and sometimes even a healthy version of a full English.She explains: “You can have a big cooked breakfast with no guilt atall – lean bacon, poached egg and baked beans.”Instead of having a big sandwich and a packet of crisps at lunch, she now has a jacket potato topped with tuna or beans. And for dinner she still has her favourite rice and pasta dishes, but she has ditched high fat, creamy sauces for low-fat versions.  Instead of eating chocolate and crisps for snacks at work, train planner Jill now finds that she doesn’t really get peckish between meals. The mum of one from Leeds, says: “Your taste buds really do change. I’m finding with the meals I’m eating now I feel fuller for longer so I don’t really snack as much, butI do it tends to be raw veg, or Slimming World high-fibre cereal bars.” Whereas before she used to hate shopping and wore baggy clothes to hide her figure, now she loves nothing more than hitting the high street and shopping for clothes she once never dreamed she could wear. The -year-old says: “I couldn’t believe it the first time I pulled on a size  dress. For a long time I just carried on wearing the same baggy clothes I had always worn because I just couldn’t see the shydference in myself.  “When you lose that amount of weight a big shypsychological switch has to flick at some point for you to realise what you have done. For a long time when I looked in the mirror I didn’t see a dference at all – even when I had lost six stone.went on a shopping trip with a friend I had made at Slimming World and I tried on things I had never tried before – it was just an amazing feeling to be able to try on a size  dress. “Since then I’ve got into size s as well. I feel fantastic, I can walk into a shop and I can buy clothes that I like the look of. “I don’t just buy stuff because it fits, I buy stuff because I like it. “I had a photoshoot done in November which I would never have done before and I love the pictures.   “It has given me a new shyconfidence. I go running two or three times a week and I did a k in November, so losing weight has completely transformed my le. I feel like a dferent person.” And it’s not just Jill who is reaping the benefits – husband Andy, , is a fan of his we’s slimmed-down look. “My husband is loving it. He works away a lot but when he is at home he eats the same as me. He’s happy,I’m happy. I feel amazing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"norovirus reported across uk what","story":"NewsNorovirus reported across UK - what you need to know about vile stomach bugSome people left bedridden over the festive period said \"Christmas was cancelled\", with others having to ask neighbours to help them get food and medicine supplies when whole families became too ill to leave homeShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video everything-you-need-know-norovirus-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNorovirus brought misery to many over the Christmas and New Year period as some were struck down by the vile bug.

In the Royal Bolton Hospital, eight wards were closed over New Year after an outbreak of the bug - with staff urging patients families to stay away. Visiting restrictions were put in place and anyone with symptoms of norovirus were told to avoid the hospital for at least  hours after they had subsided. The bug is often called the winter vomiting bug, but you can catch norovirus all year round.The NHS advises not going to your GP, as norovirus can spread to others very easily. Call your GP or NHS you’re concerned or need any advice. The latest NHS norovirus report says: Reports of suspected and confirmed outbreaks of norovirus in hospitals in England to week , are currently at lower levels than the average number for the same period in the previous five seasons from season   to season  . Symptoms of norovirus You’re likely to have norovirusyou experience: suddenly feeling sick, projectile vomiting, watery diarrhoea. Some people also have a slight fever, headaches, painful stomach cramps and aching limbs. The symptoms appear one to two days after you become infected and typically last for up to  or  days.  What to doyou have norovirus If you experience sudden diarrhoea and vomiting, the best thing to do is to stay at home until you’re feeling better . There’s no cure for norovirus, so you have to let it run its course. You don’t usually need to get medical advice unless there’s a risk of a more serious problem. To help ease your own or your child’s symptoms: Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration . You need to drink more than usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea – as well as water, adults could also try fruit juice and soup. Avoid giving fizzy drinks or fruit juice to children as it can make their diarrhoea worse. Babies should continue to feed as usual, either with breast milk or other milk feeds. Take paracetamol for any fever or aches and pains. Get plenty of rest.  If you feel like eating, eat plain foods such as soup, rice, pasta and bread . Use special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmaciesyou have signs of dehydration, such as a dry mouth or dark urine. Adults can take antidiarrhoeal and anti-emeticmedication – these aren’t suitable for everyone though, so you should check the medicine leaflet or ask or your pharmacist or GP for advice before trying them. Babies and young children, especiallythey’re less than a year old, have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated. Norovirus can spread very easily, so you should wash your hands regularly while you’re ill and stay off work or school until at least  hours after the symptoms have cleared to reduce the risk of passing it on.  When to get medical advice You don’t normally need to see your GPyou think you or your child has norovirus, as there’s no specic treatment for it. Antibiotics won’t help because it’s caused by a virus. Visiting your GP surgery with norovirus can put others at risk, so it’s best to call your GP or NHS you’re concerned or feel you need advice. While caring for an infant or yourself get medical advice : Your baby or child has passed  or more watery stools in the past  hours, or has vomited  times or more in the past  hours Your baby or child is less responsive, feverish, or has pale or mottled skin You or your child has symptoms of severe dehydration, such as persistent dizziness, only passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all, or reduced consciousness – babies and elderly people have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated You have bloody diarrhoea Your symptoms haven’t started to improve after a few days You or your child have a serious underlying condition, such as kidney disease, and have diarrhoea and vomiting Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your stool to a laboratory to confirm whether you have norovirus or another infection.  How to stop norovirus spreading Norovirus spreads very easily in public places such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools. You can catch itsmall particles of vomit or poo from an infected person get into your mouth, such as through: close contact with someone with norovirus – they may breathe out small particles containing the virus that you could inhale touching contaminated surfaces or objects – the virus can survive outside the body for several days, eating contaminated food – this can happenan infected person doesn’t wash their hands before handling food A person with norovirus is most infectious from when their symptoms start until  hours after all their symptoms have passed, although they may also be infectious for a short time before and after this. You can get norovirus more than once because the virus is always changing, so your body is unable to build up long-term resistance to it. Stay off work or school until at least  hours after the symptoms have passed. You should also avoid visiting anyone in hospital during this time.

However Tesco have since said the anus is in fact a large blood vessel and asked Andrew tothe thing so that it can be investigated further.

Sylwia Tabor used to eat just grains and plants but is now a steak-eating carnivore after having part of her torso removed due to the deadly bug. The -year-old said she started becoming weak and struggled to digest her food while on a diet of just fruit, nuts, seeds and vegetables. She decided to become a vegan after being horried by a documentary exposing poor animal welfare in the food industry. But, after contracting the flesh-eating bug, necrotising fasciitisfrom a spider bite while camping in July , she became gravely ill.  A friend jokingly suggested a carnivore diet and, desperate to restore her strength, she went for it full throttle - eating only rare steak and offal. Speaking with extraordinary candour, health coach Sylwia, of Sacramento, Calornia, USA, said: Im grateful to the NF for making me change my diet that was killing me. Now eating roughly two pounds of either lamb or beef each day, garnishing it with nothing except a pinch of salt, she also insists her diet is ethically sound, despite having once followed the vegan principle of abstinence from eating all animal products. Hitting out at what she now calls vegan propaganda about eating meat, she said: I source my own meat from a local farmer. I know that it is coming from a good place, so the ethical concerns that I had before dont worry me any more. She continued: My sister, who is a personal trainer, says that Im mad and that I need to have other forms of nutrients and not just protein.  But she can see how much healthier I am now than I was when I used to be a vegan. Sylwia continued: After the operation and all of the antibiotics I had to take to get rid of the bug, which had eaten away from my groin to my waist, I wasnt absorbing enough nutrients because my digestive system had been wrecked from years of only eating fruit and vegetables. Then one day a friend of mine was joking and said, Maybe you should just go full carnivore, which I thought sounded like the most unhealthy thing you could do. But the more I looked into it, the more I discovered that meat eating is the most efficient way of absorbing nutrients, far more so than when you add carbohydrates and vegetables into the mix. Deciding to give it a try, Sylwia says that as soon as she ate her first piece of meat she instantly started to feel better, and was roused from the sleepwalk existence she had been in since contracting the bug which almost killed her. No longer worried by the ethical questions surrounding meat production in the USA, most of which she says is vegan propaganda, Sylwia feels healthier following her new eating regime. Sylwia, who grew up in Poland but moved to the USA with her family in , was drawn to veganism in  while a student at Triton College, Chicago, after watching Food, Inc., a documentary examining corporate farming. Profoundly affected by its unflattering portrayal of mass food production, she decided to cut meat and fish out of her diet entirely - eating only vegetables, fruit and nuts.  Very soon, however, the lack of protein in her daily diet began to take its toll on her health. I noticed that I was getting weaker, less energetic and that I was struggling to digest my food properly, recalled Sylwia. My body was clearly crying out for some protein, because I really started to crave meat, particularly around my period when I would find myself dreaming about eating raw meat. She added: If someone was preparing a juicy steak, I would have to leave the room because the urge to eat it was so overwhelming. Sylwia remained blindly loyal to her vegan principles, resisting her cravings, despite her family and friends pleading with her to reconsider after seeing how ill her clean-eating regime was making her - especially after she developed an intolerance to nuts in , her only signicant protein source. It got to a stage where I was essentially just eating fruit, as nuts and then later vegetables started giving me rashes on my skin, she said. But that made me even worse than before. The sugar in the fruit made my teeth super sensitive - to the extent where it would hurt just to drink a glass of water - and because I was getting no calcium either, my bones were very weak too. In  Sylwia, who is single, broke two ribs just moving a box, but the final straw came in , when she passed blood in her faeces.  Terried, she saw her doctor who gave her a colonoscopy - an examination of the large bowel with a camera - which although did not show anything sinister, was an indication of an unhealthy diet. From then on, I knew I had to change, because the veganism was killing me, said Sylwia. Adopting a normal, balanced diet, she could see immediately the improvement to her health and mood. As soon as I took that first mouthful of meat, I felt myself becoming stronger straight away, said Sylwia, although she found buying meat again tough and spent hours in supermarkets trying to convince herself it was OK to eat animals. While her more conventional diet meant she felt her bones becoming stronger again, her hair looking thicker and her energy restored, she was still dogged with digestive problems. Vegetables and seeds - which were for a long time my only food source, are actually antinutrients, compounds whicheaten excessively interfere with your gut absorbing what it needs, she said. And that definitely affected me in the long-run. Still, Sylwia stopped worrying about what she ate and just got on with things until a camping trip in Michigan with friends changed her le in July , after she received a poisonous bite on the ankle from a brown recluse spider, infecting her with NF. She recalled: I didnt think much of it at first. It was only a small bite on my ankle. But in late August, I developed this pimple in my groin area, which over the next days grew and grew until it was about the size of my hand.  Rushing to AE, where doctors were perplexed by the snake-like purple swelling stretching beneath the skin from her groin to her waist, she was eventually diagnosed with NF and taken straight to theatre for a three-hour operation to cut it out and prevent it from spreading further. Thankfully, the surgery was successful and Sylwia recovered well, with no need for a skin graft to replace the eaten flesh from her torso. But, in the months following her brush with death, her problematic digestive system stopped absorbing anything she ate, preventing her from eating most foods that would give her diarrhoea and rashes. Because I was on lots of antibiotics, which kills all of the good bacteria in your gut that you need to digest things, my stomach was in a mess again and I was feeling terrible, like I was during the worst times of my veganism, said Sylwia. Then, when my friend jokingly suggested the carnivore diet, after a while I actually started considering it, because by that stage I really couldnt eat much apart from meat, as it was the only thing that wouldnt pass straight through me. Surfing the web, she discovered the meat-only idea was not as hare-brained as it sounded, after seeing that several qualied nutritionists were endorsing the dietary programme. So, plumping for a new diet for a new year, in January  the former vegan resolved to became a carnivore - and has not looked back since. I just feel so much better than I ever have done, even when I was eating a normal diet, said Sylwia For the people who think it might be unusual, I would say just give it a try because it may really help you feel better in yourself.

When the couple decided it was time to cut they cake, they were horried to realise hungry guests had beaten them too it. The cake, which was made from cheese, didnt have bride and groom on the top, leading a least four of their nearest and dearest assuming it was part of the meal and tucked in. Oops. A guest said the mistake caused an absolute war to break out and said the bride was in fits of tears.   One of the guests shared the story on Mumsnet. She wrote: You wont believe what happened at a wedding last night. No, Im not the guest in question. Evening guests turned up at pm. Around pm bride and groom decided to cut the cake. Only to find cake had already been cut by a hungry guest. Cake in question was a three tiered cake made of dferent cheeses. Surrounded by grapes and crackers biscuits. No little bride and groom on top. An absolute war broke out about it. Half the people saying well, how were they supposed to know it was the cake, other half saying it was pretty obvious.

But one pub could be about to make that a thing of the past by offering up a three-course meal for just pound. Star Bar, an old-school boozer in Glasgow, is the establishment behind the ultimate bargain meal, and its very well known in the area. For a set menu, there are lots of dferent options with NINE main courses to chose between - all served with chips or boiled potatoes, peas and gravy.   So what exactly do you get for your pound  Heres the menu in full: Starter Fruit juice Soup Main Scotch pie Sausage hotpot Roast beef Smoked ham Roast turkey  Macaroni cheese Breaded fish Mince and tatties Ashet pie Dessert Rice pudding Jelly and ice creamOur colleagues at the Mirrors sister paper Glasgow Live visited the restaurant to try out the bargain offer.They had the soup to start, which they claim was the kind of soup your gran used to make, in huge vats to last a week of lunchtimes - its the Glasgow culinary equivalent of a cuddle. For mains they tried the Scotch pie, which they say was packed with flavour, and the creamy macaroni cheese.   Despite bring very full, they managed to try the rice pudding and jelly and ice cream - which were also a hit. Gillian Loney writes: I grew up in a house where never mind the quality, feel the width was the mantra for meals out - my Dad didnt do fine dining. And by that measurement alone, The Star Bar would win out as one of,not the, cheapest lunch in Glasgow. We cant very that claim, but we’re fairly certain youd struggle to find cheaper. But lets set the price tag aside for a second and consider how good a feed we had that Thursday lunchtime - not to mention the many punters in doing the same. Some of them seemed to be regulars, others were trying the bargain three courser for the first time, just like us. The service was brilliant too - each plate arriving with a smile and a cheeky wee comment that could only be made in Glasgow. You cant help but feel you’re eating a slice of city history along with your macaroni and chips - and it would be a crying shamewe lost remaining institutions like The Star Bar. Long live the pound lunch.

The anonymous woman shared photos of the two invitations on social media to express her outrage, and its caused a huge debate online, reports Mail Online. The first, more formal invitation tells guests its an envelope party, meaning guests are expected to bring a cash gt. The second is a handwritten note the woman believes is from the brides mother, detailing exactly what food each guest needs to bring - a salad and a dessert.  The note is dated September, two months before the date of the shower. Writing on an Australian Facebook group, the woman says: Potlucks are super normal in my family, especially as these invites were given at our annual potluck family reunion. Thats not the issue, but I personally dont think potlucks are a wedding bridal shower thing. To me, thats just tacky, and then to tell me and my mom what to bring as our dish  No thank you.

If I got a phone call to say that has changed I would be over the moon. But I don’t think we can sit back hoping for the phone to ring.“We have just got to be as active as we can to bring in another left-back.“Max would be my first choice to come back because he was magnicent for us. He was such a good kid to work with, but I think that ship has sailed unfortunately. Max is now trying to get himself into Derby’s team.”Left-back is unlikely to be the only position McInnes will move to strengthen this month.McInnes has admitted he would like to add “one or two” signings in the January window ahead of the second half of a campaign where Aberdeen sit just three points behind Premiership leaders Celtic and Rangers.Following the injury to Bruce Anderson in the - defeat of Livingston the Dons gaffer has admitted he could be forced to move for a striker in the window.Lowe is currently out injured having suffered a groin strain in the - defeat of Hearts. He pulled up in the Pittodrie clash and was taken off and missed games against Celticand Livingston .The injury to Lowe is a yet another blow for Derby boss Lampard, with left-back Scott Malone recently sustaining a groin injury that could rule him out for up to six weeks.Derby have not had much luck with left-backs this season as Scotland cap Craig Forsyth is recovering from knee surgery and is out for the campaign.Swedish international left-back Marcus Olsson has not played since the end of last season due to a knee injury. Olsson couldthis month, but he will need time to build match fitness and sharpness.Calum Macdonald, Derby’s left-back in the under-s, is injured.Right-back Andre Wisdom has played on the left recently.Such is the high regard Lampard holds for Lowe, who started the first two Championship games of this season, he tied him up on a new three-year contract less than  hours before he moved on loan to Aberdeen at the end of the summer window.Lampard hopes Lowe will be available within two weeks.Lampard said: “Max has a small groin injury.

Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion. She said: “We cannot afford to stand still and the board are continually looking at ways to move the school forward.

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty.

It strengthens the case, very strongly, for extending the railway to Carlisle, so I am incredibly supportive, as yoursquod expect. I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in the Borders are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

His focus, however, would be on Transport, which he regarded as his primary job.ldquoHe had made it clear that he did not intend to do anything which could be done by the [Scottish] Executive. Mr Darling saw his role not as intervening in issues which could be resolved bilaterally by the Executive with the other UK Government Departments, but rather as stepping in when asked by the Executive to do so.With an eye to public relations, Mr Darling, now Lord Darling, saidthe new arrangement saved the Executive money ldquoit would be important to do something symbolic with it.Mr Darling served as both Transport Secretary and Scottish Secretary for three years.With the SNP in power in Edinburgh and the constitution to the fore, no Scottish Secretary today would dare take such a hands-off, part-time approach to the role.In another example of the very dferent political climate in , the cabinet papers show the reluctance of Scottish ministers to legislate on same-sex civil partnerships.Rather than craft a Scots law, ministers were keen to let the UK legislate on their behalf under the Sewel convention, something the SNP regard as a constitutional problem.Indeed, the Scottish cabinet seemed reluctant to venture into the subject at all.In a September  memo, then justice minister Cathy Jamieson implied the issue was being forced on ministers and a careful media campaign was needed to avoid a row.ldquoI anticipate that the Executive will come under sustained pressure to make progress in addressing the legal rights of same-sex couples and therefore we should concede that legislation is necessary, she wrote."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-year-message-from-the-skies-to-the-world","story":"Glassrsquo concerns are inherent in the event itself, which has commissioned six writers from dferent disciplines and experiences to each pen a love letter to Europe. Each writer has then paired up with a composer and visual artist or film-maker, with the results of each collaboration projected in monumental fashion on the walls of one of half a dozen of the capitalrsquos most iconic buildings.With venues stretching from the south side of Edinburgh to Leith, and with one city centre stop requiring a walk up Calton Hill, there is considerable legwork required to complete the circuit. It shouldnrsquot be considered a race, however, and audiences are free to move between venues at their leisure, visiting each site on dferent evenings between dusk and pm to suit their schedules as desired.Unlike last yearrsquos inaugural event, when novelist Val McDermid charted the le and work of neglected nineteenth century novelist Susan Ferrier through ious Edinburgh streets, there is no continuous narrative in this yearrsquos Message from the Skies. This makes each work akin to a set of site-specic installations and environmental interventions that transform their immediate landscape.Such reimagining of the city capitalises on the recent epic-scale opening events commissioned by Edinburgh International Festival, and featuring overwhelming sound and light shows created by  Productions and projected onto the Usher Hall and Edinburgh Castle. Unlike those spectacles, words are the primary focus of this yearrsquos Message from the Skies, which looks set to be a more reflectivenot always meditative affair.ldquoItrsquos very dferent this year, explains Glass. ldquoWersquove got six very dferent writers, and each one has taken a completely dferent approach to the brief they were given, which was simply to write a love letter to Europe. I suppose thatrsquos made for more free-expression than last year, which seems only fitting just now given everything thatrsquos going on, and itrsquos been really gratying as dferent drafts have come in, and incredibly emotional as well. It really feels like this is what art should be doing right now.The writers include historian William Dalrymple, who takes an impassioned look at Scotlandrsquos relationship with mainland Europe against the backdrop of the Tron Kirk, brought to le by bespoke projection company Double Take Productions, and featuring a score from composer RJ McConnell.Bulgarian born and Highland-based non-fiction writer Kapka Kassabova will explore the origins of Europe alongside the even more dramatic Scottish Monument on Calton Hill. This will be accompanied by a score by Pippa Murphy, which is inspired by Greek, Mesopotamian and Gaelic female chanting, while images from Susannah Murphy and Cristina Spiteri of Bright Side Studios dissolve into the ether as time moves on.Leith Library is the setting for poet William Letfordrsquos touching reminiscences, with artist James Houston taking a typographical approach to illustrating the story. At Custom House, also in Leith, journalist Chitra Ramaswamyrsquos letter looks back to her childhood, holidays in Spain and le in Scotland with roots as a second-generation immigrant. Daniel Warrenrsquos accompanying film will mix archive footage and animation, and will feature a song by Emma Pollock.Up at the Cowgate, at the Bongo Club, playwright Stef Smith joins forces with composer MJ McCarthy and artist Eleanor Meredith for a moving tale of separation and broken hearts set to McCarthyrsquos ambient score and Meredithrsquos vivid watercolours. Over at the Tech Cube in Summerhall, fiction writer Louise Welsh pares things back to explore the international language of words themselves, with designer Emlyn Firth using typography to illustrate it.With a total of sixteen artists working on Message from the Skies, this multi-media fusion of form and content is itself an illustration of what might happenshared experience is used for the power of good.ldquoThe collaborations were the fun bit of it, says Glass. ldquoI spoke to each of the writers very early on, and started to try and get a feel for how they were thinking, and how they formally might approach things. Listening to that, you start to see and hear things that makes you think about what the end result might be, and to keep the authenticity of that you start to think about people from other artistic disciplines who might sit well within what each writer is doing, and you try and pair them up. People just wouldnrsquot have come into each otherrsquos spheres without this project, and you start to see and hear the words dferently.Glass doesnrsquot mention Brexit by name, but the shadow of the UKrsquos forthcoming departure from Europe looms large over Message from the Skies. Run in partnership between current Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay producers Underbelly, Edinburgh City of Literature and Edinburgh International Book Festival, and enabled by the Scottish Governmentrsquos Festivals Expo fund, the initiative also points up some of the problems which have already arisen regarding bringing artists from abroad to these shores.While the writers werenrsquot asked which way they voted regarding Brexit before they were commissioned, that should become clear from the work itself. There is little in the way of tub-thumping on display, however, with each piece humanised by the deeply personal tone of them all.ldquoDidactic is word thatrsquos been used a lot when wersquove talked about some of the big polarisations that exist when wersquore talking about Europe just now, says Glass. ldquoA lot of those conversations have been about the role of writers and artists in managing those conversations, and whatrsquos happened as wersquove gone along is that itrsquos become okay to make statements that are hard. There may be people who disagree with whatrsquos in a letter, but I think itrsquos still important to be able to make the space to have that conversation.The words written by the six writers taking part in Message from the Skies will live on regardless of what happens next, and can be published in book formdesired. The assorted artworks that bring those words to le have also been created with the same sense of love and care, and given the scale of the event, it is hoped that they too might have another le, crossing borders with their own unique sonic and visual languages as they go.ldquoWouldnrsquot it be brilliantthis could go across the world and other people could see it  Glass muses. ldquoWouldnrsquot it be wonderfulit could travel Message from the Skies, ious venues, Edinburgh, today-January , dusk-pm.www.edinburghshogmanay"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburghs-hogmanay-review-concert-in-the-gardens","story":"Concert in the GardensEdinburghrsquos HogmanayNeil Cooper****The spirit of Glasgow club-night Optimo hung over the capital on a grand scale to see out  with a very hip spring in its step.While Optimo DJs prepared to man the decks alongside Chicago House queen The Black Madonna at Leith Theatre, Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay kick-started official celebrations with a mainstage triple bill headlined by Franz Ferdinand, one of the first of a post-millennium art-pop new wave to infiltrate the mainstream.That happened shortly after the bandrsquos first scheduled Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay appearance was cancelled due to high winds.Fteen years on, the same slot is taken by Free Love, the Glasgow-based duo of Suzi Rodden and Lewis Cook formerly known as Happy Meals.The euphoric storm of hippied techno whipped up by a barefoot Rodden and a beret-clad Cook on an analogue electronic kit flanked by a mini backdrop of psychic signs and symbols suggests biblical weather wouldnrsquot be a problem.Rodden revels in conjuring electronic zaps into the air inbetween singing in French or  breaking out into Lindsay Kemp style dance routines.

Brexit is his chance to deliver on that promise and with a majority of the country now wanting to stay in the EU that leadership is needed more than ever.\"The clock is ticking and Labour must change tack in the New Year by securing a public vote on Brexit and campaigning to reflect what its members and families and communities around the UK want: to stay in the EU and rebuild Britain from within, she added.The poll, carried out by YouGov for the Economic and Social Research Council-funded Party Members Project, also found backing for a second vote among Labour supporters with  per cent of current Labour voters and  per cent of those who backed the party at the  election wanting Mr Corbyn to \"fully support\" a fresh referendum.It also suggested that tens of thousands of Labour members could be prepared to quit the party over the leaderships approach to leaving the EU.Some  per cent of Labour members put the party leaderrsquos failure to back a second referendum down to a belief that he supports Brexit.Some  per cent opposed the stance the party has taken on Brexit and  per cent of those told researchers it has caused them to consider quitting. This proportion would be equivalent to around , members, according to the projects analysis.If there were another referendum - and a three-way question - some  per cent of Labour members said they would back Remain, three per cent said they would leave with Mrs Mays deal and five per cent would support leaving with no deal.Professor Tim Bale from Queen Mary University of London, which was involved in the research, said: \"Our survey of Labours grassroots clearly shows that Corbyns apparent willingness to see the UK leave the EU - a stance he has recently reiterated - is seriously at odds with what the overwhelming majority of Labours members want and it doesnt reflect the views of most Labour voters either.\"He added: \"Labours grassroots clearly hate Brexit and, although many of them still love Corbyn, he might not be able to rely for much longer on their support for him trumping their opposition to leaving the EU.\"As a result, our research is bound to increase the pressure on Labours leader to get off the fence.\""},{"url":null,"title":"review-scottish-chamber-orchestra-usher-hall-edinburgh-four-stars","story":"Scottish Chamber OrchestraUsher Hall, EdinburghKeith Brucefour starsAS some citizens of the capital have been crossly pointing out, the history of celebrations of the turn of the year there goes back a great deal further than the time for which Hogmanay has been so successfully exploited for commercial advantage through tourism.However, it is not so very long since the Usher Hall was dark on New Yearrsquos Day because the cost of opening it then was prohibitive.Today, January the first is altogether less dour, with much of Edinburgh open for business and the SCOrsquos New Year Gala in aid of Marie Curie nurses an established,relatively recent, institution ndash and a programme the chamber orchestra takes out on the road, this year to Dumfries , Ayrand Perth .The distant model is that of the Vienna Phil at the Musikverein, whose annual concert of waltzes, marches and polkas was broadcast to the world a few hours earlier, but the SCO, happily, has more freedom of repertoire before the Strauss-soundtracked sprint to the tape of Tristch-Tratsch Polka, Blue Danube Waltz and the obligatory clap-along encore of the Radetsky March.A very full house, with a goodly number sitting in the top tier, likely included a few less experienced classical music fans, so the lack of a singer this year was perhaps regrettable, but the SCO is a band of soloists and this programme was designed to allow a number of them to show their skill.Most obviously that was leader Stephanie Gonley, stepping front of stage for the virtuoso Ravel gypsy violin showpiece Tzigane, but principal cello Philip Higham had been first in the spotlight with the opening of Weberrsquos Invitation to the Dance, as orchestrated by Hector Berlioz, and clarinettist William Stafford , and first horn Alec Frank-Gemmill were also among those featured.This was a large edition of the SCO, with percussionists, five horns, and eight brass, under the direction of Duncan Ward, a young conductor of hugely erse experience who first stepped in to work with orchestra two years ago, and who drew particularly lyrical playing from the strings here."},{"url":null,"title":"four-stars-verdict-on-edinburghs-message-from-the-skies-spectaculars","story":"Various venues, EdinburghNeil CooperFour starsHow did we allow this to happen  This is the question asked by historian William Dalrymple regarding the UKrsquos impending departure from Europe in his contribution to this six installation city-wide series of love letters to the continent which  per cent of Scotlandrsquos voters chose to remain part of.

who lives in Thurso, has been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Year honours list in recognition of his services to the community in Caithness. He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.ldquoWe had been in No.  Group Bomber Command, says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. ldquoThe whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. ldquoWe had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogetherhellip It required a lot of dferent techniques.ldquoAnd it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore yoursquod got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.ldquoThere developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.ldquoOn one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnrsquot just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.ldquoObviously we knew something was happening, Don says, ldquobecause we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werenrsquot aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. ldquoBefore that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: ldquoOne thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Donrsquos chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as ldquoPiccadilly Circus ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.ldquoWe were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place, he explains. ldquoIt was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. ldquoThey all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. ldquoHe released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one, says Don.ldquoThere was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnrsquot a great deal of resistance.It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crewmates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: ldquoThe Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.ldquoYou couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnrsquot want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  ldquoWell, everybodyrsquos scared ndash I donrsquot care what anyone says, he replies. ldquoIf yoursquore not scared you donrsquot perform, but itrsquos discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .ldquoThis is rude, I know, but itrsquos what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Itrsquos a matter of accepting whatrsquos going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job yoursquore supposed to do.ldquoItrsquos not a question of bravery. Irsquom very suspicious when people say, lsquoOh, yoursquore a brave man,rsquo or lsquoYouve got a lot of courage.rsquo You react to circumstances. Itrsquos a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.ldquoAnd I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when yoursquove got a unorm on and yoursquore acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.ldquoSo Irsquom very suspicious about lsquobraveryrsquo. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I donrsquot think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I donrsquot know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.DON can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.ldquoI fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhamrsquos Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating, Don says. ldquoHe had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a manrsquos wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.ldquoBut the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thatrsquos what I did.He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash ldquoI went to Arnhem five times during that debacle, says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until rsquo.He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann.

Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue.

People are so depressed. Folk come to the beach to get away from all those headlines about what the idiots in Westminster are up to, but it only takes one person to mention the B-word to ruin everyone rsquos bacon roll.His partner Verity, who handles publicity for the cafeacute, agrees: ldquoTo put Br**** into context, our beach is over  million years old. This does put the media hysteria into context a bit, doesnrsquot it  Itrsquos beyond stupid, whatrsquos happening down south, but the world will not stop turning, and itrsquos unlikely that any cafeacute customer is going to be in a position to influence whatever eventually happens.ldquoSo why talk about it and feel helpless and miserable  We think people need a sanctuary from it all over Christmas and New Year, and we are just the place.Posters about the cafeacutersquos lsquopolicyrsquo will be going up shortly and all lsquofinesrsquo will benefit Maggiersquos Centre Highland.The offer of respite continues daily during the school winter holidays from .am to pm, with the exception of Christmas Day.

She called for a second referendum on Scotland’s future, then backed down in the face of popular uncertainty. But to use a dferent cliché, indyref was the dog that didn’t bark in .Sturgeon can’t be blamed for the UK Government’s failure to settle the outcome of Brexit in time for the SNP leader to offer clarity on a second Scottish independence referendum – but that won’t hold for long in . She will eventually have to show her hand.When that moment comes, it will offer her the opportunity to deliver some home truths to her own supporters: that there isn’t time or means to keep Scotland in the EUthe UK leaves, and that true shape of the relationship between Brussels and London may not be known until close to the next Scottish election in .The Government in Edinburgh insists it has a mandate for a new independence referendum from this Scottish Parliament. Butthe Sturgeon believes the public will back leaving the UK over the final Brexit deal, why wouldn’t she put that to the public in  and prove it Another hold-up might not be the message independence activists want to hear, but it may be the only way to convince the majority of Scots that the question needs to be asked again.The UK Government: Get back to delivering the milkIt’s been a busy two-and-a-half years for the Blitz spirit, invoked at every opportunity by Brexit campaigners. It should mean automatic disqualication from public debate to suggest that the privations of wartime Britain are something to aspire to for the future, rather than a lesson from the past.Nonetheless, helped along by a handful of recent blockbuster Hollywood depictions, Winston Churchill has been repeatedly dragged into debate on Brexit by both sides either in support of the myth that Britain has always ‘stood alone’ in Europe, or that European unity was a Churchillian idea. In our present situation, I personally find the most useful quote attributed to Churchill his reflection that: “Democracy means when there’s a knock at the door at am, it’s probably the milkman.”The comment is obviously referring to examples of brutal oppression by the undemocratic governments of his time, but it also reflects the truth that democracy, when it s, is in part the triumph of small freedoms and practicalities over the big, dangerous idea.Events have moved at such a pace that it’s been impossible to stop and ask where we are. But however you feel about Brexit, it’s clear that a government of a wealthy country forced to nationalise shipping capacity to guarantee supplies of food and medicine, not because of a natural disaster but a political event taking place in just three months’ time, isn’t a responsible government, but one that has already failed.It serves the interests of a narrow and extreme segment of opinion to raise the stakes and turn every issue facing the West into a test of national virility. It allows representative democracies to be hijacked by debates about honouring ‘national sovereignty’ and ‘the will of the people’, asthose weren’t deeply conflicted and debatable concepts.Churchill should be invoked not just to remind us of our finest hour, but of just how banal democracy is supposed to be, when it works well.EU leaders: Tackle anti-immigration agenda head-onEurope has challenges beyond Brexit to face in , and the continent will have to find its way without the certainty of Angela Merkel’s leadership.She offered the strongest, most consistent defence of European values in response to the wave of refugees from conflicts across the Middle East and Africa. Someone  will need to step into her shoes and ensure the anti-immigration narrative doesn’t metastasise into a yellow-vested popular movement that could disrupt upcoming national and EU Parliament elections.US Democrats: Remember who your enemy isIt seems crazy that, with the US Presidential election still almost two years away,  will be decisive in whittling down the field of candidates seeking to oust Donald Trump from the White House.The Democrats would do well to ensure that the process doesn’t turn into a bloodletting. The signs aren’t good, with backers of  left-wing challenger Bernie Sanders and  breakthrough candidate Beto O’Rourke tearing chunks out of each other on social media.Yes, the party needs to refresh its identity to try win back the voters that helped deliver Trump the presidency.But Democrats also need their whole coalition to back the candidate they eventually settle on – something they didn’t achieve in .So much of the political narrative across the West relies on the outcome of the  presidential election. Perhaps more than in any US vote in history, the eyes of the world will be on the Democratic Party. They need to get it right.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4850831.1546358824!/image/image.jpg","title":"rail fare rise paying more for poor service leader comment","story":"Rail fares have soared in recent years and commuters may respond by taking to the roads, causing increased congestion and air pollution.There is something rather romantic about travelling by train. So much so that VisitScotland promotes “Scotland’s Great Rail Journeys” through some of this country’s most stunning scenery such as the West Highland Line from Glasgow to Mallaig and the trip from Inverness to Kyle of Lochalsh. This is rail transport at its finest, travel for its own sake, for enjoyment.But the ordinary experience of many Scottish commuters attempting to travel on more workaday routes is anything but joyful.Instead, delays and cancellations have become all-too-common – with ScotRail’s current problems recently branded “unacceptable” by Transport Secretary Michael Matheson in the Scottish Parliament. Those failings can have signicant knock-on effects on iniduals and the wider Scottish economy. Indeed, one Edinburgh shop boss last month went so far as to say he would never again employ someone who relied on trains to get to work because of the delays experienced by a key member of staff. That may have been an over-reaction, but the frustrations of those concerned are understandable to most people.: Alastair Dalton: How to find hidden cheaper rail faresAnd so it was hardly surprising when there was a chorus of outrage over the latest ticket price rises. ScotRail’s fares were due to go up today by an average of . per cent, while London North Eastern Railway’s fares were to increase by . per cent. Across the whole of the UK, the average rise is . per cent.An analysis of more than  routes by Labour found the average annual season ticket cost £,, up £ from , and that fares had risen nearly three times faster than wages.With UK rail travel already among the most expensive in Europe, commuters can be forgiven for complaining, particularly when the service is not up to scratch. Apart from delays, finding a seat on the most popular rush-hour journeys is often a struggle.The problem for those who travel by other means is that rail travellers may do more than complain, they could decide to switch to the roads, leading to increased congestion, air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.The railways are a vital part of this country’s transport infrastructure, playing a key role in the economy. Trains need to run on time except in the most exceptional circumstances.

Now senior party figures want her to make the same call on tuition fees, the Tory source said.“Ahead of the last election, we made the announcement on free prescriptions,” the source said. “The other big policy is tuition fees.“When voters decide on a change of government, it hasn’t been because the winners have offered total, radical change, but because they’ve represented a degree of continuity like Tony Blair in .”The source added: “There’s the issue of unfairness, with many young people not able to get a university place because of free tuition. People are waking up to that, but it doesn’t look like a decisive sht will happen by .”The SNP’s defining policy of not charging tuition fees for undergraduate courses remains popular. A poll ahead of the  Holyrood election found voters gave it a rating of . out of ten, behind only pledging to increase funding for the NHS.However, critics say it has failed to improve access to higher education for all. The participation rate on degree-level courses for -year-olds from the most deprived areas was twice as high in England in  as it was in Scotland.And opponents claim there is growing evidence that a cap on university places for Scottish and EU students means pupils with top marks are being unfairly shut out.Figures for  show , Scots failed to get a place at a Scottish university, equivalent to three in ten applicants. The figure is  per cent higher than when tuition fees were abolished.Responding to the figures yesterday, Tory education spokeswoman Liz Smith said: “The fundamental problem of the SNP’s free tuition remains the fact that there is discrimination within the system and an unfair capping system, which means that a ­signicant number of extremely well-qualied, Scots-domiciled students are unable to get a place.”Brexit could allow future Scottish Governments to end free tuition for the more than , EU students accepted at Scottish universities each year, easing that pressure.A policy review is being carried out by Tory MSP Donald Cameron to prepare a manesto for  that can put Ms Davidson into Bute House. However, the source told The Scotsman that university tuition policy was unlikely to change while Ms Smith remains in place, as she is considered a strong supporter of the principle of fees.An SNP spokesman said: “Just like on prescription charges, the Tories have railed against SNP policy for years, but now seem to be realising that their plan to whack a price tag on education is deeply unpopular.“The SNP scrapped tuition fees – in contrast with the Tories’ record in England where young people face tuition fees of £, a year.”A Scottish Conservative spokesman said: “As with every party, we are undertaking a policy review and we will set out our proposals in the run-up to the  Holyrood election.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4851099.1546441676!/image/image.jpg","title":"parts of berlin wall to be auctioned as part of 30th anniversary","story":"Sections of the Berlin Wall will be auctioned as the th anniversary of the day it fell approaches.Symbolising the end of the Cold War and the re-unication of Germany after border controls between east and west of the country were lted on November  , parts of the historic masonry could fetch up to £, when they go under the hammer in West Sussex in March.The wall was built in sections which were each . metres tall and . metres wide.Six complete sections will be available to buy in two lots at Summers Place Auctions in Billingshurst.They feature messages painted by the German artist and environmental activist Ben Wagin in  after visitors chipped off the original graffiti, the auction house said.Since then, the blocks have been part of a memorial garden called the Parliament of Trees which stood in Berlin opposite the Reichstag parliament building to honour the lives of the  people killed at the wall trying to escape to freedom.Parts of the commemorative structure had to be removed to make room for one of the city’s new parliamentary buildings, the Marie-Elisabeth Luders Haus, and now these sections are for sale.The larger lot - made up of four sections and expected to sell for between £, and £, - is inscribed with a quote from the then-German president Richard von Weizsacker, which is translated as: “To unite means to learn to share”.On the other side of the stone is graffiti which reads “Berlin November ”.The smaller lot of two sections could fetch between £, and £, and includes a phrase translated as “Earth will become earth”.Auctioneer James Rylands said: “This is such a historic offering.“These parts of the wall were safely preserved since , and the two complete wall sections are now available for sale and would look great in a public garden or museum, as well as in a private home.“It is a great architectural and artistic statement, but also a symbol of the triumph of freedom over tyranny.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"vandalism incident takes place in sumburgh airport car park ","story":"Police are appealing for information after three cars had their windows smashed at Sumburgh Airport.Each of the vehicles, which were parked in the main car park, had their door windows smashed.The incident is believed to have happened between pm on Monday and am on Wednesday.Police are asking anyone with information to contact , or attend Lerwick Police Station..."},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland. was a milestone in a changing Ireland. It was given voice in the Repeal referendum. In Belfast the largest political demonstration was Pride. For this generation the border is an anachronism. When the Repeal result was read out a sign was held aloft, ‘The North is next’. Rights transcend borders and so does this generation. will mark the centenary of the First Dáil. A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8745017.1545218388!/image/image.jpg","title":"double celebrations for stuffabusni toy collection","story":"Thanks to the generosity of the Northern Ireland public, thousands of children living in poverty across the province will receive presents this Christmas.For the second year in a row, Translink and U joined forces for the Stuff a Bus Toy Appeal, in aid of The Salvation Army and St Vincent de Paul.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build.

A memo written by an Irish Government official following a debate in the House of Commons about the murders said that Mr Kilfedder raised the possibility of a Church excommunication of IRA terrorists, which \"might in consequence reduce their funerals to very modest affairs\".Moments before the two corporals were dragged from their car Wood drew his pistol and fired a warning into the air, but it did not deter the crowd from surrounding the vehicle.

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture The diplomat said many MPs who did not take an active interest in Irish affairs became \"puffed with outrage and conviction\" about doing something in response to the killings.He said suggestions ranged from demands for a tougher and revised policy of policing funerals to a demand for internment throughout Ireland and, in \"more cases than previously\", to a demand to setting a date for withdrawal from Ireland \"in order to let the Irish get on with butchering each other\". State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary Mr Ryan also said people across Britain wrote to their MPs demanding greater action against terrorists.The two plain-clothed British soldiers inadvertently drove into the path of the funeral before mourners pulled them from the car and were beaten before being shot dead by members of the IRA.The murders happened days after the funerals of the three IRA members who were shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. State papers: Taoiseach backs Garda in face of Iron Lady Margaret Thatchers disdain Mr Ryan said after meeting backbenchers at Westminster, he was struck by their exasperation and anger \"without any proper sense of how to ventilate it\" while there was a resurgence of \"frustrated patience\" with Ireland.\"The complexity of the issues elude their instinctual approach to policy questions, that of self-interested pragmatism and this further fuels their primary response to events such as last Saturdays,\" he added. State papers: Thatcher warned Haughey of worst civil war everUK allowed Irish unity \"It has to be said that no amount of violence toward the UDR, the RUC and Northern Irish or Irish civilians of any religious persuasion could come anywhere near provoking the same reaction in Britain to Saturdays killings - and the sort of killings they were - of their own English soldiers.\"He later said there was a risk the Anglo-Irish relationship and the Agreement may be \"caught in the net\" when MPs look for the reasons behind the murders.Days after the killings, the Secretary of State Tom King, made a speech to the House of Commons in which he described the \"horric events\" that shocked the world. State papers: Thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in Guildford Four case  In a separate memo from Mr Ryan following a meeting with Conservative MP Edward Leigh, he said the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was left \"very distressed and very angry\" by the soldiers murders.Mr Leigh indicated that MPs held special meetings to call for support for \"much tougher and direct action\" by the SAS and other special units against terrorists.\"He stressed several times that he was not exaggerating the mood generally\", Mr Ryan wrote.Mr King told Mr Leigh during a meeting they had reason to believe the IRA was \"planning a serious offensive\", however he did not elaborate further than this."},{"url":null,"title":"ben simmons rounds off 76ers win with the cheekiest of plays from","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

save twin babies lives","story":"Two little Derry twins have delivered an early Christmas present for the nurses who helped to save their lives.Saorlaith and Saoirse McLaughlin spent the first few weeks of their lives at Altnagelvin Hospital’s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit .The girls were born six weeks prematurely and suffering from a potentially fatal complication called \"Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome,\" where one baby gets the majority of the blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.Their parents, Bob and Michelle, have since raised a staggering £, for the unit, with the help of their friends and work colleagues.This year alone, they raised over £, through a tattoo fun day and a sponsored walk.But the McLaughlin’s decided that as well as vital equipment for the ward they wanted some of the money to be spent on the nurses, who work so tirelessly for the tiny babies in their care.“This year we wanted to put a bit of focus on the nurses and let them know we appreciate everything they do for sick new borns in Derry and beyond and especially our own twin girls,” explained Bob.“We asked the nurses to give us a list of stuff they needed for their tea room and of course we added a few extras and we are also going to buy them a new three seater sofa.“We felt it was very important that the nurses should have everything they need to make decent food.“It’s not a lot but it will make a dference to them.”“We want them to know that people are thinking of them and appreciate what they do.“The NHS canteen is closed when they are on night sht and at the minute I think all they have is a kettle and a toaster.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

babies in their care.”The couple gave the nurses a voucher for a fridge freezer, cups, plates, cutlery, glasses a George Foreman grill, a set of knives, a radio and a £ MS voucher.And next month, they will present a cheque for the remaining £, to be spent on frontline services at the unit.“It was fantastic to catch up with some of the lovely nurses who did so much for our girls Cathy McClafferty Bridgeen Devine and Ciara Doherty and they passed on their thanks for the generosity of the public“We’d like to give a big thank you to everyone who made this possible including Michael Kelly who held a fundraiser at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park in the twins’ honour.”The tattoo fun day and last weekend’s sponsored walk have raised over £,, which will be donated to the unit next month.Mr McLaughlin says his employers and colleagues at First Source have played a huge part in helping them raise the £, over the past three years.“The management have been so supportive,” he continued.“They pick their own charity every year, but they also help a lot of smaller charities and a lot of it goes under the radar because they don’t advertise it.“When I brought my sponsorship form for the walk into work I raised £, in just five hours.“That’s how generous people in First Source are, there were people donating £ and £.”Picture Saorlaith and Saoirse

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park. The closing date for applications is the end of next month.Since the s, the forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, a long line of passionate gardeners who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important  hectare arboretum.The pound, Heritage Lottery Fundgrant will be used to help fund the development phase of the project, which will work to achieve a vision for Castlewellan Historic Demesne to create a heritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.The development phase includes surveys of the woody plants in the arboretum and bioersity of the park, alongside design work to repair and develop the buildings in The Grange and walled garden. Work is also required to carry out further consultations and submit planning applications.Council chairman Mark Murnin, thanked the HLF for its financial support for the exciting project.ldquoThe park is such a vital part of the local community, he said. I am delighted that this funding gives us the potential for its restoration and that future generations will also be able to enjoy the facility and engage with its heritage, he added.The local authority is keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the Walled Garden area designed to provide access via lt to its upper floor, with the local council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.Politicians were told last week that architects have been awarded the tender for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard and Rhododendron Wood areas, with work underway on planning and statutory approvals for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard.It has also been confirmed that a topographical survey mdash which could cost as much as pound, mdashwill be required to assist with the planning process.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.It is envisaged that initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the critically acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood.A critical look has also been taken of the parkrsquos traffic management and parking facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£700k environment scheme set to begin  ","story":"WORK on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick starts on January .The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the initiative which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the scheme to facilitate the contractor.The government department is making a pound, contribution to the public realm project, with the local authority providing the remainder of the cash for the eagerly-awaited revamp.Design proposals have revealed the work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year.The government department said funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.Local council officials are delighted to be working in partnership with the Department for Communities to deliver the project and are looking forward to the benefits that it will bring to Irish Street in terms of regenerating a central part of the town which has missed out on major public sector investment for several decades.Damian Mulholland mdash director of regional development with the Department for Communities mdash said recently that funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.He said the latest investment for Irish Street will enhance the natural heritage of the area at this historic part of the town and help improve visitors and resident experience.Councillor Dermot Curran says he is pleased work will start early in the New Year and has appealed to motorists to be patient during the lane closure.ldquoI realise this will inevitably have an impact on traffic, but hope roads officials will alter the sequencing of town centre traffic lights in a bid to minimise this, he continued. ldquoI hope the lane closure will be in place for the shortest time possible and will be liaising with contractors throughout the duration of the scheme.Cllr Curran said the scheme will help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents and help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment.He continued: ldquoBusiness owners in particular will be delighted that work is due to start soon. As I have said previously, Irish Street is ripe for redevelopment opportunities and this major investment is long overdue.Cllr Curran is also hopeful that Newry, Mourne and Down Council will make a fresh bid for Heritage Lottery Funding to help restore historic buildings within Downpatrickrsquos conservation area, which includes Irish Street.Several weeks ago it was confirmed that the local authorityrsquos initial bid for a so-called townscape initiative had been rejected, despite a signicant amount of time, effort and money being invested in the application process.Officials in charge of the heritage fund claimed the local authorityrsquos bid was influenced by planned regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area ldquorather than heritage need.In addition, they argued there was limited scope within Downpatrickrsquos townscape initiative area to deliver a ldquocomprehensive scheme and believed that given development proposals for Irish Street and the townrsquos former police base, the local authorityrsquos proposed scheme was ldquoinfluenced by regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area.Cllr Curran says he hopes a fresh application will meet with success to assist further the social and economic regeneration of not only Irish Street, but the wider town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch fete Schmidt  ","story":"IRELAND coach Joe Schmidt was the guest of honour at Ballymacarn Park on Friday when  members and guests enjoyed an excellent lunch followed by a question and answer session, conducted by club chairman Philip Gregg.He was his usual humble self as he described his coaching philosophy and the journey he has been on over the past  years and it was a wonderful afternoon for all in attendance.Despite his tight time schedule, Joe took the time to mingle with those present and was a complete gentleman throughout.

It has also a topic of considerable concern and a high profile environmental issue.Members of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee were told on Monday night that flytipping places a ldquosignicant demand on the organisationrsquos budget with staff also erted away from other duties to deal with the problem.Council officials are currently working alongside Environment Agency staff and neighbouring local authorities in what is being described as an attempt to ldquoadopt compatible practices and approaches to highlight the issue and reduce the scale of the problem.If the amount of the waste dumped mdash mostly in secluded areas mdash is greater than two cubic metres, or is hazardous, the incident is reported to the government agency. Council enforcement officers will also investigate each incident and assessthe culprits can be identied and prosecuted.On Monday night, councillors were told that over the past eight months there have been almost  reported fly tipping incidents across the district.Council staff responded to  incidents, with contractors removing waste on  occasions. Environment Agency staff removed waste on  occasions.While the cost of removing waste over the past eight months is estimated at almost pound,, council officials have suggested the yearly total could top the pound, mark.The cost of flytipping on hard pressed ratepayers comes just a few weeks after council officials were asked to look at innovative ways of combating the problem.Councillors are concerned about the scale of the issue and the restrictions being placed on what material ratepayers can dump at household recycling centres.Some elected representatives have suggested council officials should reintroduce a service used by the former Down Council which arranged for a local authority bin lorry to visit some towns and villages on a Saturday morning to allow people to get rid of their household waste.The scheme proved extremely popular and while it was in service there were few reported flytipping incidents in the area.In addition, community groups helped keep their respective towns and villages clean by taking part in litter picks, with their efforts recognised by the local authority via an awards scheme.Councillors also believe the fact that some of the districtrsquos household recycling centres do not accept certain types of waste is contributing to the scale of the flytipping issue which, they say, must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 19%2C 1978  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash Fears that Newcastlersquos status as a leboat base could be thrown on the rocks were sunk yesterday by the Royal National Leboat Institutionrsquos chief spokesman in Ireland, Lt-Col Brian Clark.In a clear-cut statement he dashed the hopes of  Kilkeel fishermen who have called for a full-scale rescue centre to be set up in their port instead of Newcastle.Lt-Col Clark, who is the RNLIrsquos organising secretary for all of Ireland, has also hit out strongly at claims that the prospect of a tug-orsquo-war situation is looming between Newcastle and Kilkeel.He said: ldquoKilkeel has indeed been considered carefully as a possible location for a leboat, but the major requirement is that a boat must be able to get away from its base promptly in all kinds of weather.ldquoThe RNLI management committee feels that this capability is at present lacking in the case of Kilkeel where strong winds create unfavourable conditions at the entrance to the new harbour. These conditions could prevent a leboat from ing to its moorings and may prevent it from getting out of the harbour on service.Lord Roden, the honorary secretary of the Newcastle leboat station, has also rejected the latest call to switch the leboat base from his town to Kilkeel.ldquoI can give an assurance that Newcastle is taking no part in such an argument, he said. ldquoThe stationing of boats on the coast is solely a matter for the RNLI management committee.ldquoThe Newcastle leboatmen are proud of their boat. They have been operating here since , butany change in the situation was introduced I think they would accept it.DRUMANESS mdash Teddy, the big-hearted golden labrador from Drumaness, who made a habit of carrying his masterrsquos schoolbag home from school each day, is missing. Owner, Patsy Tweedie, of Mullamore Drive, thinks he is dead.Teddy, who featured on the Recorderrsquos front page in February, hasnrsquot been around his home for over two weeks and this makes Mr Tweedie almost certain he is dead.ldquoTeddy had been running around with a bitch recently and came him peppered with pellets just before he disappeared, Mr Tweedie said. ldquoThat makes me believe he has been shot by some farmer who thought he was worrying sheep.ldquoIf that is the case I feel the farmer has made a mistake. Teddy wouldnrsquot worry sheep. He was far more interested in carrying my sonrsquos bag home from school and things like that. He was well known in the village and senior citizens were often thankful to have him around as a sort of watch dog.Mr Tweedie said there had been several cases of sheep worrying in the district recently and thatrsquos what led him to believe that a farmer may have shot him.He added: ldquoWe certainly miss him. One way or another, I would be interested to hear from anyone who saw him recently.KILLYLEAGH mdash Mr David Watson thought he had fought his last battle with the end of World War  mdash but he was wrong. Mr Watson, who is  and probably one of Killyleaghrsquos oldest residents, has been fighting a gruelling battle with the Housing Executive to obtain a house without stairs.At his Comber Road home Mr Watson and his  year-old we, Liza-Jane, have been tormented for a long time by problems which are easily overcome by the young, but cause massive complications for older citizens.The normally simple operation of climbing stairs is is a great task for Mrs Watson. Because of ill health, she has to crawl up to her bedroom on hands and knees and get back down on hands and knees.Spearheading the Watsonsrsquo case has been their daughter, Mrs Jean Cheevers, and after a long struggle she has finally managed to get good news for her parents.After bringing her case to the attention of the local MP, Mr Enoch Powell, Mr Gerry Fitt MP, Cllr Rowan-Hamilton, the Sunday News and the Down Recorder, she has at last evoked a reaction from the Housing Executive.The Executive has now decided to take a ldquohumanitarian attitude to the couplersquos case, therefore increasing their chances of getting a stair-free home.In a sympathetic letter to Mrs Cheevers, an Executive spokesman explained that full consideration had been given to the age and state of health of Mr and Mrs Watson.ldquoI should add that our ability to rehouse your parents in accommodation suitable to their needs will be dependent on such accommodation becoming available in the area, the spokesman added.DOWNPATRICK mdash A bumper medieval pageant proposed for Downpatrick in May to celebrate St Patrick is hanging in the balance mdash and only a large turnout at a public meeting early in the New Year can save it from the chop.The pageant, the brainchild of Down Councilrsquos arts committee, is seen to be one of the best ideas to come out of the district for some time mdash but unless sufficient backing is forthcoming, then the community festival will have to be scrubbed.Organisers have been guaranteed funds from Down Council, but in order to quality for a big payout by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board will have to have the potential to be a major tourist attraction and to be continued each year.Mr Frank Connolly, a spokesman for the arts committee told the Recorder: ldquoIf there is no support, there will be no festival, itrsquos as simple as that. Wersquore calling a public meeting for January  in the new library in Downpatrick and itrsquos essential that there is a massive turnout of interested people and of organisations who are willing to play a part.ldquoA successful event would no doubt help tourism and itrsquos in the interest of the district to give it their full support.BALLYGOWAN mdash A young handicapped Ballygowan boy received an extra Christmas surprise recently when his pet donkey gave birth to a baby foal.Seven year-old Gregory Townley suffers from spina bida but the new addition to the family is certain to add an extra sparkle to Christmas for him.His mother, Mrs Myrtle Townley, said: ldquoMy husband got a donkey for Gregory two years ago after he bought a motorbike for my nine year-old son Roy. The little foal was born two weeks ago and Gregory will now have twice as much to handle.ldquoHe has still not picked a proper name for the new addition.

Behind-the-scenes discussions are tang place in an attempt to end the monopoly of harbour facilities by the Strangford ferry and open up berths for smaller craft.Strangford, as a port of call for small boats, was virtually closed off several years ago with the expansion of the ferry service and ancillary facilities.The villagersquos past has always been linked with the harbour when an armada of small boats tied up at the harbour wall, particularly during the successful carnival days.DRUMNAQUOILE mdash Police are investigating the slaughter of three sheep and the injuring of ten others in the Drumnaquoile area.

I don’t think anyone should be afraid of it.”Mr McCarthy, who sat on the SDLP national executive for  years, said the party had been in decline for well over a decade. An SDLP source told the News Letter that, having spoken to councillors in the party theand breadth of the Province, he was convinced that the “vast majority are ready and willing to embrace” the proposed merger.The News Letter contacted a number of SDLP members yesterday in a bid to gauge opinion on the matter.Robin Swann: With Stormont still out of action, people’s faith in politicians is stretched to the limit Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Of the more than  people we contacted by phone, only three answered, and none were willing to comment.MLA’s Patsy McGlone and Daniel McCrossan both said it was an “internal party matter”, while former SDLP deputy leader Seamus Mallon said he had “no information on the subject whatsoever”.In his New Year’s message, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has said the party is ready to “embrace” change in .try catch            ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

By hanging on as she did and with the support of everyone involved the rescue was affected quickly and safely.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

According to the latest Real Estate Outlook report from CBRE, there was take-up of , sq ft of office space across  transactions, in . It says that was more than double the figure a year earlier. Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
