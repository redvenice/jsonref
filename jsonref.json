[{"url":null,"title":"Inside Brad Pitt Michael Douglas Boris Beckers run Majorcan holiday homes","story":"Share this article   Meanwhile, Michael Douglas has been trying to sell his sprawling 190-acre estate called S’Estaca, in Valldemossa, for the last five years, reducing it from €50 million (£42.2m) to €26 million (£22m). In October 2018 the actor took his home off the market, but in June this year it was reported that the estate was back up for sale at the lower price of €26m (£22m) and he even released a video of the home. The Hollywood star narrates over spectacular drone footage on his S’Estaca estate, reports Homes And Property.But what the video didn’t show was the mansion\u0027s rubbish-strewn gardens and it’s thought that he and wife Catherine Zeta-Jones haven’t set foot on the property for years.He bought the stunning 250-acre property in Majorca with his then wife Diandra Luker in 1989 for just $3.5 million (£2.9m). Even after they split up eleven years later, they have shared the property for six months each of the year.           Michael Douglas\u0027 home has also been left in a state of disrepair with the star having tried to sell it for five years, most recently dropping the price to €26 million (He is pictured with wife Catherine Zeta-Jones in Majorca in 2010)         Building materials such as bricks are seen on the Douglas\u0027 estate as well as a black bin lid sitting int the middle of the space         A fence around the home looks faded and slightly unstable as it bends back towards the Douglas holiday homeThe estate has been left looking rather unkempt since it was placed on the market, with yellow grass covering much of the land and rubbish piled up in some spots. The shutters on the windows are also firmly closed and neighbours on the white isle say they haven’t seen the residents for months and only on the odd occasion in the last decade.Broken tiles and bricks have also been left on the grounds and old wood fires haven’t been cleared away, but despite this the home\u0027s exterior paint still appears to be in good condition.In the past, the stunning Spanish retreat has played host to the likes of Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Michelle Pfeiffer and Jack Nicholson.The property boasts two cottages, five apartments, 10 bedrooms in total, 11 bathrooms, home theater, outdoor heated pool, library, games room, outdoor kitchen, wine cellar and vineyard.

The Welsh beauty has almost never been seen at the house since they tied the knot in 2000.The Hollywood power couple own over $100 million (£84.9m) in real estate all over the world, and the Welsh-born Oscar winner admits: \u0027Like people collect art, we collect homes.

The agency also claims it did not receive any money for Redknapp\u0027s partnership with furniture retailer Harveys (pictured) The former Strictly Come Dancing star, 44, was fined £666 and handed three points after admitting running the light in her £31,000 Land Rover.She was caught by a speed camera going through the light 1.4 seconds after it turned red.Through her lawyer, the mother-of-two told of the strain of her orce from football pundit husband Jamie Redknapp at Lavender Hill Magistrates\u0027 Court.She admitted jumping a red light in her two litre diesel Evoque in the A3205 near Wandsworth bridge in south west London, at around 9.34am on November 2.A spokesman for InterTalent told Mail Online: \u0027Louise Redknapp was contracted as a client to InterTalent for two years until 2018.

The Elusive drew admiring glances, her new owner wrote in his log, but he was embarrassed to show fellow mariners the state of the vessel inside\u0027On the first day of her maiden voyage, the mast collar began to leak and on 15 January the forward cabin was flooded with water because of an unfinished cable penetration in the watertight bulkhead,\u0027 explained Mr Justice Teare.Over the next few months, a range of further problems emerged, lawyers said, including a sail block \u0027disintegrating\u0027 and the davit arm - a crane-like structure used for lowering the yacht\u0027s lifeboat - coming loose, leaving the dingy dragging in the water behind the yacht.On January 18, Elusive berthed in La Coruna, Spain, for repairs, but the mast continued to leak and the professional skipper who was helping Mr France find his feet reported: \u0027Crew morale is extremely low.\u0027On January 29, she set sail for the Caribbean on the Atlantic leg of her world cruise, but was forced to retreat to the Canary Islands when her generator packed in.The skipper reported: \u0027We are suffering problems never experienced before and the general feeling is that the boat is not fit.\u0027Other problems included the navigation equipment playing up and the autopilot temporarily \u0027shutting down\u0027.Mr France reported that Elusive was attracting \u0027admiring glances\u0027 from fellow sailors due to her appearance, but complained: \u0027I am embarrassed to show them the state of the boat, with blue tape holding drawers and cupboards shut, towels to catch water leaks, badly stained furniture and stink of diesel in the saloon.\u0027But by May 2017, Elusive had reached Antigua, where he claimed Discovery Yachts Group personnel effected superficial repairs after he sent out a list highlighting the defects.The same month, he sent a \u0027message of complaint\u0027 to Discovery Yachts Group, which read: \u0027Surely this is not the standard of build quality one should expect when spending £1.5m.         The couple jokingly renamed their new 58-foot-long sailing boat the \u0027HMS Disappointment\u0027 \u0027At this time the boat is not fit to sail, and certainly not fit for an ocean passage. I have no confidence in the boat.\u0027By August 2017, Maria was adding to the litany of complaints, emailing about things \u0027which drove her crazy on this beautiful-to-be boat\u0027, while Mr France referred to it as \u0027HMS Disappointment\u0027 in a later message.Elusive\u0027s next port of call was Annapolis, where Discovery Yachts Group carried out further repairs on the boat in September 2017, but Mr France and his wife were \u0027underwhelmed by the work\u0027.He said he even agreed to let Discovery Yachts Group exhibit Elusive at the October 2017 Annapolis Boat Show if they overhauled her with full repairs.And Mr Justice Teare today backed Mr France\u0027s claim, ruling: \u0027It is plain that an agreement had been reached whereby in return for the yacht being exhibited at the Boat Show the outstanding items of repair would be carried out.\u0027Mr France\u0027s legal team said Elusive remains vulnerable in the high seas and is \u0027not watertight\u0027, although capable of tackling calm waters.Maritime experts highlighted defects such as leaking deck hatches, a lack of accuracy in fuel and water gauges, and problems with the battery supply.Failure of catches on cupboards and drawers and a fault in the navigational instruments also rendered Elusive unsuitable for blue-water cruising, Mr Casey said.Part of the underlying problem is that \u0027there are a number of areas where the end grain of woodwork has not been sealed\u0027, he added.\u0027Central to his case is an assertion that the yacht is not watertight,\u0027 he explained.\u0027It became clear that the yacht had not been properly outfitted.\u0027She was not - and is not now - suitable for her agreed purpose: blue-water cruising.\u0027He added: \u0027These were serious and frightening problems, and symptomatic of a vessel that had not been properly outfitted and was not ready to go to sea.\u0027The yacht, which should have become the couple\u0027s permanent base, is now beached on a stand near Lymington awaiting an overhaul, while Mr France and his wife are in rented accommodation.Neither company was represented in court, but in their defence partly blamed Mr France for the yacht\u0027s troubles, while Discovery Yachts Group also maintained it had no contractual relationship with Mr France or his company.It was under no obligation to put right any defects in the yacht, but had made \u0027extra efforts\u0027 to assist him by doing repairs, the company claimed.But Mr France insisted he was no novice, having clocked up many years of maritime experience.After ruling against both companies, Mr Justice Teare made clear Mr France was blameless.\u0027There was a suggestion that the defects are in part attributable to negligence or incompetence by Mr France,\u0027 he told the court.\u0027But the documentary records show that there can be no support for that.\u0027Assessing the sum to be paid by DYS, the judge said he had considered whether he should reduce the amount to reflect \u0027the use or benefit\u0027 Mr France gained from the yacht.But he said any benefit he received from his use of the boat was outweighed by \u0027the disappointment, frustration and anger which Mr France must have experienced\u0027.Although he had been able to sail across the Atlantic, his experience was \u0027so very different from what he had hoped\u0027 when he agreed to buy the yacht.\u0027He did not have the enjoyment and pleasure which he had justifiably expected,\u0027 he said. \u0027A very large number of days were spent waiting in marinas for repairs to be done.\u0027The judge awarded Mr France about £900,000 from DYS, based on the reduced value of the boat. Discovery Yachts Group is liable to pay £260,000 in repair costs, he said.On top of that, they must together pick up Mr France\u0027s legal costs bill, which his lawyers have estimated at £432,000.After the hearing, Mr France\u0027s solicitor said he was happy the judgment had \u0027vindicated\u0027 his client.\u0027These repairs can be fixed and she will be a good boat,\u0027 he added.Both DYS and Discovery Yachts Group had their defences \u0027struck out\u0027 at the start of the trial when neither party appeared in court.Shortly before the trial kicked off, \u0027notice of an intention to place DYG into administration\u0027 had also been served, the judge said."},{"url":null,"title":"Ethiopia launches satellite space backed China","story":"Share this article It is the eighth launch of an African satellite this year, topping the previous record of seven in 2017, according to Temidayo Oniosun, managing director of Space in Africa, a Nigeria-based firm that tracks African space programmes.\u0027We can say that 2019 is pretty much the best year in the history of the African space industry,\u0027 Oniosun said.The launch makes Ethiopia the eleventh African country to have a satellite into space. Egypt was the first in 1998.         Former Primer Minister of Ethiopia Hailemariam Dessalegn (right), and Ambassador of the Peoples Republic of China in Ethiopia Tan Jian (left) attend the ceremony for the launching of the Ethiopian Remote Sensing Satellite (ETRSS) in Entoto Observatory and Research Centre in Addis Ababa todayAll told, 41 African satellites have now been launched -- 38 from inidual countries and three more that were multilateral efforts, Oniosun said.None of those launches has taken place from African soil. The country\u0027s space programme was originally championed by private iniduals, who formed the Ethiopian Space Science Society (ESSS) in 2004.Paulos Alemayehu, a longtime member of the group, said many were at first sceptical of the organisation\u0027s ambitions to develop an Ethiopian satellite.\u0027They were saying, \u0027In a country where tap water is not even reaching the upper stories of buildings, what the hell are you talking about?\u0027\u0027 he recalled.        Members of a music band arrive to the ceremony for the launching of the Ethiopian Remote Sensing Satellite (ETRSS) in Entoto Observatory and Research Centre in Addis Ababa, on December 20, 2019Paulos credited Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed for taking a special interest in the programme and for encouraging the partnership with China when he served as minister of science and technology in 2015 and 2016.The government established the Ethiopian Space Science and Technology Institute in 2016.At a press briefing ahead of Friday\u0027s launch, Innovation and Technology Minister Getahun Mekuria said the satellite would ultimately save Ethiopia money as the country would no longer need to pay for remote-sensing data from foreign satellites.\u0027After the launch of the ETRSS-1 is done, we will work to be self-sufficient maybe at our third or fourth satellite, using our own domestic system,\u0027 he said.The importance of the data provided by the new satellite is secondary to the sense of pride it can instill in Ethiopians, Paulos said.Ethiopia, which has a population of more than 100 million, has one of the world\u0027s fast-growing economies. GDP expanded annually at 9.9 per cent on average from 20078 to 201718, according to the World Bank.\u0027For us as a society, we are valuing this launch as something which lifts our national pride,\u0027 Paulos said.\u0027You know, this is a very poor country. Many in the younger generation don\u0027t have big hopes of reaching space.

The residency issue was a convenient method of terminating his membership.\u0027         Retired Australian lawyer John Cawood won his case against Sunningdale Golf Club in Hampshire, pictured, over allegations it terminated overseas membership because he was playing too often. Mr Cawood paid £975 for overseas membership compared with £3,245 for full membership The court heard that Mr Cawood was an overseas member of the club from 1997 to 2015, paying £975-a-year, considerably less than the £3,245-a-year full membership fee.Overseas members had all of the same rights as full members, although their use of the golf course was limited to only 30 days\u0027 play per year, said the judge.The club said his membership was terminated after years of concern about the amount of time he was spending at Sunningdale, as shown by his use of a payment card.In the 11 months before his membership was ended, he had been physically present on 94 days, strongly suggesting to the committee that he was resident in the UK.The club said the termination of his overseas membership did not mean he was prevented from being a member, as he could apply for full membership, but didn\u0027t.Taking the case to court, Mr Cawood applied for an injunction and damages payment, claiming that the club committee was wrong in saying he was not resident abroad.         The court heard that former club captain John Jermine had \u0027an underlying dislike of Mr Cawood and the intent to be rid of him\u0027 Despite having lived in accommodation close to Sunningdale, he insisted that he is an Australian with no intention of changing his permanent home to any other country.\u0027Australia is my real home for all the obvious reasons,\u0027 he told the judge. \u0027Much as I like the US and love the UK, my emotional and historic ties are to Australia.\u0027Mr Cawood\u0027s lawyers claimed he was disliked by some members, which fed into the committee\u0027s \u0027biased\u0027 decision to terminate his membership.Ruling on the case today, Judge Saunders said there were \u0027numerous examples of the committee\u0027s ill feeling\u0027 towards Mr Cawood.Former club captain John Jermine had claimed in an email that Mr Cawood was \u0027continuing to use the club as his country club with no apparent remorse\u0027.The evidence heard in the trial showed Mr Jermine\u0027s \u0027underlying dislike of Mr Cawood and the intent to be rid of him,\u0027 the judge added.\u0027Such evidence does not just flow from Mr Jermine,\u0027 he continued.\u0027In a draft letter to several club members, Mr Leslie McNeile, then the captain, made a thinly veiled threat of disciplinary proceedings against those members should they invite Mr Cawood to attend the club as a visitor.\u0027It is not clear whether the letter was sent but the fact that it was mentioned in a draft is indicative of the attitude of those on the committee that they would consider threatening disciplinary proceedings against members just for inviting Mr Cawood as a guest.\u0027\u0027The club allowed themselves to concentrate wrongly on the days that he spent in the club by reference to his swipe cards.\u0027Whilst I accept that this may be some evidence upon which to reach the decision that they did, it was insufficient to determine permanent residence in the UK. This is again irrational.\u0027I am also concerned that, at least within some of the members of the committee, there was a strong feeling of dislike motivated by their view that the claimant was taking advantage of his overseas membership...\u0027The judge said Mr Cawood and his partner live a \u0027peripatetic\u0027 lifestyle, iding their time between three different countries.\u0027I find that the time they spend in one country will often depend on their personal circumstances at any particular time,\u0027 he said.\u0027I am therefore satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, and upon the evidence, that he is not permanently resident in the UK.\u0027On balance, I do not believe that he has any intention of setting up home here.\u0027The fact that he used the club whilst he was in the UK is just a natural consequence of his lifestyle at that time.\u0027The judge made an injunction, reinstating Mr Cawood\u0027s membership, and awarded him £250 damages for the \u0027embarrassment\u0027 caused.\u0027This is an emotive type of case,\u0027 he said.\u0027Membership of any sports club - particularly where one is a longstanding member and where sport is a love of one\u0027s life - is extremely important.\u0027To certain people, where golf is concerned, such a membership is more than simply playing golf - to many it is a lifestyle choice and with a significant social element.\u0027Mr Cawood is a longstanding member, enjoys playing golf and having use of the facilities.\u0027Sunningdale Golf Club is a top prestigious club and if he were, for example, to seek membership at another club then it would be very difficult for him to find an equivalent alternative - if at all.\u0027He has many of his closest friends there.\u0027He added: \u0027I accept that there will inevitably be some difficulty due to the clash of personalities evident in the oral evidence I heard but, in such a large club, I am satisfied that the risk of that would be small, that the parties as a whole are sensible, and that any tension or conflict could easily be managed and avoided.\u0027Mr Cawood brought his case against several inidual members as representatives of the whole membership, but the judge said effectively the case was against the club itself. "},{"url":null,"title":"Whistleblower claims airports unsafe TSA reduces metal detector sensitivity speed lines","story":"Share this articleAAA Says 115.6 Million Travelers will Break Holiday Records | AAA NewsRoomCNN Exclusive: Whistleblower says US airports becoming unsafe as TSA relaxes security measures in favor of speeding up lines - CNNPoliticsMore people are flying but TSA lines at LAX are shorter.

She is there, watching and listening to her characters, often drawing us aside to try to explain their actions. Wise, ironical, psychologically subtle, she speaks to us in the first person. If she is sometimes sententious, it is because she is passing on hard-won lessons. We can feel sure that the narrator of an Eliot novel is the author, reaching out to her readers.As her novel’s title confesses, Kathy O’Shaughnessy is another of Eliot’s readers who has become a devotee. Her biofiction is a kind of homage, timed to coincide with the bicentenary of Eliot’s birth. After a short prologue, in which Marian Evans, in her early 30s, arrives in London to work for John Chapman, editor of the Westminster Review, there is a jolt forward in time to cover the whole of her life as the novelist “George Eliot”. The novel gives special attention to the half-fearful, half-mischievous charade of authorial concealment, in the period when her first two works of fiction, Scenes of Clerical Life and Adam Bede, were published to acclaim, but almost no one knew her true identity. It goes on to fictionalise Eliot’s years of fame, as she turned, in the eyes of many, from novelist to sage.O’Shaughnessy’s title refers not just to her own literary passion. The book depicts the ways in which Eliot drew others in devotion to her. The most important was George Henry Lewes, a married man deserted by his wife Eliot fearlessly challenged the conventions of her age by living as “Mrs Lewes” for 25 years. Working from their surviving letters, O’Shaughnessy successfully recreates their literary comradeship their true intimacy proves harder to represent. Major roles are also given to some of her female admirers, especially the feminist Edith Simcox, who sat (quite literally) at her feet and expressed her fevered devotion to “mother” in her autobiographical Monument to the Memory of George Eliot. And there is the adoring Johnny Cross, 20 years Eliot’s junior, who began as her financial adviser but ended up, after Lewes’s death, as her husband. Famous men such as Henry James and Anthony Trollope trip in and out, but, not being exactly in love with Eliot, are only bit-part players.In Eliot-like fashion, the narration moves between the viewpoints of different characters, though we are most often in the head of “Madonna” herself. Some of the time her thoughts seem too much like the admiring novelist’s own opinions. “Was anybody else doing what she was doing? She asked herself … Her realism struck deeper than Dickens’ and Thackeray’s.” At other times, her private musings are surprisingly believable – as when she is solacing herself after Lewes’s death by reading through the Divine Comedy with Cross, whom she is tutoring in Dante’s Italian, and falling for him as she does so.The novelist enters where biographers cannot tread. Eliot’s feelings as Cross courts her, about which we know very little, are rendered in convincing complexity, O’Shaughnessy having schooled herself in Eliot’s respect for human contradictoriness. The novel gives us plenty on the honeymoon in Venice, where Cross notoriously threw himself from an upstairs window of their hotel into the Grand Canal. (Heatstroke, sleep deprivation and the strain of being married to the most famous woman in Europe leading to a moment of madness, as imagined here.) Yet his behaviour is no more explicable in this novel than it is in any of the biographies.Elsewhere, the filling in of unknowable details is modest. Marian Evans does engage in tender embraces with the alluring John Chapman and one day, when the servants are off and his wife and children are in Brighton, she falls into bed with him. The biographers could only suspect as much. There is no doubt that O’Shaughnessy has saturated herself in the most important biographical and critical literature on Eliot. The narrative is larded with passages from Eliot’s own letters and journals. O’Shaughnessy has also plundered these for shards of her dialogue there is a great deal of Eliot uncontestably there in the novel.There is also something of our latter-day author. Interleaved with the biofiction are chapters set in the present day, featuring an academic called Kate who works at a fictional London university and is trying to write a novel about Eliot, “based on fact – biography, letters, diaries”. She has a tiresome friend and colleague called Anne, who is writing a feminist attack on the author for not being politically more radical and runs a conference entitled “George Eliot: Saint or Hypocrite?” Meanwhile, Anne’s husband, another academic, solemnly flirts with her. He and Kate end up together at another Eliot conference in Venice, Eliot’s own honeymoon destination. The novelist’s alter ego, as we presume her to be, quotes passages from The Mill on the Floss to soften his heart. Whether we need this proof of Eliot’s capacity to improve our lives is doubtful.• In Love With George Eliot is published by Scribe (£16.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

But why were its backers – the House of Saud among them – so keen to pour billions into it in the first place? By  Matthew ZeitlinIt’s so easy to focus on Adam Neumann, the tall, long-haired, barefoot, meat-banning, weed-smoking, tequila-drinking, Kabbalah-studying, experimental school-opening Paltrow-cousin-in-law and founder and now deposed chief executive officer of the We Company, the real estate company that dropped “Work” from its name after it bought the copyright for the word “We” from Neumann himself.Neumann’s ambitions were as ludicrous as his persona. “Rather than just renting desks,” Fast Company reported in January, “the company aims to encompass all aspects of people’s lives, in both physical and digital worlds.” This included expanding the WeWork model to residential housing and education. Before Neumann had even started the company, he had envisioned “WeSleep to WeSail to WeBank”. While none of these will ever be realised, perhaps he was right to think beyond office space subleasing. The company as he had built it is in crisis.Everything went wrong for WeWork soon after it publicly filed documents for an initial public offering of shares, on 14 August. Six weeks later, Neumann had voted to remove himself from the CEO job and given up his majority control of WeWork’s stock. The company’s proposed valuation had fallen by more than half, and the IPO had been called off entirely. The failed IPO and the company’s subsequent takeover by SoftBank, its largest investor, were both facilitated by the public exposure of long-known information: WeWork was losing a ton of money its projections of the size of the market for shared office space (up to $3tn) were wildly optimistic (it counted anyone who worked at a desk in an American city where there was a WeWork as a potential “member” in non-US cities with WeWorks, the estimate applied to anyone with an office job) and its corporate culture and strategy were completely in hock to Neumann and his family’s bizarre ideas and whims.The company’s business model had been known to be expensive and have little path to profitability since at least 2015, when BuzzFeed first published documents WeWork had used to solicit investors. Neumann’s weird behaviour, meanwhile, had been part of the sales pitch from the very beginning. What seemed to make this year’s WeWork stories different, and more damaging, was the addition of alleged self-dealing and self-enrichment by Neumann to the core model of leasing office buildings, transforming them into “shared” workspaces, providing free beer to tenants, and then counting on a rotating cast of freelancers, venture-funded startups and some larger corporations to pay rents that could be as short as a month at a time. But Neumann’s propensity to sell stock and lease buildings he partially owned back to WeWork wasn’t news either – it was exposed by the Wall Street Journal earlier this year, before the trouble started.The more sceptical sections of the financial press have always had WeWork’s number, even when the company’s footprint and valuation were soaring. In 2017, the Wall Street Journal’s indefatigable Neumann correspondent Eliot Brown described “A $20 Billion Startup Fueled by Silicon Valley Pixie Dust”. It was all there: his casual transubstantiation of office space subleasing into something more like software (he had told investors they were buying into a “physical social network”), as well as the doubts from anyone who knew about his actual business – real estate – that the company was worth $20bn, let alone the $47bn it was valued at in its last round of private fundraising, let alone the more than $100bn Morgan Stanley reportedly told the company it could be worth.What happened since August wasn’t the consequence of the kind of investigative journalism that felled Theranos, or the long-foreshadowed public tumble of an Uber. It was more akin to the kind of frenzied group condemnations that emanate from Twitter every so often. Widely known facts were re-aired in a new climate. What was once amusing or somewhat confusing was now, in a new light, merely horrifying. But this time, instead of hopped-up teenagers hurling moralistic condemnation at mediocre TV shows, it was middle-aged men condemning a 220-page financial statement on Twitter, in real time.Past exposés of WeWork’s kooky business practices and sunny projections had relied on documents distributed to potential venture investors. When WeWork turned to the bond market last year to borrow hundreds of millions, it had to deliver some more revelations. What the investor documents showed, amid all the fantastical profit projections, was that in 2017 WeWork had lost $883m, despite having some $886m in revenue. A leak to the Financial Times revealed that in 2018 the company managed to lose $1.9bn on some $1.8bn of revenue.Throughout all this, Neumann was being Neumann. His private jet trips may have involved some incidental transportation of marijuana across international borders, his wife may have fired employees for their bad vibes, and the company may have ended a meeting announcing layoffs with a performance by a member of Run-DMC.But Neumann’s leadership and loose corporate culture wasn’t all surfing in the Males, guitar-shaped houses and expensive experimental schools, according to one lawsuit. A former WeWork employee alleged last year in a civil case that she was groped or forcibly kissed at corporate events, including at an alcohol-fuelled WeWork “Summer Camp”, and that her complaints resulted in little attention from human resources and little to no action against her alleged assailants. She was later fired.“The sexual harassment and assaults of Plaintiff did not happen in a vacuum,” the employee’s complaint read. “They are product in part of the entitled, frat-boy culture that permeates WeWork from the top down.” The former employee specifically mentioned that during her job interview with Neumann, he served shots of tequila and that “company managers and executives heap immense pressure on employees to attend after-work events and place a premium on employees’ participation in the parties that WeWork sponsors”. The company said she had been fired for poor performance.What transformed WeWork from an investor darling into a pariah didn’t belong to any predetermined boom-and-bust model, and it wasn’t about prosaic investor concerns, like future cash flows. According to the great Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine, WeWork’s downfall could only be explained in abstract terms. Something about what happened – and the speed with which it occurred – seemed unknowable.Levine pointed out that at its peak valuation, WeWork was worth almost half the entire value of publicly traded US real estate investment trusts: “Nobody gets into venture capital because the best-case scenario is doubling their money.” Such returns would be far too small. “For WeWork, maximal office-landlording success would be kind of disappointing,” wrote Levine. More ambitious schemes were required. If you could somehow build a company that included micro-apartments, software and schools, then, sure, why not? Maybe it really would be worth $100bn someday. Or, at least, if people as smart as WeWork’s venture capital investors bought into this, then surely the less sophisticated asset managers that buy into IPOs would, too.That’s not how things worked out. Private investors are supposed to be long-term thinkers – especially SoftBank, which claims it wants “to create an ecosystem that will continue to grow for 300 years”. But WeWork’s investors folded quickly, suddenly demanding from the company the focus and discipline critics had been saying was missing for years. Maybe some of the more dour and anonymous asset managers expected the CEO of a nearly $50bn company to act like one, while his venture capital investors wanted him to maintain his overwhelming ambition.But it was precisely those investors, SoftBank and the Silicon Valley venture firm Benchmark, that forced him out. What was strange was that they knew better than anyone that WeWork really did need to raise more money to address its endemic cash burning. Even Levine admitted to being a little stumped: “WeWork’s investors, particularly SoftBank, were there because of Neumann’s upside, his ability to sell a wild vision of WeWork as a transformative company that can dominate the world and justify a $47bn private valuation. And now, nah, never mind, office landlord.”Unlike real estate booms past, WeWork’s subleasing spree won’t leave behind many monuments: no half-built skyscraper complexes in Kuala Lumpur, no pointless airports in rural Spain. Instead the money found its way into already existing infrastructure, made visible only by discreet signs or logos on windows scattered on office buildings in New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Boston.WeWork had consistently promoted itself as “asset light”: its buildings leased from developers, then, after being subided, rented out on a short-term basis. This lightness will stand out as WeWork’s true innovation, in two ways. The first was that by signing leases, as opposed to buying or even building, it could grow incredibly quickly, as long as it was able to raise enough money to cough up rent. It also built light. Contra its loudest critics, WeWork is more than just marketing, spin and pineapple water. It has used all of that atmospherical ephemera to convince workers – whether they’re freelancers or employees of fast-growing companies that can’t build out their own space quickly enough – that they don’t need as much space as they might have thought. One estimate puts WeWork’s square footage per “member” at around 50 sq ft, well short of the office average of 250. WeWork is thus able to charge high rents for substantially less space than its competitors.But because of its pretensions to being a technology company, the offering to tenants is famously flexible: you can rent month to month and can easily expand or shrink your space according to your needs. For WeWork, this means that the revenue can vary substantially over a year. If there were ever a large drop in demand for flexible office space, WeWork would still have its own lease payments to contend with. In its company filings, WeWork placed its average lease length at 15 years and wrote that it was on the hook for some $47bn worth of payments, with only $4bn of revenue commitments from members. The company is essentially renting long and subleasing short, leaving itself exposed to the same risk as financial institutions that fund themselves with short-term borrowing while maintaining long-term funding commitments.A model this risky requires an unusual source of investment, and these days SoftBank is the most unusual of all. Or perhaps the second most unusual, after its own partner: the Saudi government. A year before SoftBank’s Saudi-backed Vision Fund poured $4.4bn into WeWork, in 2017, the Saudis invested directly in Uber. WeWork and Uber’s involvement with the Saudi government raised hackles in the press. For a while, before the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, the two companies were able to pitch themselves as liberalising forces in Saudi Arabia, helped along by the government’s eventual announcement that women would finally be able to drive. But when the Saudis attempted to host a “Davos in the desert” investment conference soon after Khashoggi’s murder, several technology and finance executives dropped out. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s brutal purge of the Saudi elite investor class had not provoked much of an outcry from the American public and business class neither had the brutal war against Yemen. The dismemberment of a journalist, overseen by some of the prince’s closest advisers, was different.Khashoggi’s killing was so shocking and blunt that even SoftBank’s CEO, Masayoshi Son, was compelled to condemn it. But that was as far as Son went. He would stay in business with the Saudis because SoftBank had “accepted the responsibility to the people of Saudi Arabia … to help them manage their financial resources and ersify their economy”.It is in this nexus – between the Japanese telecom company trying to turn itself into an investor betting on a global technology revolution, a cash-rich nation trying to ersify its economy and embed itself into non-energy global markets, and an ambitious entrepreneur trying to raise as much money as possible – that the WeWork mania and Neumann’s behaviour come into focus.When it comes to Neumann, there are two erging theories. In one telling, he let his ambition get ahead of his abilities to run a profitable business: he was simply taking what money was available and pouring it back into the company, trying to deliver the impressive revenue growth that venture capital investors supposedly want. In a different telling, suggested by another one of WeWork’s great chroniclers, the journalist Reeves Wiedeman, Neumann is the genius of this period of venture capital mania. His deal to give up control over the company in SoftBank’s acquisition of majority control over it only proves it further: the Japanese conglomerate is buying $1bn of WeWork stock from Neumann along with an $185m consulting fee and $500m in order to pay off a loan from JPMorgan – and, the Wall Street Journal reported, covering $1.75m he owed the company for using the company’s private jet for “surf vacations and other jaunts”. Neumann may have become a laughing stock, but he is a very rich laughing stock.One of the great mysteries of modern finance is how to make money when you know there’s a bubble, or at least how to get much, much richer than everyone else. The obvious way is to bet against the bubble, but this is difficult, as its expansion can easily outlast one’s ability to finance the wager. It’s even harder if the bubble is primarily happening in the private markets, where it is very difficult, if not impossible, to directly bet against the fortunes of a company that you think is overvalued. What you can do, however, is try to find a way to soak up as much money as possible from optimistic investors and then furiously distribute it to yourself and your family, so that by the time things turn, you’re already rich.And to properly pull this off, you would need to find investors with a lot of money that they felt obligated to spend. It was just as important for WeWork to serve as a parking place for Saudi and Japanese cash as it was to provide office space for burgeoning businesses. In the introduction to SoftBank’s most recent annual report, Son thanks shareholders for their support as “we continue to move forward, inspired by our belief in the power of technology to build a more connected, efficient, and joyful world, as expressed by our corporate philosophy: ‘Information Revolution – Happiness for Everyone.’” He goes on to hail the coming “AI Revolution, which is poised to redefine all industries – including education, health care, real estate and finance, as well as the advertising and retail sectors”. This revolution will, Son intends, be funded by SoftBank.The scale suggested by Son’s plan is massive – literally all industrial output for the rest of human history – and it has been matched by the Vision Fund, which raised almost $100bn, including a $45bn commitment from Saudi Arabia. But you still have to invest the money, or, as Son put it, “take the helm of a group of companies led by top AI entrepreneurs from all different fields, much like a preeminent orchestra made up of virtuosos on scores of instruments, and help them harmonise, while creating additional value along the way”.Unlike traditional venture capital funds that might raise, at most, a few billion from wealthy families and pension funds, SoftBank needed to raise much, much more, because its strategy was different. When those traditional venture capital firms are confronted with a bizarre, failed investment, more often than not they will shrug it off, pointing out that their overall returns are overwhelmingly generated from a few hugely successful bets. This model is most effective with software companies, which require some startup capital to hire engineers and start selling a product, but then can quickly turn into highly profitable businesses as they find a market and mature.But as the technology industry grew, the market for funding tech companies changed. Following the financial crisis, interest rates fell to rock-bottom levels, cash piled up on companies’ balance sheets and in the hands of the ultra-wealthy, and regulatory changes made going public quickly less attractive. Technology companies were able to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from mutual funds, sovereign wealth funds, and other huge pools of capital when, 10 years earlier, they would have had to sell their shares to the public. But the resources and eagerness on the part of these funds – and the wealthy families that spent as lavishly – would come to mean what one might call over-investment.While the cost of starting a traditional startup has plummeted thanks to cheaply available server access from Amazon, companies that, in the parlance of the industry, move “atoms” (stuff) instead of “bits” (code) can be ruinously expensive to run. Whether it’s the cost of leasing and building out new locations for WeWork, or the torrent of rider discounts and driver bonuses that Uber and Lyft pay out to start up new markets, these companies eat through investor cash for years in order to survive.Looking backwards through the telescope, the mega-funding for app-based taxi-cab dispatchers and beer-distributing office subleasers makes more sense as a case of savvy operators creating landing zones for massive flows of cash, of demand for big “tech” investments creating a supply of them, which can then be sold as the next big thing. What distinguishes many of these companies, especially ones that have received investment from SoftBank, is their neither-fish-nor-fowl, real worldsoftware nature, along with their insatiable need for capital. As popular business analyst Ben Thompson has argued, the Vision Fund may have confused companies that need lots of capital with companies that offer big opportunities, resulting in a “paucity of tech companies” in its portfolio and instead a collection of Wags and WeWorks.So why did the Saudi government want to pour money into companies selected seemingly almost at random by a charismatic and eccentric Japanese businessman? The resulting fit between the Saudis and Neumann was not just awkward for business reasons, but also cultural. Not because Neumann is Israeli, or likes weed and tequila, but because to a degree unusual even by startup-founder standards, WeWork had wrapped itself in gauzy rhetoric about its ability to change the world. This led to predictable tension when it turned out that the company’s biggest funder was Saudi Arabia, a country ruled by an authoritarian regime and where religious authorities still exercise tremendous control over everyday life.In the old days – which is to say before 2017 – Saudi leaders were content for their relationship with the US to be relatively discreet. Ever the flashy millennial, Bin Salman wanted more attention, touring the US in 2018 and publicly wooing the most visible instantiations of the American imperium: technology executives, prominent journalists, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. As part of his much-ballyhooed “opening” of Saudi Arabia, he even allowed an American movie to be screened on Saudi soil. The film told the story of an ambitious young king seeking to open up his rich but isolated country to the world: Black Panther.The attempted ersification of Saudi Arabia’s economy has occasionally veered off into farce, like when the government tasked western consulting firms with implementing Bin Salman’s dreams of a future city in the Arabian desert called Neom. (According to the Wall Street Journal, Neom would feature a beach that supposed to glow “like the face of a watch”, as well as a “robo-cage fight”, “one of many sports on offer”.)If Neom and Bin Salman’s American grand tour were the most visible attempts in a wider plan to become something more than an oil supplier to the modern corporate technology world, then the cheque written to SoftBank is the downpayment. And if WeWork is what happens when capital is in the hands of resource-rich autocracies, futurist telecom executives and cash-rich mature companies, perhaps it can serve as a launching point for thinking about how capital would behave differently under the aegis of democratic control.The “We” in WeWork was the customers working in the offices, living in the apartment buildings, and learning in the schools – not the people determining where any of this was built, and in what quantity. If money is indeed piling up on the balance sheets of large corporations and in the coffers of the Saudi treasury as proceeds for burning the planet – and if that money is ultimately at the disposal of a farseeing Japanese mobile phone mogul – one might ask if it could be managed differently if it were in the hands of, well, “We”.A longer version of this article first appeared at nplusonemag• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46eeb96a7e81e5d9c65d15d212ffbd21aeff77d2/0_792_4222_2532/master/4222.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a47defa7a1f39a8fd7a395ba3701556","title":"andrea leadsom approves takeover of cobham defence firm by us company","story":"Ministers sign off on £4bn deal saying it won’t compromise national security The government has given the green light to a £4bn takeover of UK defence company Cobham by a US private equity firm.A merger between the Dorset-based manufacturer and US firm Advent was agreed to in July, however the acquisition was delayed so that the government could address national security concerns raised by the takeover.The government officially signed off on the merger on Friday night, after Advent proposed a number of legal undertakings aimed at mitigating any potential national security concerns.These include the ongoing protection of sensitive government information and requiring prior notice to the Ministry of Defence and Home Office on any future plans to sell the Cobham business.Lady Nadine Cobham said the decision was “deeply disappointing” and accused the government of timing the announcement to avoid scrutiny.The founding family of the business had called for the government to intervene earlier this year, arguing the takeover was not in “the UK’s national interests”. The business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, who led the government consultation process, said she was confident that the merger would not compromise national security.The company employs around 10,000 people, including 1,700 in the UK, and is best known for its air-to-air refuelling technology.“This decision has been meticulously thought over, and I have taken advice from the defence secretary, the deputy national security adviser and government officials across multiple departments. I have also met with both of the companies on several occasions, as have several senior members of my department,” Leadsom said.“Having considered the consultation responses and further advice from the defence secretary, I am satisfied that the undertakings mitigate the national security risks identified to an acceptable level and have therefore accepted them and cleared the merger to proceed.”Leadsom said the companies had given legally binding commitments that there will be “significant protection” of jobs and have agreed that the Cobham’s headquarters will remain the the UK.Lady Cobham said: “This is a deeply disappointing announcement and one cynically timed to avoid scrutiny on the weekend before Christmas.“In one of its first major economic decisions, the government is not taking back control so much as handing it away.“In Cobham we stand to lose yet another great British defence manufacturer to foreign ownership, through a takeover that would never have been approved by the Americans, French or Japanese, all of whom have taken steps recently to raise protections for their own defence sectors.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfc217bd8c2c3a89dc6191540fa8ed173f8ebfcc/102_182_1053_632/master/1053.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65138c6dba6d0043fdd1f66dffbdde1c","title":"how do you stop a megacity grinding to a halt a cartoon","story":"Until four years ago Dar Es Salaam had no public transport.

But for the left to end its losing streak, it must choose someone phenomenalThere’s a hard truth for anyone who stands on the left side of the political ide, a truth demonstrated again in recent days. Put starkly, the left usually loses. In the UK, Labour has governed for just 30 of the last 85 years. Of the eight men who have been president of the French fifth republic, only two have been socialists. In the postwar tally of US presidents, Republicans outnumber Democrats.There are countless reasons for this, but here’s one to contemplate in a week when the reality of a fourth consecutive election defeat for Labour slowly sinks in (very slowly in some quarters), and as Democrats contemplate poll numbers showing that even as Donald Trump becomes only the third president in US history to be impeached he still enjoys an edge over his leading Democratic rivals in the battleground states likely to decide the election next November.A look at recent electoral history suggests an uncomfortable pattern. Not only is the left’s default setting to lose it wins only when led by someone who is not merely good, but a phenomenon. In the US, it has taken a Bill Clinton or a Barack Obama – exceptional political communicators of once-in-a-generation talent – to break the Republican winning streak. In the UK, it took a Tony Blair – who all but the most stubborn critics will concede was an uncommonly gifted political operator – to become the only Labour leader born in the last 100 years to win a general election.There is an asymmetry here, for the right can win power without offering a leader who dazzles. For parties promising to maintain the status quo and keep things ticking over, a George Bush (junior or senior) or John Major will do. That rarely cuts it for the centre-left. Unless the country is recoiling from a predecessor so discredited that voters long for an antidote whose very ordinariness becomes appealing – think Jimmy Carter after Watergate or François Hollande after Nicolas Sarkozy – the party of change usually loses unless it is led by a candidate of extraordinary charisma.That’s also true of populist movements, who need a Trump, Matteo Salvini, Nigel Farage or Marine Le Pen figure at the top because, unlike regular parties of the right, “it’s all they’ve got. They can’t promise governing competence or stability,” says the Labour peer Andrew Adonis, who has studied leadership closely. But the burden falls especially heavily on the left. They are demanding the nation give up what’s familiar and head instead into uncharted territory. That requires a charismatic leader. For, to cite (again) the words of an old teacher of mine, the late Ze’ev Mankowitz, “People don’t believe in ideas: they believe in people who believe in ideas.”And yet, for a quality so determinative of political success or failure, it is maddeningly hard to define charisma, even if we feel we can spot its presence – or absence – in seconds. At its most basic, it begins with elementary communication skills. Would a TV channel choose this or that candidate to read the news? Applying that criterion to 1994, you’d have known in an instant that, had it come to a contest, Blair would have beaten Gordon Brown. Obvious.But there is so much more to it than that. Charisma is a shifting, evolving quality, changing in reaction to the times and especially to whatever has gone before. The tightly managed political style of the Blair-Clinton era left voters weary of candidates who were polished and spun, hankering instead for something apparently more authentic, even dangerous. Today the key TV test is whether you’d turn the sound up to hear what they say, not least because you wouldn’t be sure what was about to come out of their mouth.Trump is the master of that form of unpredictability Boris Johnson built a career on the frisson of appearing to defy convention and say things politicians aren’t meant to say. Of the current Labour field, the only candidate who even comes close to having that quality is Jess Phillips. Stewart Wood, the former adviser to Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband, neither of whom were famed for their charisma, can see Phillips appealing partly because voters will know that “she’ll sometimes screw up and say the wrong thing. She’s visceral. She’s got that unstable, combustible mix”, which can be compelling.For a candidate of the right, that alone can carry you to victory. But it’s so much harder for the left. They have both to excite and reassure, all at the same time. Clinton, Blair and Obama succeeded partly because they calmed those who would normally be resistant to change. To take a niche, but illustrative example: in Israel, the centre-left has won only twice in the last 42 years, on both occasions when they were led by certified military heroes. Both Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak had the credentials to soothe any doubts about security. They were phenomena. Anything less, and their party loses.In less extreme form, it means a left challenger needs to exude gravitas and competence. The model here is Clement Attlee, who could reassure Britons in 1945 not least because he had been at Winston Churchill’s right hand as deputy prime minister throughout the war. What he lacked in sparkle, he made up in heft. His was the kind of anti-charisma offer Brown’s team were aiming to make with their “Not flash, just Gordon” slogan in 2007. We will never know if it would have worked in the election that never was, after which Brown’s image was no longer his to shape. But a left leader has to have at least one of those qualities – authority or charisma – and ideally both. (Supporters of Keir Starmer reckon his record as director of public prosecutions gives him a weight his rivals lack.)What complicates this further is that charisma can be in the eye of the beholder. To me, Jeremy Corbyn always looked like a glowering supply teacher, a man incapable of uttering a single memorable sentence, unable to command a room. In the campaign just gone, it became clear that millions of voters saw him that way too. Yet to thousands of Labour activists, he was an inspiration. What might account for this perception gap is a notion of charisma confined mostly to the left.Corbyn clearly met the post-Blair demand for an unspun, authentic politician, but he also cut a figure with deeper historical resonance. Ascetic, living modestly, with a scraggly beard trimmed only once he won the leadership in 2015, it was easy to see him as the archetypal prophet, summoned from the wilderness after decades spent living in isolation with only his principles for company. Never mind that he’s a boring or repetitive speaker: that only proves his consistency. Never mind the venom of his detractors or even the serial defeats: that only confirms him as a holy man who refuses to bend.Bernie Sanders has some of this appeal in the US, but here’s the key point: for all its roots in religious tradition, this is a form of charisma that today stirs only the left. Study the photograph on the front of Friday’s . It shows a gaunt Corbyn, staring fixedly ahead, alongside a chunky, Falstaffian Johnson, a mischievous smile on his lips. It’s an image as old as England, Roundhead against Cavalier - and we know which side the country reverts to in the end.Democrats need to hold this structural imbalance between left and right in mind as they choose their challenger to Trump. Unfair it might be, but to win that person will need to offer both excitement and solidity, hope and calm. It’s not an easy combination to pull off. Labour is in need of a similarly rare blend. But first it needs to decide what question it is asking. Is it looking for a leader who ticks all the members’ pet ideological boxes, or for someone who might prove capable of interrupting Labour’s long losing streak? By their choice, we’ll know whether they want to win – or to enjoy once more the martyr’s thrill of glorious defeat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69a6ca0dfc185bca588f45ae9b3e649b1b48385a/0_161_6436_3862/master/6436.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a84f14aa80eb2d8da0b01281de1439f","title":"defeat left labour activism party","story":"The left shouldn’t abandon its activism in the party. But it must consider shifting the balance of its energies beyond itDuring a deputation to the White House by civil rights leaders in 1963, President John F Kennedy was asked whether he supported the March on Washington, at which Martin Luther King made his “I have a dream” speech. Kennedy said he didn’t. “We want success in Congress, not just a big show at the Capitol … It seemed to me a great mistake to announce a march on Washington before the bill was even in committee.”It took the trade union leader, and elder African American in the room, A Philip Randolph, to push back. “The Negroes are already in the streets. It is very likely impossible to get them off,” he said. Kennedy was wrong – ultimately “the big show at the Capitol” was central to the success of the civil rights bill in Congress. Without the pressure from below, there would have been no change from the top.The tension between the electoral and the political, the social movement and the legislative process, is an inevitable feature of left politics. Progressive change is ultimately enacted through parliament, but it rarely begins there. Sometimes movements produce parties. The Labour party was created by the labour movement, just as Podemos in Spain was created by the indignados and Green parties emerged from the ecology movement. Sometimes, like the suffragettes, the civil rights movement or the gay rights movements, parties absorb movements. Either way, they find a pathway from the streets to parliament.As the left reflects on its priorities over the next few years, it is worth reassessing whether we have the balance right. Contrary to Tony Blair’s claim that the left turned Labour into a “glorified protest movement”, Labour actually turned the left into a glorified electoral machine. The thousands of people who canvassed in the cold and half-light over the past month were not there to wave placards in central London and preach to the converted, but to knock on doors in marginal constituencies and convert the waverers.A friend who went from Hackney to Milton Keynes, where the Tories held a slender majority, shared his diary entry of election day. “We walked (and sometimes ran) in the freezing rain from house to house to get the vote out. But we were often met on the doorstep with bitterness, a hardness that was brittle like a body that’s turned inwards, tight and hunched-over against the cold and wet.”Despite all its effort, that machine evidently didn’t work. We lost, and lost badly. The Tories increased their majorities in both Milton Keynes constituencies. But that doesn’t mean we didn’t exist or make any difference. Those majorities are still lower now than they were in 2015. For the past four years, the left has spent almost all its energy defending and advancing the gains it has made within Labour. That has made sense. Corbyn was propelled to the leadership not by an organised base of activists but by an inchoate sense of frustration and alienation. He landed amid a hostile parliamentary party, leaving him besieged and isolated. Momentum did not make his leadership possible his leadership made Momentum necessary. It has since galvanised people very effectively on a local and national level.A lot of important things came from that. The advances in vote share and seats in 2017 on a radical and redistributive agenda, a party that doubled in size, a leadership race with a potentially impressive range of candidates in which the battle against austerity and for greater equality mainstream rather than marginal.But I wonder if that strategy makes sense for the next four years. My point here is not that the left should abandon its activism in the party, but that it might want to consider significantly shifting the balance of its energies beyond it. Elections are important. But there is more to politics than elections, and more to power than parliament. Nigel Farage never came close to winning election to the UK parliament: more people voted for Diane Abbott last week than have ever voted for Farage in his seven attempts to become an MP over a quarter of a century. But he has managed to upend our politics and effectively take over the Tory party.There is also more to the left than Labour, and more to Labour than the left. The aim isn’t to abdicate influence but to more efficiently apply it. In a moment when we can expect a significant attack on living standards, workers’ rights, public services, environmental protection and minorities – because that is what happens when Tories win big – the left might focus more on local and national campaigns than holding positions and passing resolutions.So much time has, understandably, been spent examining Corbyn’s unpopularity that we forget that Boris Johnson was the one who was booed and heckled in the street and hospitals during the campaign, and mocked when he said he was trustworthy. The fact that he has a huge majority now does not mean he is not politically vulnerable. It took him less than a week to abandon his commitments to raising the minimum wage, to protecting labour laws and child refugees, and to launch an assault on voter rights with an ID bill that will suppress the vote of the poor and minorities. There is no shortage of issues for the left to get involved in beyond Labour. The Earth certainly can’t wait until 2024.Out in Milton Keynes my friend could feel it slipping away on the day. “With every listed Labour voter that told us ‘I won’t vote for you’ we could tell this was not going to be swinging our way,” he wrote. “Some wards were warmer and our spirits rose – but in truth it was tough, and soon the conversations amongst us started to be about after the election – how we might retain this spirit, this collective energy.”In the midst of dejection and the wake of this defeat, that is the key question for the left. We lost an election we did not lose everything. How do we make sense of what we still have, and move on?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1d7c61713a3bdb384b08379d082fedb12af4eec/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5fe458105468255e54b368a664c8e48","title":"labour older voters corbyn local socialism","story":"Knocking on doors for Labour for more than 100 hours in London, Bedford and Milton Keynes showed me the stark difference in voters’ attitudes by age. Among a section of older, white voters in both more and less affluent areas, I saw a visceral hatred of Jeremy Corbyn, and sometimes Diane Abbott. How did the demonisation of Corbyn and the Labour party under his leadership – as documented by media analysis conducted at the LSE and Loughborough University – impact so strongly with them in 2019 but not in 2017?Although on the face of it that demonisation has been raw and relentless, it actually only circled around a key charge, rarely making it explicit, so it has taken four years for low-engagement voters to absorb it fully.The key charge against Corbyn is that he fundamentally believes British lives are of equal value to the lives of others. His opponents wouldn’t put it so bluntly, but this is what it has always been about. Hence the series of confected outrages – from not bowing deeply enough at the Cenotaph to ruling out pushing the nuclear button – that built a treasonous charge sheet as absurd as it was banal.It seemed impossible to defend Corbyn against this unspoken indictment. Smears such as Corbyn “siding with Putin” over the Salisbury poisoning, when caution about trusting the judgment of British intelligence agencies was cast as support for the Russian version of events, or “supporting” the IRA, gained more traction as time went on.Even Corbyn’s commendable record of campaigning against the geopolitical grain, such as for dispossessed Tamils, Chagossians and Palestinians, came to be seen as evidence that he didn’t know which side he was supposed to be on. A symbolic moment of the campaign was the first leaders’ debate, when Corbyn highlighted the impact that the climate crisis would have on the poorest people in the world and a section of the audience responded with groans and someone shouted, “Here we go again!”When people talk about having paid into the system all their lives, as I heard repeatedly at the doorstep, they’re not just talking about national insurance payments and the benefits they’re entitled to. They’re talking about loyalty to a state they expected to be their exclusive patron – and they saw a Labour leader who seemed to invite the whole world to his allotment, offering homemade jam to all, no matter which flags their ancestors spilt their blood for.With such voters, retired or coming towards the end of their careers, Corbyn’s collectivist language of what we could build together left them sceptical and uncomprehending. It seemed more zero sum to them, where one person’s gain must be another’s loss. A small hoard has been salvaged from the UK’s long post-imperial decline, and only those whose fealty is proven can claim their share.This isn’t about a chauvinistic sense of racial or national superiority. I encountered no Brexit optimism, no sense of “Believe in Britain” boosterism. On the contrary, people were fixated on the inevitability of scarcity, and the need to guard against naive hope.The feeling that Corbyn’s loyalties were too wide for a national leader is a materialist concern, because people worried he would be profligate and squander the security inherited from times when Britain was more powerful. That’s why the leadership was not trusted to deliver the popular policies in the manifesto. Sensible investments such as state-provided broadband came to be seen as giveaways. Taxing the rich was unpersuasive, as many people just thought it impossible. These voters wanted the patronage of the powerful, not to challenge their power.The good news is that people are not crying out for more racism or war. Immigration itself didn’t come up once in all my conversations, and indeed polls show declining hostility to it. Corbyn’s opposition to military adventurism is popular, although his pacifist principles are not.Pandering to so-called legitimate concerns will fail, as it always does for Labour, but so will labelling large chunks of the electorate racist. Despite ethical injunctions to “call out” prejudice, there are no electoral prizes to be won from naming racism as such, except in the most egregious cases. We need to reduce the salience of nativist and nationalist identity. Let’s start by abstaining from the self-indulgence of “gammon” jokes and other temptations to sharpen cultural and intergenerational ides.I also canvassed many young, working-class people who were not engaged with politics. Many had never heard about class politics at all, and expressed confusion and boredom regarding Brexit. The idea of voting for a party to tax the rich to pay for redistribution and public services was completely novel, and generally immediately attractive. It was amazing to see how quickly and instinctively they grasped a leftwing agenda while saying they had never thought about it before.There is a huge opportunity for the left to make inroads with younger non-graduates in towns, but imaginative strategies are needed to reach them, since sending enthusiastic activists out from the cities for a few weeks before an election is too little too late, especially when younger voters are rarely at home to answer the door.Labour still runs local governments across the country. This needs to be seen as an opportunity for popular participation – engagement in civic and political life on a local scale – to combat the feeling of powerlessness that saps the ability of people to imagine a radically different future. With five years in the wilderness at the national level, Labour may have to explore the potential of municipal socialism, as pioneered in Preston and seen in Barcelona.• Luke Pagarani is a trustee of the Human Capability Foundation charity"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74919f0539b9c7d843f2e3ccfda37da9074fec00/0_271_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cef11e932493e9eac3fa2607b8ddc060","title":"roas graffiti animals from around the world in pictures","story":"Belgian graffiti artist ROA is renowned for his colossal monochrome works of endemic and endangered animals adorning buildings around the world.

It has a erse landscape of tropical forests, flooded grasslands, dense coastal mangroves and mudflats.It is also a stop-off point for a number of migratory birds, including American flamingos, osprey and cuckoos. Fishermen say they have seen jaguars – as well as deer, anteaters and buffalo – swimming between the island and mainland.There are 27 jaguars on the island and five to six cats per 100 sq km in some parts. Normally only two to five jaguars would share a territory of this size. The island’s jaguars are believed to hunt deer, buffalo, lizards and monkeys, but a plentiful supply of fish could be the secret to their success, researchers say.Iranildo Coutinho, head of the ecological station on the island, describes it as a “kind of nursery or sanctuary” for jaguars because it may be fuelling populations on the mainland. “The fishermen often say that the island produces jaguars. It is the only coastal island along the coast of the Amazon and this is why it holds very important samples of fauna and coastal vegetation that are very well preserved and act almost like a live laboratory,” he said.The area of mainland adjacent to the island is dangerous for jaguars as there are several buffalo farmers who feel threatened by the presence of the cats. At the end of 2018, a female jaguar was killed with her cub after attacking dogs in the village of Sucuriju, 30 miles (50km) from the island.Jaguars are near threatened according to the IUCN red list, with sharp declines caused by deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade, which targets them for their skin and body parts.The Amazon is the single largest remaining stronghold for jaguars, but it is estimated recent wildfires have destroyed the habitats of 500 iniduals. These cats are one of the largest predators in South America and are often seen as a litmus test for forest health.The satellite technology fitted to the collars of the jaguars on Maracá-Jipioca provides researchers with hourly updates on the animals’ movements. The camera traps have already taken more than 30,000 pictures. Understanding how a predator uses its territory will help researchers learn how to limit inevitable conflicts with humans.WWF conservationists also collected blood samples from the collared jaguars to work out if they are crossing onto the mainland to breed – if not, then they are likely to have a very small gene pool, which could pose a problem for the long-term health of the population.Dr Chris Carbone, a senior research fellow at the Zoological Society of London who is an expert on predator-prey relationships, said the research (in which he was not involved) shows how versatile these cats are. “It is good to see jaguars showing such adaptability, as wildlife in general are increasingly exposed to reductions in their habitats and this ability to adapt may be critical for the future survival of such populations,” he said.“That said, we shouldn’t be complacent. We don’t know how long jaguars have been fishing on these islands. If it is a long-standing behavioural adaptation, it may be that many species are experiencing changes in their habitats which are too sudden to allow for them to adapt.”The research is being carried out in collaboration with the Jaguar Conservation Fund and Chico Mendes Institute for Bioersity Conservation. Jaguar conservationist Lailson Ferreira, who works with WWF on the island, said: “It’s important to preserve this island because this place is a treasure. There are very special creatures here, like the spotted jaguar and many others.”Oliveira added: “Months of meticulous planning went into the mission, but we can never guarantee collaring a wild animal. To have collared three jaguars on this first WWF expedition is an amazing result.“The satellite technology fitted to the collars is providing us with hourly updates on the animals’ movements for up to eight months, resulting in a bank of information on how the jaguars use the forest to live and flourish.”Next year, researchers are setting up more camera traps and in June 2020 they will collar two more jaguars."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de5cc2ba4160c6278b9bb3ad7f2c5d880850c445/0_828_6083_3650/master/6083.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c50a79452b6d358251e37f3103253bd","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the best flora and fauna photos from around the world, from fighting sloths to rescued orangutans"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1e8cf8d3a7ed7a1ac964fe27a8039323beea6d0/367_0_2798_1680/master/2798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed9bd61782907e6e29dc1a9b99bc6616","title":"nuclear nightmares belarus film festival against repression","story":"In a country where history casts a long shadow and authoritarianism reigns, a guerrilla festival team commandeer cinemas to champion liberty – if the KGB don’t get there firstIt’s the opening night of a film festival in Belarus, the forest country on the fault line between Europe and Russia that was devastated in the 20th century. Such evenings usually involve red carpets and movie stars, but this one features a black veil covering a big screen, like a mirror at an Irish wake.It’s a visual shock, something I’ve never seen before. Anti-glamour and morally serious, an electrifying start to a film festival. It makes me think of why I’m here. Thanks to the Russian company Atomstroyexport, Belarus is getting new nuclear reactors, so Watch Docs’ festival director, Tanya Hatsura-Yavorska, asked if they could show my film Atomic: Living in Dread and Promise, a collaboration with the band Mogwai. I loved the idea: the film has been shown near Chernobyl, in Coventry cathedral and in Hiroshima. As Belarus suffered more from the Chernobyl disaster than any country, it would be an honour.Watch Docs planned to show the film in conventional cinemas but, as they’re state owned, the Belarus KGB prevented the screening. Plan B – to show it somewhere atmospheric, like a disused bunker – was also stopped. As I watch the dance macabre on opening night, I still don’t know if Atomic will screen at all. Last night in my bedsit in Minsk, I woke up shouting. In my nightmare, men had broken in, like they arrive in Josef K’s bedroom in Kafka’s The Trial. I had nuclear nightmares in the 80s, but they stopped at the end of the cold war.On opening night, after the anti-capital punishment person, Hatsura-Yavorska speaks. She says Watch Docs is about the limits of freedom and un-freedom. Belarus has had the same president Alexander Lukashenko, since 1994. Authoritarian and dissent-averse, his country has vestiges of Soviet double-speak. She finishes, and the opening film begins. It’s The Trial, a documentary about the imprisonment of Russian-Ukrainian film-maker Oleg Sentsov. In it Sentsov – who has since been released – mocks the Russian legal system and laughs when his sentence is extended. It’s a film about being scared but not afraid, like Hatsura-Yavorska and her team – almost all women – are scared but not afraid. The confidence to cover the screen in black, to ask such serious questions about liberty and cinema. Compared with this, most film festivals look meagre and transient.Days pass. In Minsk’s massive museum of the second world war, I see clips from Elem Klimov’s shattering Belarusian war movie Come and See (recently restored and soon to be rereleased). Nazis herd villagers into a barn and then burn it. The clips are uncredited the museum plays them as if they’re documentary footage.We drive to Khatyn, where there is a memorial to the destroyed villages depicted by Klimov. Bells toll throughout the forest where the village once was. There’s a huge statue of the only adult to survive the atrocity – a man carrying his dead son. Altogether, 628 villages were eradicated by the Nazis. Up to a quarter of the country’s 9 million people are thought to have died. The lowest estimates are 1.5 million. I stand in this December forest, listening to bells that have rung for 50 years, trying to comprehend this. I fail.A day later, I hear that Atomic will be screened – in OK16, a huge railway workshop turned arts venue in the south of Minsk. Ten minutes before it starts, I still don’t know exactly where I’m going. But then I’m in an auditorium with beautiful projection and sound, and there’s a big audience – the power of Facebook – and Tanya is introducing. She says the festival “wanted to show this film somewhere more auspicious, but the three-letter organisation would not let that happen”.We watch Atomic. In its opening scene, a British government official in an old information film says to camera: “The government has decided that, in the present state of international tension, you should be told how to protect yourselves from the dangerous effects of nuclear attack.” It chimes with this place, and with this festival: being told what to do, the fear of thermonuclear disaster.Watch Docs uses films to express fear and push against it. I was scared in Minsk on that first night. After that, I was reminded why movies matter. Though protestors in Belarus risk imprisonment, they’re less scared than the three-letter organisation that tries to corral them. The KGB is afraid of their clarity of thought, seriousness and imagination."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93f28a2c3b1d5786a0b394e08ee125a4fc1fed11/307_0_3460_2076/master/3460.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9bf1ffbeb45147ac98eca626e24e9e6","title":"the best films to stream for christmas 2019","story":"Netflix, Amazon and co are falling over themselves to provide festive viewing for everyone. Here are some top picksWhat to watch at Christmas: an annual point of much debate, deliberation and compromise, usually proven for naught when most of the family falls into a prosecco-laced stupor about 15 minutes into the chosen option. The advent of streaming hasn’t exactly made this process any easier, but the sheer wealth of options at least slightly reduces the possibility of everyone capitulating to the one senior relative stubbornly set on watching the Queen’s speech.Netflix, as you would expect, has made an aggressive play to be the family Christmas channel of choice. From November on, they release a steady stream of original festive-themed films, many with largely interchangeable C-word titles: this year’s offerings include Home for Christmas, A Family Reunion Christmas and A Christmas Prince: The Royal Baby. They’re equal parts awful and enjoyable in the right half-cut spirit, but I reserve a special place in my heart for the oozing, earnest cheese of seasonal safari romcom Holiday in the Wild. Rob Lowe, Kristin Davis and baby elephants: what more does a Christmas need?If you want some family viewing that’s less dependent on a healthy sense of irony, however, Netflix’s Klaus is one of the season’s most pleasant surprises. The platform’s first attempt to join the animation big leagues is an exquisitely designed Santa Claus origin story from Despicable Me creator Sergio Pablos. Kids will enjoy the gently goofy storytelling, while their parents can marvel at its richly animated, pastel-gothic 19th-century story world. It’s likely to become a standard.Elsewhere in their Christmas lineup, Netflix has some pleasingly lateral choices for cross-generational viewing. For slightly older children, Nora Twomey’s gorgeous animated Afghanistan survival story The Breadwinner offers apt, hopeful family values without sugary sentiment, while this year’s delightful, Florence Pugh-led teen-wrestler tale Fighting With My Family is an upbeat romp with some relative grit and texture to it. (Both are streaming from 24 December.)Dirty God (Modern Films, 15)Perhaps not optimum holiday viewing, but a very fine film, Newcomer Vicky Knight is shattering in Sacha Polak’s candid, compassionate study of a young burns victim reasserting her identity in hostile environs.Never Look Away (Modern Films, 15) This Oscar-nominated three-hour saga based loosely on the life of artist Gerhard Richter poses as a return to form for The Lives of Others director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck: it’s handsome and intelligent, but a wee bit turgid.Dilili in Paris (Prime Video)The latest from veteran French animator Michel Ocelot bypassed cinemas and DVD, but is worth a stream for animation buffs. Its mix of traditional techniques with 3D rendering fascinates even when its slender story – a kidnapping plot in belle époque Paris – palls.

Klopp says his respect has increased for the Club World Cup during his time in the Gulf state although, with 15,000 fans expected to travel from Brazil to support the Copa Libertadores winners, he admits South American passion for the competition remains unrivalled.Brazilian clubs have won the title 10 times in its various guises compared with two English triumphs, both by Manchester United. Flamengo’s 3-0 victory over Liverpool in the Intercontinental Cup 38 years ago has been celebrated in song and on banners by their supporters in Doha. But Klopp insists Liverpool’s ambition to add the Club World Cup to Anfield’s roll of honour is as strong as the backing for the Brazilian champions.Klopp, who has Virgil van Dijk available, said: “I don’t know how you approach something that has never been done before – it is like landing on the moon.“We are playing against a side from a country and continent where this competition means everything to everyone and, in England, we have to explain why we come here. That’s how Europe looks at the world, that we are the centre of attention.“Flamengo got sent here from their country with a clear order: win it and come back as heroes. We got told: stay at home and play the Carabao Cup. That’s a massive difference, and we cannot change that, but we are here and my team wants to win the competition. Since we are here we respect it more and more because you get a feeling for it. You watch the games and it is all or nothing with everyone fighting for everything.“So we saw that, adapted to it, won our semi-final in a very difficult situation and now we try to do the same against a very good side that finished their season on a super high by turning everything around from eight points behind to 16 points in front while winning the Copa Libertadores too.”Van Dijk completed his first full training session on Friday since arriving in Qatar, having missed the semi-final defeat of Monterrey through illness. Although the competition may be regarded differently in Europe and South America, Klopp insists that will not be the case between the teams.“It is how it sounds: the team world cup winner. You don’t often get the chance to do so and for most of them, with the countries they play for, they never have a chance to win a World Cup so this is the only chance. For me as well. But who cares about me? I don’t feel pressure but I feel a really big opportunity and I want to do it.”Klopp will become the first German coach to win the Club World Cup in its current form should Liverpool emerge victorious. Compatriots Ottmar Hitzfeld and Dettmar Cramer won the Intercontinental Cup with Bayern Munich. The Liverpool manager admitted he does not know what the trophy looks like and, along with most Europeans, paid little attention to the competition in his youth. That was in stark contrast to Alisson, Liverpool’s Brazilian goalkeeper, who has been captivated by the tournament from an early age.“It is a dream come true,” Alisson said. “When I was 14 my former club Internacional became Club World Cup champions in 2006 and I watched it as a supporter. I was so excited. Then I started to dream of this. Now I am here, with this big opportunity to win it for the first time with Liverpool against a big club.“It is big for Brazilians but I think it is bigger for who is playing in the game. If you are on the outside of this competition you don’t give it value. It is elite, it is just for the winners. It is important to make history and put our names in the club as the first time ever that Liverpool won it.”For Jorge Jesus’s team, motivation comes not only from the significance of the Club World Cup but the memory of the 10 academy players who died in a fire at Flamengo’s youth team training centre in February.The winger Éverton Ribeiro said: “The message to the families is may God be with them and we will dedicate this title to the players and their spirits. It’s a sad story in the history of Flamengo and it is a source of inspiration and motivation. We hope winning the title will bring comfort to the families of the deceased.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30a97bdf6f372162b2d92f76681504dbd6311129/59_20_3210_1926/master/3210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21446bc04cfefecc3ebf070d126631c7","title":"lionel messi guardian male world player 2019","story":"When Lionel Messi set off so did Diego Simeone, accompanying the run from the touchline. Drawn into what was unfolding before him, the inevitable conclusion edging closer, Simeone lurched and tensed and stuck his foot out as if willing his defenders to do the same until what he saw coming came. Messi bent the ball into the corner to score another late winner. The Atlético Madrid manager nodded, applauded and shrugged, arms outstretched, palms up, then clapped again: what ya gonna do? The following night Messi collected his sixth Ballon d’Or. “You deserve it,” last year’s winner Luka Modric said simply, handing it over.During Messi’s Ballon d’Or acceptance speech, he said the most significant thing he has ever said: he admitted retirement was near, time was running out. There was a desperation in the response that was eloquent, as if this was an idea too bleak to contemplate, the void too vast, but it had been said now and couldn’t be unsaid. He also said he was a “constructor”, not a goalscorer, which is true, but he has still scored more in the Champions League and La Liga than anyone, Golden Shoe winner for the sixth time, three in a row.But for what, people ask? What did Messi do? In the end, it was a disappointing year. Barcelona won only the league and reached the Champions League semi-final and the Copa del Rey final. Only.Messi has had many victims over the past 15 years, and one of them is him. Being a World Cup runner-up accredited Modric as the best being a World Cup runner-up is held against Messi, proof of failure. He was accused of being absent in May’s 4-0 defeat at Anfield – maybe they mean apart from the shot Alisson saved, the two that whizzed just past the post and the three clear chances made for Jordi Alba, Luis Suárez and Philippe Coutinho. In the Copa del Rey final, he scored one another, which would have been among the great final goals, hit the post.What did Messi do? He has played better than anyone else in 2019. Maybe he has played better than anyone else, full stop. And in the play, he is peerless. For all the tangibles, the astonishing stats, it’s not always tangible. A better measure of Messi might be sought in Simeone and reactions like his – in the men around Messi who comprehend him through competition. It might be sought less in what people said publicly, although there are some nice lines – a favourite is Jorge Sampaoli insisting that “comparing anyone to him is like comparing an average cop to Batman” – and more in what they did. Moments that are more spontaneous, more real.The day before Sampaoli’s Sevilla met Messi, one of his coaching staff privately admitted that preparation might prove pointless, “If he has one of those days”. The next day, he did, Sevilla’s president calling him an “extraterrestrial”. One of the most startling things about him is how often it is his day. When it’s not, it weighs even more heavily.That day in March, Messi got a standing ovation from the Betis fans. There had been a roar when he nutmegged one of their players. “There’s not much you can do against Messi,” striker Loren Morón said, yet Betis had won 4-3 at the Camp Nou four months earlier.“You have to plan for him,” says the Betis assistant manager, Eder Sarabia and the plan he outlines is profound. “In our case, the first part was to have the ball and press high,” he says. “You want Messi as far from your area and the ball as possible. It’s not just going past people, finishing he’s also the best assist provider in the world. He’s the best of all time and virtually every time. It’s incredible. It’s not only what he does, it’s what he’s thinking beforehand, how he is positioned, how he understands the play, makes others better.“On those days when you can’t stop him – and there are a lot of them – all you can do is admire him. The words that come out your mouth when he scores can’t be printed in the paper, but while you’re pissed off afterwards, you know it’s a privilege to compete with him. Like Pau, all of us will tell the story one day our entire lives, we’ll ‘boast’ about playing him. We’ll say: ‘We tried to stop him’ ... and most of the time we couldn’t.”Another opponent echoes the importance of preventing the ball even reaching Messi, closing pathways, shutting spaces, outlining personalised plans for him which aren’t repeated for other players. “The trouble is,” he says, echoing Ernesto Valverde’s suggestion that Messi spends the start of matches on a reconnaissance mission, mapping the game out, “Messi’s intelligent: he sees what you’re doing, where your priorities lie and, depending on that, goes inside seeking overloads, drops deep, heads to the wing. He’s also incredibly strong, extremely fast. You can’t knock him over: you hit him hard and you don’t put him off his stride. Physically he is brutal.“You handle him well and then, the one moment you don’t, he’s scored. So, there you see it.”Simeone may feel the same way it was late when Messi set off on that run two weeks ago. He was 50 yards from goal but the moment the ball reached him, Atlético’s manager could “smell” the danger and so could Messi. “Look at that goal,” Sarabia says. “Messi shapes the whole move he gives it to Suárez in a way that means he can only give it back as he does. It’s hard to stop him, whatever plans us coaches have. When Messi sets off, he already knows where he is going to score.”“With a goal like that all you can do is applaud,” Simeone said, and that was exactly what he did."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e1d2acbce4b527eb412ea9c085e4ba30bdbf1b2/0_169_3992_2394/master/3992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b83b9da7bff14f81074d1d65e597e49b","title":"mikel arteta effective mouthpiece arsenal","story":"The global success story that is the Premier League has had certain core drivers – money, slick marketing, talent, money, content, exposure, more money – and morphing from the monster have been particular phenomena. As Arsenal presented Mikel Arteta as their new manager on Friday evening, one of them felt particularly relevant. It is the personality cult of the manager.Manager of English clubs have long been at the heart of the business, the person who makes the big decisions on the all-important technical side, and he has always had to face the media. But as the league’s profile has entered a different stratosphere, so the demands on him to explain his choices and, very often, those of his club have ramped up.The English top-flight manager has become the de facto spokesman for the club because, very often, the executives prefer not to engage directly with the fans via the media and the arrangement is pronounced at Arsenal, where it is further heightened by the lack of access to the squad. When was the last time an Arsenal player was allowed to do an in-depth newspaper interview?It has left the Arsenal manager, very often, as the only employee who speaks in public, attempting to meet the insatiable demand for insight, and it is hoped that he does so with a degree of polish. Which is fine when Arsène Wenger is in situ but less so when it is Unai Emery, whose removal last month set the wheels in motion for Arteta’s appointment.Emery’s English was the subject of much mockery, which was unfair. The Spaniard did his level best to learn the language and, slowly, he was getting better. The issue, though, was his reluctance to engage with questions, whether in English or Spanish. Had he wanted to get his points across more lucidly in his native language via an interpreter – and there was one sitting alongside him throughout last season – it would have led to rejoicing among the press corps.He preferred the straight bat, the no comment, the general platitudes and, if it frequently led to confusion, the bottom line was that he came across as dull and boring. His media conferences were must-not-see events, numbers dwindled and the hard truth was that Arsenal slipped off the news agenda.Does this matter? At Wolves, for example, Nuno Espírito Santo is not noted for his loquaciousness in front of the media and yet he is loved by the fans and the club is upwardly mobile. Meanwhile nobody was complaining about Emery’s communication skills at the beginning of his Arsenal tenure when the team went on a 22-match unbeaten run. Results, plainly, are the primary determiner of a club’s mood.But, on a more micro level, yes, this does matter. If a big club is not relevant in news terms, it is no great leap to see that its visibility and prestige can be affected, together with the energy around the place the creative tensions. Players take their lead from the manager how he connects with them, motivates and fires the wider atmosphere at the club. An inspirational orator can set the right tone, driving a feel-good factor when results are good offering soothing assurance when they are not. Positive PR brings added edge.Arteta made the point during his unveiling that “every act is important,” every little detail and he made it clear that every small word could contribute to his overall goal, which is to lead Arsenal back into the Champions League and have them competing for trophies.It was a command performance from Arteta, the antidote to the tedium of Emery and, time and again, he returned to his key themes – the need to change the culture and collective mentality, which he plainly believes has been a problem for years to breathe positive energy into every pore of the club. In many respects he sounded like his friend and former Paris Saint-Germain teammate, Mauricio Pochettino, who has recently left Tottenham after overseeing a transformation of the club. Pochettino’s obsession with the concept of universal energy is well-documented.Arteta’s personality, and the force of it, was in full view as he moved from the TV cameras to a briefing with the written media, and there were moments of schmaltz when he talked of how it was a dream to be “back home,” the promise to “burn every drop of blood for this football club to make it better,” and how “it’s difficult to say no when Arsenal knocks on my door”.But it was the rallying cries that rang out the clarity of his vision and a certain ruthlessness, too, which those who know him say has always been a part of his make-up and he believes has been finessed by working under Pep Guardiola at Manchester City. To the players that buy into his methods, there will be possibility to those that do not, there will be the exit door. Arteta intends to lead by words and deeds to fashion a new identity out of the rubble of the Emery era and to win the trust of the players, who will then follow him.The mind went back to Emery’s media presentation at the Emirates Stadium in May 2018, which was an altogether more stilted affair. “We want to be protoganists,” Emery had said. Little else has stood the test of time.Arteta’s soundbites were deeper and more expansive from the heart and more natural. It was a performance that added up to a reference point, not only in his career but for his new players. Arteta knows Arsenal and the club’s issues, having felt them from the inside as a player and watched them from the outside at City. Have they lost their way? “That’s what I’m sensing,” he said at one point. How Arteta means to lead them to better times will be underscored by his charisma."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae2fc8c2fd294bbb6d87c42b0105a124d0939494/526_449_2493_1496/master/2493.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d37faf87b1dfa68e38c9bd90c68e502","title":"premier league fans half term reports arsenal liverpool","story":"Fans rate the best and worst of the season so far – the stars, the flops and what needs to change in 2020• Part two: Manchester City to WolvesOh for a return to the gloom of being bored by top-four finishes and regular trophies. It’s not just all those fans who filed out at half-time against Man City who are far too entitled: it seems that from top to bottom our club is populated by working stiffs who expect to be rewarded for showing up. Under the ownership of our absentee landlord the heart of our club has been eviscerated, replaced by an infectious apathy. It’s not just the poor results in our worst start to a season since the 70s, it’s the pitiful lack of spirit. 210Starsflops The unbridled enthusiasm of Gabby Martinelli has been just about the only highlight. Sadly the rest seem to have adopted the same uncommitted attitudes of David Luiz and Xhaka.Happy with the manager? I’m really not sure if Mikel Arteta is capable of commanding the levels of fear and respect needed to turn this sinking ship round. More’s the point, after Emery’s failure, I’m not sure if the suits who appointed Unai are suitable custodians of our club. I can’t ever envisage them appointing the sort of confrontational character we really need, for fear of rocking the business boat. 510Favourite moment of 2019? In a year where there’s been a dearth of gloating opportunities, seeing the former Gunner Serge Gnabry bag a four-goal haul in Spurs’ 2-7 humiliation against Bayern at White Hart Lane was special.It’s been as tough as expected. Some wonderful moments, but what we’ve seen has just confirmed that 17th would be a great outcome. Villa Park has been vibrant but the next few games are seminal. A poor Christmas could make it a sleepless early 2020, a good one would have us dreaming about cup finals. We’ll see. By the way, you get treated much worse as an away fan in the Premier League than in the Championship: no pubs for miles let you in and the “second class citizen” vibe is real. 710Starsflops Grealish has been superb, adding goals to his general wizardry. The only concern now is that we’re too reliant on him: if he gets injured we’re down. El Ghazi has exceeded hopes and McGinn started well but has been overplayed and has faded. I’m not in the “Wesley is useless” camp – he’s barely had a decent pass in a month. Mings is clearly a great bloke but his England debut went to his head. Grealish beware.Happy with the manager? 810. You gotta have faith. The last few weeks have been tough but we have to remember he is inexperienced. I’d follow him over a cliff but if we have a bad next six games he’s going to be under pressure. I’d definitely let him loose with the January chequebook, though.Moment of 2019? By a mile, Jack Grealish’s winner at St Andrew’s last March, and his “best day of my life” interview afterwards. The lad is a legend, living out most Brummies’ dreams.We’ve been, at best, mediocre. We started out with plenty of promise, but here we are in December, via a devastating injury crisis, in a relegation fight. The Carabao Cup defeat to Burton Albion set the tone and the team just haven’t defended well against long balls played over the top. 310Starsflops Jefferson Lerma, Aaron Ramsdale and on-loan Harry Wilson have impressed. Unfortunately, three players in good form isn’t enough to win games. The goalkeeping has been the biggest positive: Ramsdale has been outstanding. Less impressive have been Philip Billing, Dominic Solanke and Ryan Fraser: they need to give Callum Wilson service and they just haven’t been creating. We’ve always been among the top scorers but the attacking players are struggling now.Happy with the manager? Howe’s been making a few poor choices. Fans don’t understand why Simon Francis is getting games when his best years are behind him. Eddie has been unlucky – Lloyd Kelly injured before the start of the season, and David Brooks out until March – but the performances still haven’t been good enough. He’s pulled us out of stickier situations before, though, and we trust him to do it again. 510Moment of 2019? Beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge just tops our win at Southampton. Waiting for the VAR goal decision was nervy – but highly enjoyable when it went our way.A solid first-half of the season. We’re not winning enough, even though we’re so often the better team, but our new style is utterly convincing and we’re confident the results will come. We’ve just got to be patient. After 17 games last season we had one point more, but this term we’ve already met four of the top six away, and we played Palace off the park last time out. Just wish Zaha was on our team, not theirs. 710Starsflops Our midfield of Aaron Mooy – he gets everywhere – Davy Pröpper and Dale Stephens has been excellent, as have most of our summer signings: Trossard, Maupay and Webster. And Pascal Gross is thriving on our more positive approach. Flops are £5m Florin Andone, £15m Jürgen Locadia (both have gone out on loan) and £17m Alireza Jahanbakhsh, who will go on loan next month.Happy with the manager? Yes. Graham Potter has got us playing expansive, fun and exuberant football. He has instilled confidence in the players and the transformation has been staggering. We’re the Barça of the south coast. We achieved so much under Chris Hughton, but played to a tighter system. 810Moment of 2019? Given that totally unwarranted equaliser at Selhurst Park, I’ll go for a combined moment: beating the north London clubs: Tottenham at home, and Arsenal and Watford away.It’s been mixed. One real positive has been keeping six clean sheets, and we’ve had some good performances – but we seem further away than ever from getting to grips with the big clubs. We’ve had some big defeats against them, none more so than conceding five at Tottenham. 710Starsflops It’s always a team game with Burnley and that makes it hard to single people out. That said, the Ashley BarnesChris Wood partnership up front is special: they’ve continued where they left off last season and have already bagged 13 in the league between them. The emergence of Dwight McNeil has been a delight to watch. He’s started all but one of our league games since last Christmas. There’s nothing better than seeing one of your young players come through to establish his place. As for negatives – some players have struggled, but I wouldn’t label any of them flops.Happy with the manager? I fail to see how anyone can be anything but happy with a manager who has taken us into the Premier League twice and is now overseeing a fourth consecutive season there. That’s remarkable for a club like ours and the one fear we have is someone snatching him from us. 810Moment of 2019? That massively enjoyable week back in April when we beat Bournemouth and Cardiff to just about confirm our place in the top flight for this season.Fourth place, last 16 of the Champions League, academy players established in the starting XI – it’s been a cracking start to a new chapter. Yes, we’ve had a mini-slump lately but it’s a big learning curve. We all need to hang on tight through this period, but there’s plenty to be pleased about. 810Starsflops? Tammy Abraham has proved wrong all those who doubted his Premier League quality Mason Mount has been excellent – green at times, but that’s to be expected and Mateo Kovacic has been a revelation to me. He’s started to hit the net, too, which is a much-needed bonus. Reece James has been superb when he’s started and he’ll make the right-back spot his own. As for the biggest flop: it has to be anyone who’s been picked to play at left‑back. Azpilicueta, Alonso and Emerson have all been woeful at times.Happy with the manager? Very happy. He’s made mistakes, still isn’t on top of our defensive issues and seems a bit naive at times, but he’s new at this level. Unless we want to go back to a new manager every other season then we need to back him. His honesty in post-match interviews, win or lose, is refreshing. It’ll be very interesting to see who comes in to the squad in the next two windows, and how much input Lampard has in that process. 7.510Moment of 2019? Ajax away. Low expectations before the game, but we took it to them. Just brilliant.• Paul Baker In memory of Trizia FiorellinoTo be in the top 10 in the run-up to Christmas is a great achievement for a small squad. We gambled on having only one senior left- and right-back in the squad, and that’s come off the rails with the injuries in recent weeks, but we’ve kept on picking up results. Wins at Manchester United and West Ham, and beating Bournemouth at home despite having 10 men for most of the match have been the highlights. 710Starsflops Vicente Guaita has been superb between the sticks – a model of brilliant consistency. Wilfried Zaha has grown into the campaign, Gary Cahill slotted in seamlessly, Martin Kelly has been good all season, and Jordan Ayew has surprised everyone with his goals, dribbling, and energy. Max Meyer hasn’t established himself as fans expected him to, though made a big impact off the bench against Brighton, and it’s impossible to judge Victor Camarasa, as Roy Hodgson just hasn’t played him.Happy with the manager? Given the squad at his disposal, Roy has had a superb season. He’s even begun to make more positive substitutions. He’s spoken a lot about the need to strengthen in January if we are to compete for a top-10 finish and he deserves the chance to do so. 810Moment of 2019? In the final game of last season, Bournemouth fans were relentlessly baiting Zaha whenever he was near them. It made him so angry he promptly dribbled the entire length of the field to cross for Andros Townsend to finish. Perfect.What a disaster. Yes, we’ve been unlucky with a catastrophic injury list, but Marco Silva and the players were appalling. There’s a long-term stench of mediocrity around Goodison, with board and owners (past and present) having been prepared to accept second best for way too long. 310Starsflops There have been few obvious stars. Calvert-Lewin has grown in stature although isn’t proven as a natural scorer just yet. Mina has looked more comfortable and Holgate has proved adaptable. But Richarlison is the only player to deliver fully so far: he’s our outstanding player. Iwobi, meanwhile, needs to play as a No 10 otherwise he looks a poor buy. The rest have continually failed to show up.Happy with the manager? Silva (210) seemed a genuine guy and hard working, but was just hopelessly out of his depth in terms of his ability to focus players, instil passion and impose tactics and game management. Duncan Ferguson (6.510) gave us a welcome shot of passion, and reverted to a tried and tested 4-4-2, but was never a long-term fix due to his lack of experience. After that adrenaline rush we needed a cool head and some nous. Maybe Carlo Ancelotti can bring us that.Moment of 2019? Two moments from the Chelsea game: Duncan embracing the ballboy, and footage of the owner, chairman and CEO failing to clap in synchrony. Everton in a nutshell.We’re more than happy. I’d have snapped your hand off for a top-six place at the beginning of August and now we’re the only realistic challengers to Liverpool in the title race, if there is a title race to be had. On top of that we’re in a cup semi‑final, too. So it’s a very solid 1010.Starsflops Ricardo Pereira really doesn’t get the praise he deserves: he’s comfortably the best right-back in the Premier League. Jamie Vardy is putting his 2015‑16 form to shame, with 16 goals going into this weekend, and Wilfred Ndidi has made N’Golo Kanté look amateurish. On the flipside, Ayoze Pérez has had a frustrating start to his City career since he signed from Newcastle in July – he’s got quality but is really lacking consistency so far.Happy with the manager? Fans have adopted Wham’s festive classic, singing about giving their heart to Brendan Rodgers this Christmas. But even that doesn’t feel like enough, somehow. 1010.Moment of 2019? Every single time opposing fans have sung about Rebekah Vardy, Jamie has avenged his wife with a goal. Honestly, it’s like clockwork. Beautiful, hilarious, poetic clockwork.9.510. We’ve won every league game apart from one – a draw at Old Trafford – and are top by a distance with a game in hand. We negotiated a tricky start to the Champions League to finish top of the group and head back to Madrid in February. We’ve got a few injuries in defence, which is worrying, but even with Henderson as centre-back, in for Van Dijk, we still managed to win.Starsflops The star has to be VAR – that’s the reason we’re top, right? Other than that, the whole team, but if I have to single anyone out, Mané has been phenomenal. Also Adrián. He signed probably expecting to warm the bench plus an odd appearance in the cup but was called into action in the very first game when Alisson was injured. He has played 10 league games up to now – including a win over Everton. As for flops: all those pundits who insist we’re not playing that well. I’m looking forward to when we are. Oh and VAR, a truly dreadful introduction to the game.Happy with the manager? Completely, and thrilled he’s signed an extension to stay for years to come. Entertaining on the touchline, too: see his set-to with Monterrey’s Antonio Mohamed. 1010Moment of 2019? Winning the Champions League in Madrid. Followed by the triumphant bus tour around Liverpool the following day that saw Klopp on the swally being looked after by 19-year-old Rhian Brewster as he almost fell off the top deck.• Part two: Manchester City to Wolves"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9af5401dfa84d881308e64869bff6476065e1712/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=51ba727b6c2005670981f8f6af230f1c","title":"lego accused of muscling in on fans after bricklink takeover","story":"Sale has alarmed secondhand brick collectors but Danish toymaker claims it is about reconnecting with customers For 20 years the website BrickLink has been the best kept secret in Legoland, used by superfans to track down those elusive missing pieces and trade coveted minifigures for big profits.But last month online brickhead forums and blogs lit up after it was announced that the Danish toymaker had taken over the site, giving it a foothold in this lucrative secondhand market and a chance to see inside the heads of a passionate fanbase.The fallout from the deal, for an undisclosed sum, has seen Lego accused of “muscling in” on fan culture and concerns voiced that the ownership change will result in higher brick prices. With 600m listings, elements tend to be 10-20p cheaper on BrickLink than Lego’s own spares service.Adam White, editor of the Bricksfanz site, said fans’ reaction had been mostly negative. “It’s because BrickLink was an independent platform,” he explained. “Lego has its own part ordering service, but it sets the prices and the range is not as big. People are asking: are prices going to go up? I don’t think Lego is a big bad corporate but everyone thinks this is about cleaning up in the secondhand market.”But many adult Lego fans prefer free play, creating elaborate models (my own creation or MOC in Lego parlance] that belong on an episode of Lego Masters. They sell instructions for these unofficial sets, which range from an epic “Hogwarts diorama” to souped up Batmobiles. There are close to 20,000 MOC designs listed on BrickLink and fans fear this unauthorised creativity is vulnerable with “Big Brother” watching.But Lego, which sells £4bn worth of plastic bricks a year, has batted away such concerns. Owning BrickLink is about “strengthening” ties with its 1.1 million members not destroying them – not least given the company’s overarching goal of fostering creativity.Lego’s chief marketing officer, Julia Goldin, says the site will continue to run independently from its US base. “It has been a very effective marketplace, so you don’t want to interfere with that,” she explained. “We will always listen to fans. This is about getting much closer and understanding what the community needs in order to continue expanding and thriving.”Lego, which is controlled by the billionaire Kristiansen family, was forced into a major rethink in 2017 after suffering a rare slump in sales and profits. The Billund-based company confessed it had become too bureaucratic and its product development poor at a time when the toy industry is battling the internet for kids’ attention.The toymaker has been investing in “digital play experiences”, such as the Hidden Side series which combines its plastic bricks with an augmented reality app – effectively enabling children to bring their models to life. Recent toy sales suggest Lego is back on song, with Harry Potter-themed sets and a £160 Land Rover Defender kit among the most sought after toys this Christmas.Lego’s 2017 wake-up call may explain the company’s interest in a niche site like BrickLink which was started in 2000 by Dan Jezek (an AFOL who wanted to find others). In 2013 the site was sold to NXMH, a business owned by the Korean entrepreneur Jung-Ju ‘Jay’ Kim. The scale of transactions on the site is not known but over the years it has grown in stature, building a network of 10,000 sellers in 70 countries.The jury is still remains out though. “This is terrible news,” writes Peppermint_M, in a thread on the Eurobricks forum. “Nothing good can come of a monopoly on brick sources.” Another suggests it could spell restrictions for sellers and “might make many of them close their shops”.But Minifigforlife owner Andrew Watts, who has been selling on BrickLink for nearly 17 years, is sanguine about the deal. Yes it gives Lego a stake in the secondhand market, he says, but eBay and Facebook are far bigger markets for used bricks. He suggests the biggest prize is the treasure trove of data provided by the site’s passionate users – and also sees room for improvement because the site is hard for the uninitiated to use.“Secondhand sales to AFOLs will give Lego quality data about what sells and how often,” says Watts. “This information can improve its knowledge of what is popular and to perhaps bring back parts and themes that they had written off.”There have been skirmishes between Lego and the strident AFOL community before, Watts adds. In 2004 Lego tweaked the colour of grey and brown bricks to make them more appealing to the children: “To this date this has been the change that infuriated the community the most.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/626c34266d519efcba1d0f1e7eefd510297a3ba7/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e15c969c9a4ac28f6f71ec4bd218dd25","title":"blind date jonathan matt","story":"Jonathan, 26, content lead for education, meets Matt, 28, marketing officerWhat were you hoping for?The loss of my boxers at a yet undisclosed secondary location.First impressions?Oh Christ, he’s cute.

Dave arrives first. The south London rapper, 21, moved into the mainstream this year, winning the Mercury prize with his first album, Psychodrama, and making an explosive acting debut in Netflix’s Top Boy, as the thoroughly terrifying Modie. His sellout tour and Glastonbury show made news, too: remember the viral footage of the bucket-hatted kid who joined him on stage to rap on Thiago Silva (11m views)? Dave is cool and quiet, shaking everyone’s hand before taking himself off with his phone until Marcus Rashford appears.Rashford is a little late. Understandable, perhaps: it was Manchester United’s Christmas party last night, and he’s recently played vital, hard-fought games against Tottenham and City. But, despite being only 22, United and England’s young forward isn’t known for partying, and when he arrives he’s fresh and relaxed. Slighter than you might expect, and taller, he’s not flash, though his jeans have diamante sprinkled across the rips. He and Dave are months apart in age, but Rashford has a younger, less wary air. When he smiles, he looks like a kid.Dave is a huge United fan and Rashford likes his rap and grime, but at first both stick to their small entourages, check their clothes, worry about the photos. There is discussion of trainers: both have brought a brand new pair to wear. Dave’s are orange Air Max Rashford’s classic white Air Force 1s. They are both naturally shy, you realise, and deliberately low-key in the manner of those for whom fame is a side product of their job. Why attract attention when you get so much in everyday life?Rashford is coming up to the toughest part of his season. “December is hard,” he says, calmly. “We’ve got two matches this week.” Dave is not in work mode. Supposedly he went straight into the studio after winning his Mercury prize, but at the moment he’s happy to be out and about. And very happy to talk football. “It’s what I do my entire life when I’m not doing music,” he says. “If I’m in a hotel room in Sweden, or on a plane to Vancouver, I’m watching football. I’ll try to talk about other stuff, too, but football is a lifestyle.”Marcus Rashford What year were you born – 97?Dave 98. What were the big tunes at school that you can remember?MR Everyone was into Drake, Tinchy Stryder, Kano.D But Kano felt like he was more primary school than secondary school. I feel like 13 and 14 was Krept and Konan, Yungen and Cashtastic… I remember the dances, too. Do you dance?MR Nah, I don’t dance. When I was younger, I was either playing football, or when I was listening to music I was always on my bike. On my earphones.D I don’t dance, either. I remember people jerking and doing the Dougie – that was some American dance, the Dougie. Moving like you have a migraine. Your hands up here by your head. That was a real thing at school.MR There were a lot of underground artists I listened to. One of my brothers has a friend called Meena and if he was at my house seeing my brother, I was playing Fifa and they’d just rap all day. So I was around music.When did you start rapping?D When I was 14. It didn’t go well. I remember putting out a video and it got 41 views in the first day. And I’m going into class, and I’m thinking, “Rah, this is mad, I’m fucked, I only got 41 views.” But the positive of it was, “All right, I only got 41 views, so no one’s seen it.” Unfortunately, 30 of the 41 views must’ve been my classmates. So I could not live it down.There was a sort of chain in school. I wasn’t, like, mad at the top, but I wasn’t right at the bottom, either. I was a laughing stock. Walking past girls, they’re whispering, they’re laughing. You’re thinking, “Nah, I want to disappear, I never want to feel like this again.” I remember thinking, “Yeah, I’m retiring.”D Kaylum filmed it and I remember the video cost £40. That was everything I had. At 14, to amass £40! I was getting £2 a day for dinner money. The pasta in school was £1.60. I used to spend 50p to buy Skittles every morning, because I never had breakfast. So I’d always be 10p short for the pasta. Anyway, I remember thinking, “All right, cool, I’m going to miss dinners, put everything into this video”, and then that happened. So I retired.MR I’ve never picked up a mic – football was the focus. But the link between music and football is interesting for me, the two go hand in hand. We’d never play football without one of my friends bringing a speaker. Your upbringing definitely affects what music you like. A lot of people I know can relate to musicians because when they were younger they had nothing, same as me.D Music and football are two industries where black people excel, because talent is undeniable. You can’t deny an amazing voice. You can’t deny amazing athletic prowess. Physically, it’s evident. But in other industries, circumstance is more of a thing. Where you grew up, where you studied, the opportunities you got, where you’ve done work experience. When you’re talking about sport and entertainment at the highest level, you’re talking about an industry that grosses billions every year on a very select few people’s talent.MR For me, football brings people together. Where I grew up, I know the whole community from playing football in the park. I have the same friends from when I was six, seven years old. If some of my friends weren’t at the park, then they would have probably been getting into trouble. Football definitely helps communities, and you want to spread that message. Because I think sometimes people get caught up in, “Oh, he’s made it, he didn’t make it.” I don’t like to discuss that.D How do you feel when you walk on to the pitch?D Can you hear everything and everyone around you, or is it on mute?MR At first, when I played, it was mad. I remember looking at a section of the crowd and I must have seen about 10 or 15 people I knew. That’s when it hit me, in the first game, and I was like, “Wow, this is a bit weird – he lives there, he lives there, my mum lives five minutes away from him.” These things are going through my head. I needed to block it out and just focus on the game, and that’s what I did. And in that first game, honestly, I didn’t feel any fatigue, I was just running about on the pitch. When you lose yourself in the game, you always play your best football. You can hear the noise, you can feel the energy, but... Something’s there, but it’s not there. That’s the best way to approach it.D Is it different at home games?MR At home, if it’s positive energy, it drives you through your games. Your legs might not be there, but those games can be your best games, and it’s just because of the fans. If you played with no fans, there’s no way you’d be able to play 55, 60 games in a season. It’s not possible.D When I’m performing, the crowd just disappears, it’s like everyone merges – one big person. You just say the words and people will say the words back to you. And it’s just so rehearsed. I have a lot of songs I couldn’t forget the words if I tried. So you get in there, you lose yourself and it’s all good.MR So you don’t feel pressure?D Where I feel pressure in performance is when I’m being filmed and I’ve got to play and rap – I know if I drop a chord, I’ve dropped a song. If I’m playing a song on piano, if I miss a note I have to go back, because certain scales only make sense when you have the note before. So I have to bring the lyrics back. So everyone knows, yeah, he’s messed up.I did NPR’s Tiny Desk, this performance in America to a few people, and it’s the most nervous I’ve felt, because I can see the people who are judging me. When things are up close and personal, then you start to feel the pressure.MR No teammates to help.D Yeah. But I wouldn’t have it any other way. Because I know, if it’s a great show, it’s on me.How are you with your social media?MR There’s too much negativity. For me, you should only use your social channels to better the things around you. The rest of the time, I don’t look at it. If you go on Twitter, you’re going to see something bad, something good. You just don’t really need it.D I have to use it, because everything that I do is through social media. If I upload a video, I have to tell you: this video is up. I’m performing on stage here, blah blah blah. Certain times I’ll come off.I remember there was a period where I woke up and I saw something negative about myself on my social media every day for 91 days. And it doesn’t have to be mad negative – the smallest thing can ever so slightly change your day. But once you start to believe in yourself, you can start to tune everything out. Things affect you less. I’m sure it’s the same with footballers. I just know that, in the industry I’m in, I’m a trier. There’s people in the world that try, and there’s the people in the world that talk about the people that try.D Yeah, fast. For me, I think it was after Drake remixed my track Wanna Know. Though people still don’t know my face. You can’t watch football without seeing someone, but you can listen to music without seeing someone. I think Top Boy really changed that. When I was on tour in America, people would say, “Oh, you’re that actor!” Those two moments I felt a massive change.It’s funny, though, what you said about daily activities, how long they can become. Those are things I would still try to do. My manager’s always saying to me, “Why are you in Selfridges all the time?” I don’t even like shopping. But it’s the transaction of getting out of my car, walking and seeing people I don’t know. I think it’s important, even if it does take a long time, and even if you do have to smile and take a picture in this weird, awkward place, it’s important.I try to be outside often. When there were hard times and things were dark, when there were a lot of people I’d fallen out with, I was out every day, feeling the love, and sometimes the hate. When I walk around in LA, I’m less than nothing, and that is an invaluable feeling. It reminds you of the scale of what it is you’re trying to do.MR Manchester’s very, very small. I have quite a big family. I have two brothers, two sisters. So more often than not, somebody I’m speaking to knows my mum, or my nana, or my brother, or my brother’s friend, so everyone’s connected. Everyone’s family. But it’s the only place I can feel normal. If I didn’t go back to where I grew up and do normal stuff, see the same guy that used to serve me sweets when I was a kid, go and see my friend’s mum and dad, if I didn’t do those things, I’d be sat in my house.MR I think there’s a difference. It’s difficult, but you have to find what it is you’re talented at. I like to play basketball and stuff like that, but I’m not talented – it’s just a hobby. Do your hobby, enjoy it – but put your hard work and time into your talent.D I agree. I’ve played football my entire life, and I’m not a bad player, but it’s not moving me and my mum out of Streatham in this lifetime. But there was a point where Juss, who’s always with me and raps, and a few friends turned around and said: rap is something you’re good at. My friends helped me find that. But you gotta work mad hard at it.I remember being in college and girls would say: “Oh, he’s cool, but he doesn’t make the music that I would listen to, you wouldn’t hear him in a club.” It’s not my strongest point, singing or melody or rapping upbeat, uptempo, I’m not some crazy, hype, off-the-wall, flashy type of guy. But I learned quickly that collaboration and putting yourself out of your comfort zone, that’s the stuff that takes you further. Like going on Headie One’s track, or J Hus. You have to really push yourself. D I rate you so highly, not just in terms of football, but because I can see you take it seriously. I can look to you and say, “Wow, this is someone who’s got an opportunity and he’s running with it. He’s not coasting, he’s really going hard.” I love footballers – I see them out at a show or on holiday. But Marcus, I don’t see you anywhere. And that’s in itself a way of life.MR Well, as a player, you have to take yourself out of the emotion. It’s natural, if you’re a fan: if the team wins, they must have done well if they lose, they’ve done something wrong. But once you get caught up in that, as a player, you’re finished. It’s too up-and-down. You have to have a middle. If you win, it doesn’t mean you go crazy until the next game. If you lose, it doesn’t mean you sit moping. You have to find a balance, and you always go back to what you know.D So you don’t go mad when you lose?D Yeah, I’m going to vote.D When I look at politics, I think that everything is all just words. People say, “Oh, the problem that you have in your life is because of this person, so we’re going to take this person away, and your problem’s going to go.” It’s about ision, coming up to an election. And I think, as a person, what type of person could I sit in a room with? Ninety-nine per cent of politicians I probably couldn’t sit in a room with. If I feel like there’s someone I can relate to, then that’s the person I’m going to side with. Over the last three years, I feel like evil had a chance for the first time, overtly, not just in this country, but worldwide. People voted for some really dark, crazy stuff. So this might just be the world we live in. All you can do is try to make the world a better place.This might sound random, but seeing Cristiano Ronaldo when I was young, that did a lot for me. I used to watch Ronaldo videos every night before I went to sleep. Skills, compilations, shots, left-foot goals, all of this stuff. My life for a long time, even though it was nothing to do with football, was based around him. You can have that much impact, on someone who doesn’t even play sports.MR I’m sort of the same but with music: I need people to give me messages. There’s only certain people I can listen to leading up to games. I can’t listen to hype music because if I go on to the pitch pumped up with raw emotion, I’m going to get a red card. I listen to the same group of people. You, Stormzy. People who are spreading messages with the words.On the speaker, in the changing room, before a game, it’s pure hype music playing. I just sit down with my headphones. I need to be clear-minded on the pitch, because as a forward player you might not see the ball the whole game, just that one time. And the game could be 0-0. Now imagine it’s the Champions League final or the World Cup final…D Is it more pressure being a striker than a midfielder?MR You need a different mentality. I made my debut at 18. The beginning of that season was my first year as a striker, ever in my life. Before that I couldn’t understand how somebody can enjoy a game of football without touching a ball. Where you could have one chance and that’s it. I’ve always been a person who needs the ball – I need to express myself and make things happen.Then all of a sudden, a coach I liked changed my mindset. Then six months later, I made my debut with the first team. The bit I needed to work on was switching the mindset. That’s what I’ve improved on a lot, but I’m still so far off where I can be. Everyone can say I scored a few goals and I’m in good form – but it’s nothing to what I can achieve.D This new generation of footballers, I don’t think it’s ever been this expressive. The kids – I saw flair in everyone. So much competition, so much talent, and they’re all from similar age groups. This is an amazing time to be an English footballer.MR The first time I was ever nervous was England under-16s against Ireland away. I was taking kick-off and my knee was shaking, and this had never happened before. I didn’t play as well as I could have. Since then, the word pressure has changed for me. I see it as an opportunity. At the end of the day, if you take a penalty, the keeper can save it. I could have a perfect penalty, and the keeper could just save it: it’s out of my control. In football you can’t always control the outcome or results – it’s a team sport, and anything can happen at any moment. Why this generation is good is because that’s what everyone’s mindset is like. There are so many young players nobody knows right now, ready to come on to the scene. I’m trying to get them to understand how talented they are. Then if you work hard at it, don’t put a limit on how good you can become. Because England can definitely win something. We already know that, on our day, we can beat any team in the world – but we want to get to the level of what Germany was in 2014, and Spain for many years - that consistency. If we don’t win something with England, at the end of my career, I’d feel like something went wrong somewhere.• If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c28542b42bf797f068e0a45ca97377cc1d3676c9/0_141_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc2f0107634438447ac049443dd08031","title":"devoted to hanukkah and christmas hadley freeman","story":"A holiday that was once about maintaining one’s proud Jewish heritage has, in the minds of many, become Santa Claus with candlesAs you are obviously very aware, we are in the final countdown to the most exciting, glittery, delightful holiday of the year. Yes! I’m talking about Hanukah! Can I get a woop woop?Hanukah, which begins tomorrow night, is the only religious holiday I know of where the less observant you are, the larger it looms in your religious consciousness. Because, in truth, it’s a pretty minor holiday in the Jewish calendar. Yet with the pluck of a wildly ambitious reality TV star, it has pushed its way to the forefront of the Jewish holiday lineup. Among the non-chosen people, it might even be better known than Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Pesach, the Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett of the group, now overshadowed by Hanukah’s Rylan Clark-Neal.This is because (for reasons I will shortly get to) it is the favoured holiday of the assimilated Jew. But first allow me to play Hebrew school teacher for a moment while I tell you the story of Hanukah: according to the first and second book of the Maccabees (which FYI has nothing to do with The Maccabees), Hanukah celebrates a small group of Jews who refused to worship the gods of their Greek-Syrian oppressors and thus refused to assimilate. Alas for poor old Hanukah itself, however, it has, in a classic Jewish joke of a twist, become the most assimilated of the Jewish holidays because of its proximity to Christmas. So a holiday that was once about maintaining one’s proud Jewish heritage has, in the minds of many, become Santa Claus with candles. Hell, the Hallmark channel now even makes Hanukah-themed romcoms. (Who was it who said that those Zionists, even if they lived in this country for a very long time, don’t understand English irony? Because I’ve lived in this country for fricking ages and I am all over the irony here.)Assimilation has slightly tricky connotations these days. Like being a centrist, it was once touted as a sensible compromise but is now viewed as a problematic and self-defeating. And it goes further: urging immigrants or minorities to assimilate is now seen as tantamount to racism, a euphemistic way of shouting at foreigners on public transport to speak English, we’re in England, for fook’s sake.Yet the undeniable fact is that I am utterly assimilated. Nine years of Hebrew school means I know my way around the Hebrew alphabet. But I also have a collection of Christmas tchotchkes so extensive, they have their own storage box. Do you need at least four Santa snow globes? Or a selection of artfully decorated dreidls? Got you a woman who can do both.For most of my life I’ve had conflicted feelings about my assimilation, but the reasons have changed. Even though I grew up in New York (a city so Jewish Jesse Jackson once referred to it, charmingly, as “Hymietown”), my childhood social circle was remarkably unJewish. Next to my friends, who were mainly blond and spent summers at tennis camp, I saw myself as a semitic little freak, condemned to spend weekends in a dark synagogue with my dark hair, learning to write an ancient language no one I knew spoke. (And that includes my parents.)Although my mother dutifully took me to Hebrew school and ensured I was batmitzvahed, the reason I am so assimilated is because my parents are. My mother loves Pesach and Rosh Hashanah (nobody loves Yom Kippur), but she loves Christmas at least as much. If you think my Christmas tchotchke collection is extensive, you should see my mother’s after all, I only have her overspill.Once I started to make more Jewish friends, at university in the UK and as an adult in London, it was the “assimilated” part of my identity I began to resent, rather than the “Jewish” half. I envied friends who grew up with the undiluted version, who could lapse into Yiddish without a pause, who didn’t have to double-check whether you go to synagogue on the Friday or Saturday or both. How enviable to grow up with such a clear view of oneself, I’d think. I’d occasionally go to Jewish social centres where friendly people would talk to me in Hebrew and I’d have to say, “I don’t know what you’re saying but I can write it out phonetically? Does that count?”Anyway, I obviously didn’t want it that much, because I never did anything about it. I somehow kept neglecting to go to synagogue while at the same time finding time to get a Christmas tree every year. I even shacked up with a goy – oy vey! But when my kids were born, I was damned if they weren’t going to feel Jewish, and I immediately put them down for Hebrew school, even if I have yet to take them. So last weekend I was horrified when one of them announced, correctly, that he was “Christian and Jewish”.“You’re Jewish, because your mother is Jewish!” I hissed. He looked at me with all the condescension a four-year-old can muster: “It’s good, Mummy. It means we can celebrate Christmas and Hanukah.” And given I was hanging a star on our Christmas tree at the time, I could hardly argue. But it’s “Mommy”, not “Mummy”, kid, OK? There’s only so much assimilation that’s allowed around here. • Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/309a015d061a45b6ba1c6ed7004a0767b521db7a/1454_165_1464_878/master/1464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f74282039742bedb453efd3c4c712035","title":"mathew horne gavin and stacey actor piers morgan insomnia","story":"The actor on turning 41, Piers Morgan and insomniaBorn in Nottinghamshire, Mathew Horne, 41, studied drama at Manchester University.

Actually, the argument is the only traditional part - the purchase itself is usually a deeply unfestive transaction that I undertake in the presence of whichever of my children was unfortunate enough to cross my path that day, and whose only role is to approve my choice with the words, “Yeah, fine, whatever.”The dispute is about timing: I worry about buying a tree too early my wife’s anxieties revolve around leaving it too late. Saturday seems as good a day to start the argument as any.“Obviously this weekend is too soon,” I say. “But next weekend would be cutting it fine. I think Wednesday is probably our target.”“I’ve ordered a tree already,” she says. “It’s being delivered.”“Delivered?” I say.“It should be here by 11,” she says.At 11 the tree arrives. By 11.20 it’s standing in the sitting room with its lights on.“Nice, isn’t it?” my wife says.“Huh,” I say.I retreat to my shed. Four days of seasonal bickering have suddenly been excised from my schedule, and I am at a loss. I make a list of outstanding professional chores, and begin to ide them into obligations that must be discharged before Christmas, and jobs that might simply evaporate if ignored assiduously enough. My phone pings: it’s a text from my brother in America, which says simply: “Skype?”At first I think this might herald a family emergency, but I decide my brother, who has three small children, is probably casting across time zones in search of someone else who is awake.I take my laptop into the sitting room and call him. His pixellated face appears, flanked by the heads of two blond twins in pyjamas.“So we’ve been up for hours,” my brother says.“It’s nearly lunchtime here,” I say, “and all my children are still asleep.”“We’re four,” one of the twins says.“Yeah, we’re four,” the other one says. Their older brother leans in and pulls a face. The twins leave the frame. My brother catches me up on things, pausing frequently to issue weary admonishments.“It’s a struggle,” he says. “Anyway, we’re— Hey, don’t kick him!”“Did you get snow?” I say.“Here he comes,” my brother says, spinning his phone round to show my 98-year-old father entering the room with a cup of coffee in one hand. He steps over a prone twin and sits down in his chair. My brother’s phone closes in on my father’s face until it’s silhouetted against the bright windows behind.“I don’t speak before 11,” the silhouette says.“Does somebody need a timeout?” my brother shouts.“Are you talking to me?” I say.“I mean, there was some snow,” he says, turning the phone back to his own face. “But it wasn’t like… uh-oh.”The world spins, and I am offered juddering glimpses of my dad’s kitchen as my brother makes his way across it. A dog runs ahead of him. An open door revealing a child sitting on a toilet flashes past.The phone is deposited somewhere – possibly the fruit bowl – and I am left on my own with a view of a corner of the ceiling and the edge of a chair.“Hang on, I got ya, buddy!” my brother says, somewhere off camera. There is a brief silence. A twin’s head looms into view.“I’m John,” it says.“Hi John,” I say. “Are you…”A moment later the phone is snatched up. I catch a sideways view of the staircase before my brother sits down in the living room and offers me an establishing shot of the layout.“So we finally got a new couch for over there,” he says.“I’m not sure I remember the old one,” I say.“Hey!” he shouts. “You can’t fight in here!” He turns the phone back towards himself, leaning forward to rub his eyes. For a moment neither of us says anything.“Did you get a tree yet?” I say.“No,” he says. “That ain’t gonna happen today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d425922443f3ae4e1035e106dea54d5bf61a7834/2715_198_1582_950/master/1582.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0baa9d11de0a4ab0db06f75e62015ce7","title":"howd you like them apples how the science of sleep is helping british apple farmers thrive","story":"Apple author James Rich learns how British growers are using new technology to keep us in perfect pommes all year round Our love affair with them runs far deeper than the apple-a-day proverb further than just something to nourish and keep us healthy – although they are packed with vitamins A and C, magnesium and fibre.They represent fertility in some cultures, wealth and health in others, knowledge, and some of our most celebrated discoveries (hello, gravity). They have permeated culture history, religion, science and technology to be a familiar and reassuring constant in our everyday lives. Quite simply, the apple is more than just a fruit. In fact, Brits buy more than 34,500 tonnes of apples each year (roughly 2.2m apples a week) at Tesco alone.And British apples are some of the best. In the UK, we have the ideal climate and weather to grow perfect pommes. Not only do we have the perfect growing conditions, but our apple growers are some of the most advanced in the world the British apple industry pushes innovation, using the latest technology and equipment to ensure only the tastiest of fruits.Growers include the family owned Adrian Scripps in Kent, which has been specialising in growing “top fruit” (meaning apples and pears) in the garden of England since the 1960s – and has supplied Tesco for more than 30 years. Working with Adrian Scripps, Tesco became the first supermarket to sell British apples all year.Managing director James Simpson explains: “We grow British apples to fill the shelves all year round: gala, discovery, braeburn, kanzi, red prince, jazz …”But apples are a seasonal fruit eating apples especially have a growing season approximately eight-weeks long, generally in September and October. Still, we’ve grown to expect them in our fruit bowls all year round. How do we bridge the gap?Simpson explains that technological advancements mean that British apples can be kept fresh for as long as eight months from the time of picking – stored from September or October right through to May or even June.To do this, the fruit is housed in cold stores (think giant fridges) holding hundreds of tonnes of apples. Here, Simpson and his team can control the atmosphere that the apples are kept in, specifically the natural gases.“The air we breathe is predominantly oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen,” he explains. “By lowering the oxygen level in the air, we can slow down the ripening process that the apples would otherwise go through.“Reducing the oxygen levels, which will ripen the fruit, and increasing nitrogen, which slows down the ripening process, sends the apples in to a dormant state – a form of deep sleep.”This process, which sounds like something straight out of Snow White, is called dynamic controlled atmosphere – a natural process to safely store the fruit until they are ready to be eaten. Simpson likens it to the maturing of cheeses or wines.“The number one priority for us is the eating experience for our customers ensuring we keep the flavour and crisp bite in the apples is the major focus to growers – creating the tastiest, ripest British fruit,” Simpson adds.This also means rotating the varieties on offer. “We work with Tesco to ensure that only the best of the season’s apples are on their shelves at any one time,” says Simpson. “This will change depending on which apple varieties are at their peak at any given time moving from the discovery, which is a more delicate apple and has a shorter store life, early in the season, through to the braeburn, which is hardier and can be stored for longer, later in the season.”Ensuring optimum taste isn’t only about seasonality it’s also about meeting customers’ changing tastes. Tesco sells approximately 50 British apple varieties, introducing new varieties each year, which is where John Worth, Tesco’s master of apples (no less) comes in. Together, Worth and Simpson trial and introduce new varieties of apple – taking up to five years to perfect a flavour.“Right now, customers are looking for great flavour and juiciness, combined with a satisfying crunch as they bite into it,” says Worth on the latest apple created with Simpson. “This meant crossing crisp, modern varieties with the flavour of older varieties. Working with James and his team, the result was the red prince variety: its flavour and texture are enhanced as the natural sugars and acids mature in storage, resulting in a wonderful crispness.”Of course, we can still buy apples from all over the world, but with our expectation for local produce continuing to rise and the need to reduce our global food footprint being more vital than ever, homegrown champions such as Adrian Scripps are defining what shoppers want – filling our baskets with a British bounty of the all-important, and not-so-forbidden fruit.As well as supporting its suppliers in implementing new techniques to enhance freshness, Tesco has an in-house “sensory panel” to help growers across all its fresh food in developing new, flavoursome varieties that taste great and thrive in British climes.

A roll of the dice on the Monopoly board game takes you to the Community Chest card. It reads: “Bank error in your favour. Collect £200”. Older versions of the cards picture a bank teller mistakenly handing cash to a top-hatted gent, who looks both gleeful and astonished at his good fortune.In recent weeks we have revealed a much larger banking error, as £193,000 turned up in the account of a heavily indebted car mechanic in Cambridge. He was gleeful and astonished too in his words “I thought: ‘Whoa! Bloody hell, whoopee.”And who wouldn’t? Yes, lots of very decent people will instantly contact the bank, knowing the money isn’t their’s, and that they are not legally entitled to it. Lots more will think, hold on, maybe it is actually mine somehow … maybe the bank will never notice … and what about finders keepers … doesn’t that mean I can just keep it?There’s an important difference between failing to hand back £193,000 in your account, and directly stealing it from the bank. In religious teaching, the first is a sin of omission, the second is a sin of commission. They are both sins. But the Catholic altar boy in me tells me I’d be given rather fewer Hail Marys for omitting rather than committing.This business of money just landing in your account happens more than you think. I know of an accountant who saw £28,000 wrongly credited into the account of his son, an oil worker abroad, and the bank did not notice for 10 months. I know a shopkeeper whose business account was suddenly credited with heaps of small, inidual payments obviously intended for another business account. Both handed the money back … eventually.In each case, they knew the money wasn’t theirs. But they held on to it. I think we shut our eyes and imagine that the only loser is the bank, and they’re a rich, remote, corporate entity, not a real person.But if you found £193,000 in a suitcase you would behave differently. You would know full well it belongs to someone, and possibly someone very dodgy. And if you have ever seen the 1994 film Shallow Grave, you’d know to high-tail it to the police station immediately.Is poverty or debt a good reason to hold on to what is not yours? I’m humbled by the tale of Kevin Booth, a homeless man in a small town outside Seattle. This time last year, Booth was at the local food bank before it opened when he found a plastic bag full of $20 notes. He patiently waited to hand it in to the food bank when it opened. There was $17,000 (£13,000) in the bag.“I felt like doing the right thing would be better than taking off with it,” he said. “It made me feel good.” He had been living on the streets for seven years.Maybe some people think they can just get away with it. Two metal detectorists unearthed an astonishing hoard of Saxon and Celtic treasure in a Herefordshire field. They had not obtained permission from the land owner to search for treasure, and the law says they should have declared the find for the nation.Finders really is not keepers. They were recently sentenced, many would say harshly, to ten years and eight and a half years respectively. Goodness knows what Lord Elgin should have got for those marbles.If you have any residual doubts about “bank error in your favour”, consider the case of Sarah Jane Lee who in 2007 found £135,000 in her account. Unlike our car mechanic last week, she and her sister Amanda Moorcroft blew almost the lot, splashing out on a £10,000 Florida holiday and luxury items. Their bank, Abbey (now Santander) in Blackburn, didn’t spot the error for several weeks, but they did eventually catch them. They were charged with “retaining wrongful credit” and were sentenced to 12 months and 10 months respectively.There are lessons to be learned from the curious case of the man who made a tiny sort code error, lost £193,000, and the man who received the cash. The technical lesson is that banks have woefully failed to sort out “confirmation of payee”, which would have prevented the error occurring in the first place. The legal lesson is that you are not entitled to money wrongfully credited to your account. The life lesson is that, whatever mental gymnastics you may go through to somehow think the money is yours, it’s not, and it’s really not worth the hassle trying to keep it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec49ddc26e3d91d1f53c02c7866056c2a4b50ea0/0_258_4792_2875/master/4792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e4ae27416ea63b9f421db433f837cb2","title":"ladbaby i love sausage rolls christmas no 1","story":"Novelty duo become only the third artist ever to score back-to-back Christmas No 1 singles, after the Beatles and Spice GirlsLadBaby have scored their second Christmas No 1 in a row with I Love Sausage Rolls, a novelty song recorded to raise money for food banks.It makes LadBaby – British YouTube star Mark Hoyle and his wife Roxanne – only the third act ever to score back-to-back Christmas No 1s, following the Beatles, who topped the chart from 1963 to 1965, and the Spice Girls from 1996 to 1998.“I can’t believe we’ve done it again,” Mark said. “Thank you so much to everybody who downloaded the song … I’m honestly speechless. I’m out of sausage roll songs so I don’t know if we can do it again.”Using the melody to Joan Jett’s I Love Rock’n’Roll, the song is an ode to “a beige and savoury treat”, full of smutty double entendres and proud carnivorousness (“We’re not on a vegan diet  We know Quorn will never be a client”). It follows LadBaby’s 2018 No 1 We Built This City on Sausage Rolls, another pastry-themed hit sung to the tune of Starship’s 1985 hit We Built This City. I Love Sausage Rolls scored 93,000 chart sales (a figure combined from streams and downloads), 18,000 more than We Built This City in 2018.Proceeds from I Love Sausage Rolls are going to food bank charity The Trussell Trust. Chief executive Emma Revie told the  she was “so grateful” for LadBaby’s campaign: “The money raised will help us support our network of food banks to provide the best possible emergency help to people referred, while we work towards a future without the need for food banks.”Mark Hoyle, a graphic designer from Hemel Hempstead, first became famous for his candid YouTube diary videos documenting fatherhood and family life. As LadBaby, he and his family have 3.4m followers on Facebook, and in October signed a management deal with William Morris Entertainment and Margravine Management to help them branch out into merchandise, publishing and live events.Speaking to the , Mark Hoyle described visiting a food bank as “heartbreaking” and complained that the issue of food poverty had been overlooked for too long: “So much of the last few years has been dominated by Brexit and what’s happening with the government that so many issues – whether it be food banks or so many others – are taking a back seat because everyone’s focusing on that.”Stormzy’s single with Ed Sheeran and Burna Boy, Own It, is at No 2. The Croydon rapper was also kept off the top of the album chart, by Rod Stewart’s new release You’re in My Heart.Wham!’s Last Christmas reached the singles Top 10 for the fifth year running, but is still yet to top the chart – it was kept off No 1 by Band Aid’s Do They Know It’s Christmas? on its initial release in 1984, and also reached No 2 in 2017. Mariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas Is You, which finally topped the US chart this week 25 years after its first release, couldn’t repeat the success in the UK – it reached No 8. Thirteen other Christmas songs, by the likes of the Pogues, Shakin’ Stevens and Michael Bublé, are in the Top 40.Despite a passionate social media campaign and support from the singer himself, Jarvis Cocker’s 2006 song Running the World could only reach No 48. The campaign to get it to Christmas No 1 had begun in the wake of the Conservative party’s election victory – the expletive-laden lyrics are a diatribe against the ruling classes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbe59a902e9bfedc054bd5994dfb2305ad896a68/0_237_3337_2002/master/3337.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bbe5959e4115f342cbc82670f7acfc2","title":"ladbaby i love sausage rolls christmas no 1 charity food banks","story":"Singer says second consecutive Christmas No 1 charity single, released because ‘the country needs a laugh’, will benefit ‘everyday people’ forced to use food banksLadBaby’s I Love Sausage Rolls, a spoof of Joan Jett’s 1982 hit I Love Rock’n’Roll, has beaten Stormzy’s Own It to the festive top spot. It is the second Christmas No 1 for YouTube stars Mark and Roxanne Hoyle in two years, putting them in gilded company: the only other acts to rack up consecutive Christmas No 1 singles are the Beatles (1963 to 1965) and the Spice Girls (1996 to 1998). With 85,000 digital purchases, is also the fastest-selling download since the Artists for Grenfell cover of Bridge Over Troubled Water in June 2017.The young parents became famous through sharing irreverent videos about raising their two infant sons and now command an audience of 3.4m Facebook fans and 766,000 YouTube subscribers. In 2018, they pipped Ariana Grande and Ava Max to the Christmas No 1 with We Built This City on Sausage Rolls, a riff on Starship’s 1985 single.This year’s LadBaby campaign drew support from Stormzy, who described their mission as a “beautiful thing”, and Scottish musician Lewis Capaldi, who posted a characteristically unfiltered video of himself dancing topless to the song. Alan Merrill, who wrote and released the original song with his group the Arrows in 1975, said: “When I wrote it back then I could never have imagined this!”The proceeds from both singles benefit the Trussell Trust, a charity that supports more than 1,200 food banks in the UK. The money from last year’s single provided 70,000 three-day emergency food parcels. More than 823,000 parcels were distributed through food banks between March and September 2019, the busiest period on record.Emma Revie, chief executive at the Trussell Trust, said the charity was “so grateful” for the support: “The money raised will help us support our network of food banks to provide the best possible emergency help to people referred, while we work towards a future without the need for food banks.”The Hoyles recently visited a food bank and were surprised by the constant stream of people coming through the centre’s door. “It wasn’t always people that were destitute – it was everyday people, and that was quite shocking,” said Hoyle. “A window cleaner said that he had fallen off a ladder and broken his leg, which had led him to be there. We read so much about the problem but it’s different when you actually see it. It’s so much more heartbreaking.“There was a woman who came in with a little baby, probably about as old as ours, and when she left, the guy said, ‘It’s her 21st birthday tomorrow.’ How are we in this position where there’s a girl who’s 21 is going to a food bank because she can’t get food for her baby?”LadBaby released I Love Sausage Rolls the day after the UK election. Said Hoyle: “We were really worried about whether it would get lost in what was going on but I think the country needed something to have a bit of a laugh about. However people felt about the government, this song hopefully gave them a reason to laugh and a reason to donate to the people who needed it most.”Of the new Conservative administration, Hoyle said: “I’m sure they’re gonna do a great job.” Pressed on whether a government that introduced austerity would do anything to mitigate the issue of food poverty, he said that the nation had to have faith that “the right people” had been voted in. He declined to state who he had voted for, but clarified that he had voted, and that it was important to do so.LadBaby’s aim with the single, said Hoyle, was to offer a break from politics. “So much of the last few years has been dominated by Brexit and what’s happening with the government that so many issues – whether it be food banks or so many others – are taking a back seat. We didn’t want to involve politics at all, we wanted to focus on the people who can’t eat.”Hoyle was equally non-partisan on the matter of who makes the best sausage rolls, and said his sole requirement was that they were served hot. Although perhaps not vegan: I Love Sausage Rolls makes one explicit, if unexpected political point on the matter of the meat-free pastry snacks that have proven a sales winner for Greggs this year. The Hoyles sing: “We don’t want to start a riot  We’re not on a vegan diet  We know Quorn will never be a client.”Hoyle said: “When we spent some time with the Trussell Trust, we learned that the only thing people really get a choice in is allergies. They don’t have the luxury of saying whether they’re a vegan or a vegetarian – they just get what people have donated during that week. It’s a luxury to be in that position where you can choose.”Hoyle said the family was looking for more ways to help the Trussell Trust throughout the year. “We don’t want Christmas to be the one time when we help out. Summer is a really important time for them – that’s when their food banks are really depleted because there’s no school. Children don’t have free school meals and a lot of parents have to rely on food banks.”The Trussell Trust’s Emma Revie argued that a more robust benefits system was needed to reduce food bank reliance. “Poverty acts like a current, with big structural things – like the rising cost of living or insecure work – sweeping people away and leaving them without enough money for the basics. But this isn’t inevitable. We know what things will anchor people against those tides and reduce the need for food banks: a benefits system that provides sufficient money and support to anyone who needs its help, work that is secure and pays fairly and emergency support from local authorities that fills the gaps when someone is hit by something unexpected.”In October, LadBaby signed with William Morris Entertainment and Margravine Management to represent them across all areas of their business and expand their platform across licensing, merchandising, literary and live events, Variety reported. Hoyle said they had no specific plans as of yet. “I like to be places we’re not expected. I don’t know what else is next. I’ll pick up the phone to anything, so as long as it’s funny and we can make people laugh and spread a positive vibe, we’ll keep doing it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45c6bed173206f779ed3e659b1c5f439e658e319/0_248_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ea42335f611e5aa9b29dc0858a805af","title":"inside the mind of scientist james lovelock","story":"James Lovelock, who turned 100 this year, discusses his life’s work, including his latest theory that AI might be the key to saving the planet.

But half an hour into the flight, Boeing reported that the capsule had not got into the position needed to get to the International Space Station.Officials stressed the capsule was in a safe and stable orbit. The Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine tweeted that the capsule burned up more fuel than planned and controllers were using its thrusters to raise its orbit.With less fuel on board, it put the rest of the flight in jeopardy. The Starliner was supposed to reach the space station on Saturday and remain for a week.Thousands of spectators gathered to witness Starliner’s premiere flight. The United Launch Alliance rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and was visible for at least five minutes, its white contrail a brilliant contrast against the dark sky. The mood quickly turned somber as news of the setback trickled out. Nasa officials deferred to Boeing for updates.“Safe and stable is the important thing right now,” Boeing spokeswoman Kelly Kaplan told reporters.This was Boeing’s chance to catch up with SpaceX, Nasa’s other commercial crew provider, which successfully completed a similar demonstration last March. SpaceX has one last hurdle – a launch abort test – before carrying two Nasa astronauts in its Dragon capsule, possibly by spring.A successful Starliner demo could have seen Boeing launching astronauts by the summer. But that might not be possible now.The US needs companies competing like this, Bridenstine said, to drive down launch costs, boost innovation and open space up to more people. He stressed the need for more than one company in case of problems that kept one grounded.The space agency handed over station deliveries to private businesses, first cargo and then crews, in order to focus on getting astronauts back to the moon and to Mars.Commercial cargo ships took flight in 2012, starting with SpaceX. Crew capsules were more complicated to design and build, and parachute and other technical problems pushed the first launches from 2017 to 2020. Last April, a SpaceX crew capsule exploded during a ground test.It has been nearly nine years since Nasa astronauts launched from the US. The last time was 8 July 2011, when Atlantis – now on display at the Kennedy Space Center – made the final space shuttle flight.Since then, Nasa astronauts have travelled to and from the space station via Kazakhstan, courtesy of the Russian Space Agency. The Soyuz rides cost Nasa up to $86m each time.Chris Ferguson commanded that last shuttle mission. Now a test pilot astronaut for Boeing and one of the Starliner’s key developers, he is assigned to the first Starliner crew with Nasa’s Mike Fincke and Nicole Mann. All three were at control centres to watch the launch.Built to accommodate seven people, the white capsule with black and blue trim will typically carry four or five. It’s 16.5ft (5m) tall with its attached service module and 15ft (4.5 metres) in diameter.For the test flight, the Starliner carried Christmas treats and presents for the six space station residents, hundreds of tree seeds similar to those that flew to the moon on Apollo 14, the original air travel ID card belonging to Boeing’s founder and a mannequin named Rosie in the commander’s seat.The test dummy – named after the bicep-flexing riveter of the second world war – wore a red polka dot hair bandanna just like the original Rosie, and Boeing’s custom royal blue spacesuit.The flight was designed to test all systems, from the vibrations and stresses of liftoff to the 28 December touchdown at the Army’s White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, with parachutes and air bags to soften the landing. Even the test dummy is packed with sensors.On the eve of the flight, Bridenstine said he was “very comfortable“ with Boeing, despite the prolonged grounding of the company’s 737 Max jets. The spacecraft and aircraft sides of the company are different, he noted. Boeing has long been involved in Nasa’s human spacecraft programme, from Project Mercury to the shuttle and station programmes.Boeing began preliminary work on the Starliner in 2010, a year before Atlantis flew for the last time.In 2014, Boeing and SpaceX made the final cut. Boeing got more than $4bn to develop and fly the Starliner, while SpaceX got $2.6bn for a crew-version of its Dragon cargo ship.Nasa wants to make sure every reasonable precaution is taken with the capsules, designed to be safer than the old shuttles.“We’re talking about human spaceflight,” Bridenstine cautioned. “It’s not for the faint of heart. It never has been, and it’s never going to be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a1d6b2d6200eae370ea7a39b371acf68859b921/9_15_1276_766/master/1276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df06c782e59bac8f509c082a7996633a","title":"guardian and observer charity telethon call our writers to donate","story":"Katharine Viner, Owen Jones and George Monbiot will be among those picking up the phonesWant to talk about the climate crisis with George Monbiot or discuss tumultuous recent political events with Polly Toynbee, Owen Jones or Marina Hyde?

She alleged that Dr Larry Nassar had sexually assaulted her more than a decade earlier when she’d been his patient – and in doing so, Denhollander became the first of more than 265 women to come forward alleging abuse by Nassar.Nassar will spend the rest of his life in prison after being convicted on charges of child pornography, sexual assault and sexual assault of minors. During a January 2018 sentencing, dozens of his victims gave impact statements in court in Michigan, facing their accuser with an array of emotions. Denollander was one of them, asking simply: “How much is a little girl worth?”By that point, Denhollander was already one of the most vocal and best-known of Nassar’s victims a lawyer, she’s moved into advocacy work full-time since coming forward three years ago. Denhollander’s work has expanded beyond the world of sports, though, and she’s been especially critical of the Southern Baptist Convention and the abuse within its ranks.This week Denhollander spoke with the  about her ongoing advocacy work and the progress she hopes to still see.It’s been more than three years now since you came forward and this movement started.

They have refused to identify even one thing that went wrong. They have refused to identify even one coach that was abusive or one abusive situation, to point to something and say, hey, we shouldn’t have allowed that. And if you cannot even acknowledge the problem, you cannot fix the problem.And I take it you don’t feel like that has happened.They really still do believe they have a publicity problem. That’s what they’re acting like. … So it has been nothing but gross disappointment.When it comes to the tension between policy v communication, did you always feel that communication trumped policy?Do you think, then, that there’s a misconception among the general public that this is more of a policy problem than anything else?In terms of the organizations themselves… they really do believe that these are largely publicity problems. There’s just no understanding of trauma, of emotional abuse, verbal abuse, psychological abuse. It’s just it’s not there. The framework for understanding abuse is completely gone. But those who are in authority are intentionally not educating themselves. And chosen ignorance is the greatest form of cowardice.Do you feel like that lack of action and understanding has created a situation where more abuse could still occur?How much worse can it get? If this wasn’t enough, what is it going to take? I do not have any hope for those who are in leadership at USAG. I don’t have any hope for the vast majority of elite coaches who were participated in the system, who knew what was going on, who put their girls through this… and didn’t say anything. They have chosen over and over and over again an abusive framework. They’ve made that choice repeatedly. They’re not standing up and speaking out against it now. The athletes still to this day are left standing alone.Why do you think coaches and others within leadership have come to believe that the abusive framework they employed is the only way to win or succeed?It’s the lazy way out. You create a bunch of little girls that you can control and manipulate, who behave and perform like robots. It makes your job a whole lot easier.I know you and others work hard to keep this story in the news. What concrete goals do you hope to achieve even as USA Gymnastics seems to refuse to make real change?Switching gears, can you take yourself back, mentally, to when you decided to speak out and realized that advocacy work could be a future. How does the reality of what that life has been like over the past few years compare with what you imagined?In terms of the life shifts for me and the doors that have opened, I did not anticipate that. That has been a whirlwind. I’m deeply grateful for that. I am, but I wish it wasn’t necessary.In terms of the difficulties involved with you role, what’s been the hardest to deal with?My own story is still very difficult. I never wanted my sexual assault to be dinner-table conversation across the world. And just the level of graphic detail that’s out there, the photographs, the videos – I still find it very re-victimizing and very difficult.Your advocacy work has expanded far beyond the world of gymnastics and far beyond sports, even. How did you decide to take on that role, and why was it important to you?Looking back over the past few years, is there one moment or piece of work you’ve done that you’ve found the most fulfilling, or that you find yourself returning to when the going is tough?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91618cc76f3a7f7974f59402fe78d5db14d3b311/0_277_2361_1416/master/2361.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbcd4d48fc4c36ad9b6f5d812d7d66ef","title":"my blueprint for 2020 ugo monye six nations","story":"Rugby has much to build on after a thrilling year but clarity on calendars and wages is needed plus more attacking gameplansAt the very top of my agenda for the new year is a commitment to everyone involved in the game in this country to build on the excellent work done by England at the World Cup. We saw a spike in terms of welcoming more people into the game after 2003 but what I really want to see is a greater ersity of people coming into rugby. I’ve said it plenty of times before because it is something I’m really passionate about but a third of the England squad in Japan were from BAME backgrounds. On the back of that I would love to see rugby grow and develop in areas such as inner cities as well as the traditional heartlands.Law amendments. Where to start … if I were to make just one change it would be in an effort to reduce the amount of time wasted over reset scrums. During Exeter’s win over Sale last weekend it took four and a half minutes for one scrum to be completed. Stopping the clock could help but I also think that taking away the option of selecting another scrum from a free-kick could make a difference. Caterpillar rucks can also go too – no league likes to box-kick more than the Premiership and it is having an adverse effect.Surely now is the perfect time to bring a greater transparency to the Premiership salary cap. I appreciate that a review of the regulations was recently announced but there is still a 103-page document sitting in Premiership Rugby’s offices and it is not publicly available. As far as I’m concerned, Saracens’ breach happened, they have been punished and it is time to move forward and the best way to do that for all the clubs is with as much transparency as possible. We often say it is a game for the fans but sometimes I wonder if they are given the full picture.When England return to Japan for a two-Test tour in the summer it will be with an unfamiliar squad. There is every chance that not a single player involved in the World Cup will be involved. That presents Eddie Jones and a lot of players with an opportunity but the one thing I do not want to see is wasted caps. I look to the 2017 tour of Argentina when so many players were away with the Lions and some of that squad have just disappeared. Will Collier has not been seen for England since, nor Jack Maunder, and Denny Solomona has been in and out. A lot of the responsibility lies with the player – if you are given an opportunity you have to take it – but Jones must also avoid wasting caps and, if he picks players who are not contributing to England over this four-year cycle, then it is a waste.In the coming months we have a fascinating Six Nations to look forward to with so many new coaches involved, followed by the business end of the club season. In each competition I want to see attacking rugby prevail. I wouldn’t begrudge Wales their 2019 grand slam – Shaun Edwards has always said that defence wins championships and he is so often right – but they had the second worst attack in the tournament. During the pool stages at the World Cup it was all about Japan and the speed and style with which they were playing. But then in the knockout rounds it was pragmatism and defence. At the moment I’m loving watching Racing 92 and Leinster in the Champions Cup, Bristol and Northampton in the Premiership. It is often the case that a winning team provides the blueprint for many others to copy. In 2019 one would have to say that was Wales and South Africa but next year I hope it’s a team that favours an attacking brand that sets the example.Changes are clearly afoot when it comes to the global calendar – CVC have spent an awful lot of money for a seat at the top table – and some improvements can undoubtedly be made. It’s incredibly tough, like trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube with one hand, but let’s put the players front and centre. Players always want to know what is going on in the future. I think we’re moving towards a British and Irish league as well as a world club cup and that would have connotations for a revamped, perhaps streamlined, Champions Cup. If all the stakeholders can get together and iron out a global calendar that has the players at heart, perhaps by introducing a Christmas break, then rugby will be the better for it. In that calendar we need to build on the success stories of the World Cup. Japan simply have to join either the Six Nations or the Rugby Championship but there also needs to be a way for teams like Georgia and Fiji to have year-round access to matches against the top 10 teams in the world. And let’s do away with the term “tier-two” for good.One particular incident at the World Cup showed that referees are coming more and more into the spotlight: Jaco Peyper’s misguided photo where he imitated the elbow by Sébastien Vahaamahina that earned him a red card against Wales. They are in the spotlight more because, on top of everything, they are in effect broadcasters as well. Everything they say is broadcast on TV and inevitably they are scrutinised more. Supporters will always want to hear more, know more and get greater insight but my concern is that it has gone too far. In commentary I have a button – we call it the lazy button – and I can use it to talk to a producer or a director to ask for replays and I can have that conversation without it being broadcast. I think TMOs need that same button so they can speak to the referee and say: “For the last couple of minutes everyone has been offside – you might just want to have a look at that.” I don’t think we see as many interventions from TMOs because every word is broadcast and it is becoming counterintuitive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c66e49aea96d5bd088d998e05bbb2373674ce9ad/0_122_5412_3247/master/5412.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfa199888f9a59b3fce33762d5b2d335","title":"talking horses bank on countister betfair hurdle ascot horse racing tips","story":"The selection was only seventh in the Greatwood Hurdle last month but Nicky Henderson’s runners have been improving for a run“Improved for a run” has been a common theme for Nicky Henderson’s winners in the last month or so and the phrase may be heard again after Countister (3.35) lines up in the Betfair Exchange Trophy, the valuable handicap hurdle that closes Ascot’s Christmas card. She was only seventh in the Greatwood last month but two places in front of her was her stablemate Dame De Compagnie, who improved by about a stone to score last weekend.Countister, who also carries the colours of JP McManus, put up a remarkable effort to be third in the County Hurdle in March, her first run for a full year. This is a hot race but she should be able to get involved.The progressive Quoi De Neuf is feared most. Whoshotthesheriff was given a very attacking ride and then tired into second last time. He can win a good prize but this softer ground may not help. It is also a worry for French Crusader, beaten by only the classy Epatante last time.1.50 Ascot A 33-1 winner at this track on Friday is among the recent signs that Ben Pauling’s yard is on its way back. His Delire D’Estruval is on a very fair mark if ready for this on his seasonal return. He beat Midnight Shadow and Dynamite Dollars in a level-weights novice hurdle two years ago, showing potential to be worth a much higher rating than he has now.2.25 Ascot It was a revelation when Paisley Park won this last year but there is no excuse for missing him this time. He is officially a stone better than each of his five rivals and only Papagana could be called unexposed, so this will very probably be his seventh success in a row.2.40 Haydock Crosspark is the best of these and his yard is in form but whether he wants such testing ground is in doubt, especially with so much weight to carry. The veteran Top Wood put up a career best on his reappearance and a similar effort might be enough. Lord Du Mesnil is feared from the foot of the weights.3.00 Ascot Though disappointing on returning to action, Jerrysback surely needed that run and can show something closer to his best with Barry Geraghty back aboard. He looks nicely weighted on a couple of his novice efforts and his bravery cannot be faulted in light of his tired third place in the attritional National Hunt Chase.3.15 Haydock Nothing has gone right for Poetic Rhythm since he became Fergal O’Brien’s first Grade One winner in the Challow a couple of years back but this handicap hurdle might set him back on the right path. He was treated for a kissing spine after an abortive chasing campaign last winter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b86ba68cf8d664e456fee6d4e18ce675933a3815/0_34_1154_692/master/1154.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e20086d1d6bae17e91af3cb8fcd4d6da","title":"youtube highest earner eight year old guan ryans world","story":"Gaun’s online video channel, Ryan’s World, has 23 million subscribers and raked in $26m last yearAn eight-year-old YouTube presenter has topped its list of high earners, making $26m last year.Ryan Kaji (real name Gaun) made his toy review empire unboxing toys on YouTube from when he was just three.

But as we journeyed through the country I was taken aback by the vast and ethereal landscapes. And at 19th-century Stonefield Castle, with sweeping turrets and elegant well-tended gardens, near the lovely fishing village of Tarbert, my Scottish love affair began. Delicious seafood from the neighbouring Loch Fyne and glasses of malbec consumed over scrabble in the library made the weekend even more magical.

In particular, Lagoa do Fogo on São Miguel stands out as being one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. I was surprised that the islands are still quiet and unspoilt by mass tourism. JuliaOn a recent trip to Étretat we found the most special maison d’hôtes, Castel de la Terrasse. Estelle, the owner, gave us warm welcome and showed us to our perfect chambre, French Line. Our view over the roof tops to the bay with its chalk needles and back across rolling hills was sublime. Everything was gorgeous, including our locally sourced organic breakfast, served in the ornate dining room by Bernadette. The location of the Castel is ideal for exploring the dramatic Côte d’Albatre, and the town, loved by impressionist artists Monet and Pissaro, and by le grand écrivan Guy de Maupassant, for its beauty.• Doubles from €135 B\u0026ampB, casteldelaterasseGay ApplebyIn September I walked the celebrated route to Pulpit Rock (after a ferry and bus from Stavanger). But on local advice, the next day I turned left after the zipline (from the same starting point as the Pulpit Rock walk), through trampled undergrowth and past a stop sign. Then the markings for the hike up 718-metre Moslifjellet show themselves. I found the quietness and proximity to wilderness a fantastic shock and was suddenly aware of all the unfamiliar wildlife around me. The summit provides spectacular views of the archipelago and fjords. • visitnorway Richard Matousek As the crow flies, the UK’s most northeasterly point of Duncansby Head, in Caithness, is closer to Oslo than London. A short walk south from the lighthouse car park reveals dramatic cliffs overlooking a group of jagged sea stacks. Stake out the aurora borealis in winter and look out for seal pups camouflaged on the shores below. The Stacks Bistro at John O’Groats, which bakes cakes and biscuits everyday, is a popular choice for warming up afterwards.Susan BarrieIt’s bliss at the top of Monte Stivo. A cold beer and a soup spiced with cumin welcomes hikers at Rifugio Prospero Marchetti. Most people drive half way up but we chose the hard route. Step one: leave your bikes with the friendly man at the convent at Bolognano. Step two: struggle through a few “marked” trails overgrown with chestnut trees. Step three: Resist the temptation to hug the Bernese dogs at Malga Zanga donkey sanctuary and push above the treeline. The reward is a wonderful refuge, not to mention sweeping views of Lake Garda, the dagger-like Piccole Dolomites, and the snow-dashed Brenta peaks.Joseph FrancisAn interesting find, on a weekend in Thorpe Bay was a shack on the pebble beach itself, going towards Southend. It is a restaurant called Billy Hundreds built on the beach. It has big windows so there are great views. Apparently the owner’s grandfather used to be a Billingsgate fish porter, his badge was Billy 100. It is very popular, has a limited amount of seating and tables are rather packed in, but we had an excellent lunch and a bottle of wine. The most expensive dish on the menu – mostly consisting of seafood – is rum-battered sea bass at £6.95.• billyhundredsPaulineA friendly, shabby-chic village that impresses without forcing itself on you, Saint-Nectaire has a spa, grottos, a stained glass-windowed 12th-century church, waterfalls, trails and chateaux. Lac Chambon, in the crater of a volcano last active 8,000 years ago, is crystal clear and has sandy beaches hills and snow-capped peaks reflected as volcanic statues. You can rent electric bikes to tackle them. All great. Theres also the semisoft Saint-Nectaire cheese. Beautiful. Try a fondue and make sure you take some chunks for a trek up the local peaks. We thought Le Cave du Terroir (on Route de Saillant, no website) meant “Terror Cave”, and almost didn’t pop in. Turns out it’s a fantastic artisan cheesemaker.AntonyA short train ride from pretty Riga, Sigulda famous for its walking stick workshop (there are many quirky sculptures of walking sticks dotted around), the houses are out of a fairytale, and the area is dotted with castles standing out against the backdrop of forest. There’s a great walking trail out of the town and across a gushing river to woods, caves and abandoned buildings. You can ride across on a cable car, but save this as a treat for the end after a day’s hiking.

They will be joined by the likes of AJ Tracey, Lewis Capaldi and Mabel, who’s appearing for the third year running. But will any of them have bagged the coveted Christmas No 1? Christmas Day, 11.35am, BBC OneStrictly Come Dancing Christmas SpecialDebbie McGee, Chizzy Akudolu, Gemma Atkinson, Joe Sugg, Mark Wright and Richard Arnold re-sequin themselves for a one-off return.

Christmas Day, 4.40pm, BBC OneThe Great Christmas Bake OffFestive Bake OffThe judges reconvene for two specials: one with contestants from 2017 and 2018, which should be good the other with the cast of Derry Girls, which should be unmissable. Christmas Day, 7.10pm New Year’s Day, 7.40pm, Channel 4Dolly Parton: Here I AmThe queen of country has a podcast and a Netflix series, but this documentary gets us close to the real Dolly. Turns out she was there in her lyrics all along. Christmas Day, 8.30pm, BBC TwoJamie and Jimmy’s Festive FeastIs Taron Egerton a rocket man, or does he prefer baby spinach? All will be revealed as the actor joins food-mile-focused banter bros Oliver and Doherty at the end of Southend Pier to prepare apparently the first Christmas dinner he has ever cooked. Christmas Day, 8.30pm, Channel 4First Dates at ChristmasThe cheerful waiters and courting couples are decamping to a cosy country pub for this year’s Christmas special. May the mulled wine flow and the mistletoe work its magic!

Kylie herself is also in attendance. Christmas Day, 10.30pm, Channel 4Paddington: The Man Behind the BearStraight after a screening of Paddington 2 (7.20pm, BBC One) comes this documentary that celebrates the duffle-coated icon of decency by telling the story of his creator, Michael Bond. Boxing Day, 9pm, BBC TwoRichard Osman’s World Cup of the DecadeOsman’s odd sideline – refereeing votes on cultural ephemera – reaches a peak as he asks you, the tweeting public, to help choose the best film, TV, music, celebrity and innovation of the 2010s. Friday 27 December, 9pm, Channel 4The Decade the Music DiedWe lost a heartbreaking number of singular artists in the 2010s, and while you could argue the likes of Chuck Berry, Leonard Cohen and Aretha Franklin had a good innings, it felt as if Bowie, Prince and Amy Winehouse were all gone too soon. This film salutes their lives and careers. Friday 27 December, 9pm, Sky ArtsGogglebox Festive SpecialIf you find yourself beginning 2020 with the nagging feeling that you somehow missed the most noteworthy Christmas TV, Gogglebox has got you covered. This regurgitative special will see the sofa-bound arbiters pass snappy and snippy judgments on all the stuffed yuletide schedules. Friday 3 January, 9pm, Channel 4New Year’s Eve TVPeople stay home on NYE for many reasons (sobriety, young kids, JOMO) can TV cater to this disparate mob? It certainly tries. Musos can opt for either Jools’s Annual Hootenanny (11.15pm, BBC Two), which this year features Stormzy, La Roux and – still not giving us up – Rick Astley or Craig David Rocks Big Ben Live (11.25pm, BBC One). Chat-hounds may prefer The Graham Norton Show (10.20pm, BBC One), which has Tom Hanks on the sofa, while those after a laugh can turn to The Last Leg of the Year (9pm, Channel 4).A Berry Royal ChristmasMary Berry joins the Duke Wills and Duchess Kate on a tour of their charities, culminating in a Berry-catered party to honour festive volunteers. Nadiya Hussain is invited, obviously. Monday 16 December, 8.30pm, BBC OneA Merry Tudor Christmas With Lucy WorsleyChristmas Tudor-style meant a month of fasting and prayer before the serious revelry kicked off on 25 December. Hands-on historian Lucy Worsley is up for trying it all. Friday 20 December, 9pm, BBC TwoHugh Grant: A Life on ScreenPerhaps you hadn’t noticed but Hugh Grant has staged a subtle comeback, now universally adored for his dazzling turns in Paddington 2 and A Very English Scandal. This celebration revisits his varied career with the likes of Richard Curtis, Sandra Bullock and the man himself. Monday 23 December, 10pm, BBC TwoThe Last IglooExperience a day in the life of a Greenland Inuit hunter in this “slow TV” documentary. It makes for poignant viewing, since climate change has condemned this ancient way of life to extinction. Christmas Eve, 7pm, BBC FourRoyal Institution Christmas LecturesA festive perennial as hardy as the conifer, the lecture series turns to the world of numbers, with mathematician Hannah Fry considering the sums that dictate life, helped by, among others, the maths guru behind Liverpool FC’s winning run. From Boxing Day, 8pm, BBC FourWorld’s Strongest ManNow in several episodes stretched between Christmas and New Year, a grand tradition: lie belly-down on the sofa and see swollen fellas heave heavy objects around. From Boxing Day, 8pm, Channel 5Mystify: Michael HutchenceWhile unlikely to achieve the viral fame of last Christmas’s daft Bros doc, this intimate portrait of the late INXS frontman features revealing interviews with friends, family and lovers (and Bono). It is followed by the concert film Live Baby Live, recorded at Wembley stadium in 1991. Saturday 28 December, 9.20pm, BBC TwoThe Repair Shop at ChristmasGoodness, this show is lovely enough without it being Christmas as well. Craftspeople restore broken items that have huge sentimental value for their owners. Sunday 29 December, 7pm, BBC OneEEJ, JS and GVMamma Mia! Here We Go AgainThe enormous success of the original 2008 Abba-singalong came out of the Aegean blue, and now here we go again: this sequel is a five-star triumph. Cannily blending the young Donna’s 1970s Greek island adventures with the present-day wedding problems of daughter Sophie, it’s a sun-soaked delight. Saturday 21 December, 10am, Sky Cinema MusicalsScrooge: A Christmas Carol This 1951 adaptation is the warmest and also chilliest version of the Dickens tale, with Alastair Sim a Scrooge incarnate his miserly humbuggery is a gloomy delight. CM Pennington-Richards’s snowy, atmospheric photography is superb – and beware the ghostly visitation of Michael Hordern’s chain-clanking, shrieking Jacob Marley. A real gothic horror.Saturday 21 December, 3.10pm, Channel 5Mary Queen of ScotsA gorgeous-looking slice of historical drama from director Josie Rourke. Saoirse Ronan is young Mary Stuart, returning to Scotland in 1561 and posing a threat to her cousin, Margot Robbie’s Queen Elizabeth. The two are rivals, but also united as powerful women in a world of unscrupulous men. Sunday 22 December, 11.15am, 8pm, Sky Cinema PremiereToy Story 2This sequel surpasses even the great original: astronaut Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) takes on the heroic rescue of Woody the cowboy (Tom Hanks) from an unscrupulous collector in an inspired blend of high excitement, matchless animation and touching relationships, with a screenplay making fun of Star Wars and Jurassic Park. Monday 23 December, 1.25pm, BBC OneBraveThe fiery Princess Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald) is a female Braveheart in Pixar’s medieval mock fairytale. In the Highlands, she is outraged to learn that her parents (Billy Connolly, Emma Thompson) want to marry her off so away she stomps, in search of an alternative to the traditional fate of fairytale princesses. Monday 23 December, 2.55pm, BBC OneTamara DreweA touching adaptation of Posy Simmonds’s cartoon strip that spatchcocks middle-class country life. Gemma Arterton is Tamara, who returns to her native West Country village with an ambition to write a chicklit epic. There, she stirs the passions of ex Andy (Luke Evans), pop star Ben (Dominic Cooper) and slimy philanderer Nicholas (Roger Allam). Christmas Eve, 1.15am, BBC TwoThe Lego Movie 2: The Second PartEek! The Lego town of Bricksburg, ominously renamed Apocalypseburg, has been invaded by smiley-but-menacing Duplo figures from outer space. Ever-so-nice hero Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt) has to get macho to lead the resistance, in a sequel that’s full of self-referential jokes, soulful monologues and earwormy songs. Christmas Eve, 11.45am, 8pm, Sky Cinema PremiereElfWill Ferrell is full of festive cheer as the elf who learns he’s not really one of Santa’s little helpers – he’s 6ft tall and human, and has a very Scroogey dad (James Caan) in New York. There’s computer-animated trickery and warm support from the likes of Bob Newhart, Edward Asner and Zooey Deschanel – but it’s Ferrell who parcels out the fun. Christmas Eve, 5.15pm, ITVMary Poppins ReturnsThe Banks children – Ben Whishaw’s Michael Emily Mortimer’s Jane – are all grown up, but with Michael now a widowed father of three and in danger of losing the family home. Who should blow in one windy day but magic nanny Mary, now prettily played by Emily Blunt in Rob Marshall’s deft, enchanting sequel. It’s a big spoonful of pure joy. Christmas Day, 7.30am, 8pm, 4.20am, Sky Cinema PremiereFinding DoryAnother animated undersea search for a lost fish? This sequel is pretty much a rerun of Finding Nemo, but it is done with such vibrant beauty and soppy charm that it can easily be forgiven. Here, the amnesiac Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) sets out on a quest to find her family, while chums Nemo and Marlin in turn go looking for her. Christmas Day, 3.10pm, BBC OneThe OthersA distinctly chilly and unsettling horror story, this. Much of the credit goes to Nicole Kidman for her controlled performance as Grace, who lives a prison-like existence in a gothic Jersey mansion with her two children as they await the return of the father (Christopher Eccleston) from war. Christmas Day, 7pm, AMC from BTJurassic WorldBoasting an all-new cast of massive dinosaurs, this oversized upgrade rescued the franchise from extinction. The tourist crowds are flocking to the Jurassic World theme park – like lambs to the slaughter – when the genetically modified mega-raptor Indominus Rex starts running amok. Bryce Dallas Howard’s park manager and Chris Pratt’s dino-wrangler attempt to restore order in a fast, fun and thrilling carnivore caper. Christmas Day, 8pm, ITV2Avengers: EndgameFive years on from the events of Infinity War, the grieving Avengers reassemble for another tilt at Josh Brolin’s all-powerful Thanos. Directors the Russo brothers juggle the whole pantheon of Marvel heroes, and stage a staggering final battle in an epic conclusion to the 22-film saga. Thrilling, poignant and fun – especially when Chris Hemsworth’s Thor is on. Boxing Day, 10.45am, 8pm, Sky Cinema PremiereFlorence Foster JenkinsIn 1940s New York, Florence Foster Jenkins won a certain affectionate notoriety as “the worst goddamn singer in the world” – a socialite turned talentless a who nevertheless attracted a faithful following. Meryl Streep is marvellous as Jenkins, and Hugh Grant matches her as devoted partner-cum-manager St Clair Bayfield, in Stephen Frears’s note-perfect, poignantly funny biopic. Boxing Day, 11pm, BBC TwoSkyfallThis tip-top Bond pits Daniel Craig’s 007 against rogue agent Silva, played entertainingly by Javier Bardem. There are spectacular stunts in Macau and Shanghai, but this is a staunchly British affair, set largely in London before an unusually sombre showdown at Skyfall – the Highlands pile of Bond’s youth. Boxing Day, 8.30pm, ITVThe Limehouse GolemPeter Ackroyd’s Victorian novel gets a grisly, gripping screen treatment from director Juan Carlos Medina and screenwriter Jane Goldman. Bill Nighy plays detective John Kildare, who hunts a Ripper-like killer known as The Limehouse Golem, while trying to save murder suspect Lizzie (Olivia Cooke) from the gallows a pleasingly grim, clever melodrama. Friday 27 December, 9.30pm, BBC TwoSaving Mr BanksThe origins of the film legend that is Mary Poppins, served with a big spoonful of sugar by director John Lee Hancock. Emma Thompson is the wonderfully crotchety PL Travers, protective author of the book that Tom Hanks’s Walt Disney is desperate to bring to semi-animated cinematic life: it’s a supercali… (etc) double act. Sunday 29 December, 3pm, BBC TwoBridesmaidsPaul Feig’s raucous, sometimes tender, comedy stars co-writer Kristen Wiig as the put-upon Annie, who is losing best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) to marriage and to her horrible rich new bestie Helen (Rose Byrne). Can she win her back as maid of honour at the wedding? There is pathos and charm here, but mainly laughs (particularly from Rebel Wilson’s outrageous Brynn). New Year’s Eve, 9pm, ITV2Mission: Impossible – FalloutIt’s the sixth time around for Tom Cruise’s IMF agent Ethan Hunt, so heart-stopping motorbike and helicopter chases, crazy jumps from a tower block windowout of an airplane, and a brutal hand-to-hand battle in the gents could all seem a bit Mission: Everyday. Under the kinetic direction of Christopher McQuarrie, however, this is yet another breathlessly thrilling ride. New Year’s Day, 9pm, Channel 4No Country for Young WomenA festive edition of Sadia Azmat and Monty Onanuga’s podcast, which continues to explore – in cheerful and playful style – the issues facing young BAME women in a white man’s world.

Favourites Moomintroll, Sniff and Snufkin are all set to get up to mischief in their 13 episodes in Moominvalley, with well-placed voice acting from the likes of Taron Egerton, Rosamund Pike and Matt Berry. Billed as Finland’s most expensive TV show, with a budget of €20m, this labour of love will surely delight adults and kids alike. Ammar KaliaStephen Mulhern hauls a big sack of cash around Manchester, asking shoppers to complete daft tasks such as taping objects to themselves or identifying a celebrity Santa to get some wodge. If a lucky local can produce an actual penny from their pockets, they could even win a holiday to NYC. Graeme VirtueThe underwhelming music quiz reaches the end of its run. Hosts Marvin and Rochelle Humes do their best to keep things hyped but, basically, we’re dealing with 40 minutes of contestants naming pop songs from their intros – and even the £10,000 prize can’t transform that into a spectacle for the ages. Phil HarrisonCelebrity guests, a whooping audience and a bag of pranks are on offer in Michael McIntyre’s likable variety show.

Croatia is no longer on its knees, it’s upright. Croatia is again known in the world for its successes,” Grabar-Kitarović told a campaign rally in Zagreb on Thursday evening.A member of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), Grabar-Kitarović became the country’s first female president in 2015. She was previously foreign minister and assistant secretary general of Nato.She came to further prominence during Croatia’s run to the men’s football World Cup final last year, when she travelled to Russia to cheer on the team and appeared to strike up a warm relationship with Vladimir Putin, whom she presented with a Croatian football shirt.While positioned as a centre-right politician, she has been accused of engaging in “dog-whistle politics” to co-opt far-right supporters, an accusation that has intensified during this campaign.Grabar-Kitarović, Škoro and the former Social Democrat prime minister Zoran Milanović are the frontrunners in a field of 11. Polls show any two of the three could make it into a likely second-round runoff due in early January.“She has been going to the hard right, partly to face off the challenge of Škoro,” said Florian Bieber, a political scientist at the University of Graz. “It really pushed the whole debate to the hard right and nationalist themes. It’s not a very positive campaign.”Grabar-Kitarović has appeared uneasy on the campaign trail. She was widely mocked for a number of strange statements, including a promise of jobs that would pay €8,000 (£6,800) a month, almost 10 times the current average wage. At one point her campaign bus was involved in an accident and left without stopping.“Although still the favourite to win, she is behaving defensively and has made a series of pretty incredible blunders,” said Tena Prelec, a researcher at Oxford University’s department of politics and international relations.Škoro, who was once a HDZ member, has set himself up as an outsider standing againsthis former party and the Social Democrats, the two dominant political forces in Croatia since the country’s independence. Among his controversial campaign statements was a vow to pardon the convicted war criminal Tomislav Merčep, an indication of how the country’s recent past continues to influence contemporary debates.Prelec said the focus on these issues had come at the expense of those that really mattered to most Croatians, such as corruption, emigration and the politicisation of key institutions.The country’s HDZ prime minister, Andrej Plenković, has backed Grabar-Kitarović. While the presidency is a largely ceremonial role, the campaign has set the tone of political discourse in the country. “It’s less about power and more about how it skews the public debate,” said Bieber."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Comment: Of course Boris Johnson can get a good post-Brexit trade deal done in a year.

For once I am not lambasting politicians for this.Because I can’t blame them for the ide which I believe causes damaging pain, the gulf between generations. The fact is even the oldest and the youngest need each other.Documentaries by Channel 4 celebrating the success of nursery schools located in old people’s care homes underscore the point.The old need the young to keep us fit, strong and happy. The young need the old to tell them our stories and stop them stumbling into the same old landmines. And yet everything about our current society, where we live, how we shop, how we entertain ourselves, sets up barriers that keep us apart.Looking back to my own childhood, I see all of us grandchildren circling around my grandmother’s home. I visited her every weekend. When as an appalling teenager I ran away from home, it was to stay overnight with granny. But then we lived within a couple of miles of her.This Christmas I will be speaking, as I have for the past six years, to Silver Line callers, older people who are living alone, isolated from children, whose memories of happier years deepen their loneliness, but for whom Christmas is now, as one told me last year, “Just another day to get through.”Three years ago I helped to launch a project created in Torpoint by Elisabeth and David Carney-haworth, she a head teacher, he an ex-policeman. It’s called Silver Stories and like most brilliant ideas it’s so simple.Elisabeth asks six and seven year olds, year 2 of her primary school, (the “Silver Readers”), to telephone older people, (“Silver Listeners”), once a week in their lunch-time from their school, and read to them. Two of the Silver Readers, Holly aged 6 and Robert aged 7 rang me this week and read to me a poem about a rain forest.Holly told me she likes to read to older people “Because it’s a time when they can relax and have a cup of tea and a biscuit.” Robert added, “And because we can talk to them and make their day.”They agreed they both like talking to older people, as Robert explained, “Because I like reading, and it’s a nice way to say thank you to them.”When I revealed my age they responded with a satisfying “Wow”. I shocked them by revealing that when I was young there was no television, and I didn’t eat a banana until I was six. I explained it was due to the second world war, and they sang me the song they’ve been practising for their Remembrance service, “We’ll Meet Again.” The whole conversation was a delight.Doris, one of the Silver Listeners the children read to each Thursday, told me she used to teach in the school. Now aged 86 Doris lives in a care home near Manchester.She has osteo-arthritis which means she cannot stand or walk, and as almost everyone else in the home has dementia, she spends all her time sitting in her room, crocheting, doing puzzles and reading a great deal. Her husband died 14 years ago, “I miss him so much”. Her son lives in New Zealand, her daughter lives 150 miles away, she occasionally sees a child when a carer brings a toddler in, “I love it when they plonk them on my lap.” She misses the company of children, “I was with them for 24 years”, so for her Silver Stories are “A joy, I’m very grateful.”And she wrote her Silver Readers a poem to express her appreciation, “Dear children as you happily speak, I look forward to hearing you every week. Keep up the good work and all you do. Best wishes and a huge thank you.”So before Christmas this year, I would like to call upon every primary school to contact care homes in their area and ask for Silver Listeners. To be read to once a week is a pleasure. When you are deprived of children’s company, to be read to by 6 year olds is a special joy.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

These are Saint Thomas More Language College, Chelsea Academy and Kensington Aldridge Academy.This means that half of Kensington and Chelsea\u0027s secondary schools are both under-subscribed and outstanding, with similarly high proportions in Merton (33 per cent), Westminster (30 per cent) and Southwark (26 per cent).On the other hand, there were 91 constituencies that didn\u0027t have a single outstanding, under-subscribed school. These included from Blackpool, Derby, the Isle of Wight, Barking and Dagenham in London, Surrey and Wolverhampton. The most oversubscribed outstanding school in 2019 was The Royal School in Wolverhampton which had 7.94 first-preference applications for every place it offered.The outstanding school with the lowest ratio of applications per place was Notre Dame Roman Catholic Girls\u0027 School, in Southwark. In 2019, they saw 31 first-preference applications and yet handed out 123 places (a ratio of 0.25 applicants per place).One in ten local authorities do not have a single \u0027outstanding\u0027 schoolOne in ten local authorities do not have a single “outstanding” secondary school, an analysis by The  has found.There are 17 – including Brighton and Hove, Milton Keynes and South Gloucestershire – out of 151 local authorities in England, where not a single secondary has been given the top rating by Ofsted.Ministers are accused of putting “rocket boosters” under London’s schools while other parts of the county are left “fighting for resources” and falling behind.Anne Longfield, the Children’s Commissioner for England, said that youngsters in some parts of the country face a “double whammy of poverty and poor schools”.She said: “Every child should have the chance of going to an excellent school, yet too many are leaving fifteen years of education without even the basic qualifications.  “London’s education system has had rocket-boosters under it for nearly two decades, while schools in some poorer parts of the country are fighting for resources and falling further behind.”She said the Government must put a “relentless focus” on areas that are missing out, including help with recruiting good teachers and extra tuition for children who are struggling to keep up.  The other areas with no outstanding schools are Barnsley, Blackpool, Bury, Central Bedfordshire, Hartlepool, the Isle of Wight, Knowsley, Middlesbrough, North Lincolnshire, North Tyneside, Northumberland, St Helens, Swindon and Wigan.    Professor Sophie von Strumm, from York University’s department of education, said that regional variation in schools’ Ofsted rating is likely to be a reflection of differences in parents’ wealth.  “Rich parents move to areas with outstanding schools for their children,” she said.“However, attending an outstanding school doesn\u0027t make much of a difference for your school performance, it\u0027s your family background that matters.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “This government is determined that every child can benefit from a high-quality education, and teachers and school leaders are helping to drive up standards right across the country. They said that 85 per cent of children now in good or outstanding schools compared to just 66 per cent in 2010.When do you find out secondary school places?You find out about which school your child has been offered a place on March 1 for the following September. When is the secondary school application deadline?The application deadline is October 31 for children starting school the following September. Comment: Of course Boris Johnson can get a good post-Brexit trade deal done in a year.

Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002)The prequel trilogy has lived on in infamy, but the true low point of this low point in the Star Wars franchise must be Attack of the Clones, the dry, crusted middle of the cinematic sandwich. While Revenge of the Sith has some sense of completion and The Phantom Menace has some sense of wonder, all Attack of the Clones has is a CGI Yoda bopping about the screen like an unswattable fly while battling Christopher Lee’s Count Dooku. It’s a film driven by unnecessary desires: from the space politics, to Boba Fett’s backstory, to Padmé and Anakin’s romance. The latter is the most insufferable, since George Lucas never had much of an ear for dialogue, as notoriously pointed out by Harrison Ford when he declared on set: “George, you can type this s***, but you sure as hell can’t say it.” Which leads us to one of the worst line readings in cinematic history, when Hayden Christensen’s Anakin laments: “I don\u0027t like sand. It\u0027s coarse and rough and irritating – and it gets everywhere.”211 10. Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005)Hollywood has increasingly made the assumption that “darker” means better when it comes to cinema – it explains why the Harry Potter films look like they were made while someone gradually turned down the dimmer switch on the studio lights. Of course, audiences know that “darker” sometimes means that your protagonist-turned-villain becomes a “youngling”-murdering, amateur street magician-looking sourpuss. Anakin’s arc here comes to a whimper of an ending, underlined by the much-derided decision to have Darth Vader’s first moments onscreen involve him howling “Noooooo!” up to the sky like a mournful hound. That said, Ewan McGregor confirms here that he managed to escape the franchise largely unscathed, as this instalment sees him have the most fun with the clunky dialogue (see: “Hello there!” and “I have the high ground!”).311 9. Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999)The Phantom Menace escapes slightly ahead of the rest of the prequel trilogy, if only for the fact it remembers these films are meant to be fun once in a while. The pod race – it’s a good scene! Darth Maul is all looks, zero follow through – it’s embarrassing to act like you’ve won, only to be cut in half and sent hurtling down an exhaust pipe – but his inclusion in the film did introduce one of the best musical themes in Star Wars history, John Williams’s “Duel of the Fates”. However, the space politics are a particular drag here, with all the talk of trade disputes, and, of course, it\u0027s obligatory to mention the terror that is Jar Jar Binks.Although it’s the weakest of the new generation of Star Wars films, Solo still holds up as a fun romp worthy of Han Solo’s rascal reputation. Alden Ehrenreich picks up on enough of Harrison Ford’s mannerisms to sell the character without sliding into imitation, while Donald Glover is a scene stealer from the very moment he walks on screen as Lando Calrissian. It’s a lost opportunity, then, that the film is otherwise slowed down by an impulse to offer backstory to as many aspects of Han’s character as possible. Did we really need to know how we got the name “Solo”? Really?511 7. Star Wars: Episode IX – The Rise of SkywalkerDirector JJ Abrams, like the hero of an ancient prophecy, was destined to make both enemies and allies with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. There will be arguments. And there will be arguments about the arguments. There will be obsessive deconstructions and over-interpretations of each frame and intake of breath. But, at the end of the day, this is still a Star Wars film in its very bones, muscle, and sinew. Whatever controversy Abrams might have brewed up with his artistic choices, he still captures magnificently the soul of this series: that unwavering hope that the powerless can win, despite the odds. 611 6. Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) There’s a lot to wrap up in the concluding chapter of the original trilogy. The result is a few odd turns for the sake of plot convenience. What does one do with a character as enigmatic as Boba Fett? Why, have him topple into the Sarlacc pit within the first 20 minutes! How does one put to rest the love triangle hinted at in A New Hope? Why, insert a revelation that Luke and Leia are, in fact, brother and sister! Even the second Death Star oddly feels sillier than The Force Awakens and its third attempt at a giant ball in space, since The First Order at least had the excuse that their obsessive admiration of the Empire may have clouded their judgement. That said, there’s still plenty of charm to be found here and the Ewoks aren’t all that bad. Before you dismiss them as irritating merchandise opportunities, it’s worth remembering that they have absolutely no qualms about killing and eating people.If Rogue One is any indication of Disney’s plans for the franchise and its future, then there’s no cause for concern. The first of the “A Star Wars Story” spin-offs, it shifts into gear with ease, soothing audiences by not straying too far from the familiar timeline while introducing a full set of new characters and a grittier tone. Stylistically, it feels more like a Vietnam War movie and is proof of how far a gifted director like Gareth Edwards can stray from the franchise’s usual formula and still feel grounded in the same world. Plus, you have to admire the guts it takes to deliver an ending like that…Disney made a very smart move with The Force Awakens. As the first Star Wars film of a new generation, it not only had to make its own mark, but feel familiar enough that it welcomed fans back with open arms. The balance is hit perfectly here. That’s largely due to the film’s new trio of central heroes, who radiate the same kind of warmth, bravery, and spirit that carved a special place in people’s hearts when they were first introduced to the franchise’s original stars. Daisy Ridley’s Rey, John Boyega’s Finn, and Oscar Isaac’s Poe honour Star Wars\u0027s past while striding into its unknown future. It also helps that the film has landed on a villain like Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), whose drive and complexity may see him surpass even Darth Vader by the end of his story in Episode IX.Any isiveness the film attracted certainly proved one thing: here’s a Star Wars film that actually took a creative risk. And what a bold, ambitious, and ultimately beautiful risk that was. Director Rian Johnson took the cinematic legacy presented before him and added a new richness to its textures. He allowed heroism to go beyond the clean ide between good and evil through Luke and Rey, we were taught not to be ashamed of our doubts but to grow stronger because of them. We were taught not to use destiny as a crutch, but to know when to forge our own paths. The Last Jedi is a soulful film told through some of the most striking cinematography of the entire franchise.It’s the place where it all began. The Star Wars franchise has only become the success it is today because of how purely revolutionary the first instalment was as a piece of Hollywood filmmaking. It is, to this day, one of the most successful examples of the modern epic, endlessly imitated but so rarely with the same heart or ambition. George Lucas tapped into one of the most timeless qualities of storytelling: its ability to let us see and understand our own world through the eyes of another. Star Wars has become so iconic because, even on such a grand scale, we know and relate to the emotions at hand – fear, love, or a desire to do what’s right.The Empire Strikes Back is remarkable in its ability to pursue real emotional stakes. Its closing moments, the final note to its symphony of sacrifice and tragedy, leaves us with the single, delicate emotion that is hope, blooming in the darkness as our heroes set out to save Han and restore the Rebel Alliance. What A New Hope built up by making us fall in love with these characters, The Empire Strikes Back recouped in sharing with us their pain and their fears. Darth Vader’s reveal that he’s Luke’s father has, of course, found its place in history, but there’s an equal sense of emotional resonance in the moment Leia and Han depart, moments before he’s trapped in carbonite. When Leia’s “I love you” is returned by Han’s “I know” – a line written by Harrison Ford himself – we’re reminded of how magical Star Wars’s sense of storytelling can be, condensing everything that these two characters feel for each other into five simple words.111 11.

fisheries minister George Eustice said: “This year there has been some very challenging science for cod stocks in many parts of the northeast Atlantic and we have responded to conserve stocks.“I know that some of the quota reductions will be very difficult for some sectors of the industry, and there has been considerable debate this year about the importance of by-catch allowances to support the delivery of the discard ban.“However, we also know that\u0026nbspto protect the profitability of fisheries in the future\u0026nbspwe must fish sustainably today.”Scotland Office minister Douglas Ross said: “The UK government worked hard to secure the best possible deal for Scotland – defending the industry’s interests and the need to ensure the long-term health of fish stocks, in the face of challenging quota advice for species of great importance, such as North Sea cod.“The great news for our fishing industry and coastal communities is that, as we get Brexit done and become an independent coastal state, we will no longer be shackled by the hated Common Fisheries Policy.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when our seas face huge threats such as climate change and overfishing, the UK can lead the world by demonstrating sustainable, responsible management of our fisheries.”Chris Thorne, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “North Sea cod, like our oceans, are in crisis and so we welcome this decision to cut the quota, which we hope will give this\u0026nbspspecies space to recover.”The UK delegation was led by Mr Eustice, Mr Ewing, the Welsh government’s minister for Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs, Lesley Griffiths, and representatives from Northern Ireland.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is still not clear whether it was the result of a genuine fallout or a more friendly jibe.Mr Zuckerberg\u0027s Twitter account is hardly used at all, despite having more than 400,000 followers. While he used it throughout 2009 to write about new\u0026nbsp features, the only post since was a 2012 message that linked out to a post on his official Facebook page.Mark Zuckerberg followed one new person on Twitter this yearMr Zuckerberg followed only one user of the site through the whole year – in another unexplained, unusual interaction. But that happened at the beginning of the year and is not thought to be related to any of the new events.\u0026nbspSome have speculated that the goat – and perhaps all of the events – are in reference to a strange exchange between the two billionaires at the beginning of the year.In January, Mr Dorsey claimed that Mr Zuckerberg had served one of the animals as part of a meal, during a year when he was only eating food he had killed.Mr Dorsey said that Zuckerberg is a “very, very smart businessman,” and then he went on to say: “He made goat for me for dinner. He killed the goat.”The Twitter boss then clarified that Mr Zuckerberg did not kill the goat in front of him but “killed it before” their meal.“I guess he kills it,” he said. “He kills it with a laser gun and then the knife.

APTaking Harry Belafonte’s 1956 hit “Mary’s Boy Child” and singing it in medley with new song “Oh My Lord”, Boney M’s No 1 hit combined Christmas carol-like harmonies with Euro disco, steel drums and a reggae sensibility. It might sound disastrous – but somehow it works. AP“He’s gone2,000 milesIs very far,” sings Chrissie Hynde, above a twanging guitar riff in “2,000 Miles”, her serpentine melody stretching each syllable into several. You could easily assume it’s about two separated lovers, but it was actually written for the band’s original guitar player, James Honeyman-Scott, who died of a drug overdose a year earlier at the age of 25. The song is desperately bleak – as is the case with all the best Christmas songs – but with a note of festive hopefulness too. “The children were singingHe’ll be back at Christmas time.” AP418 15) Rockin\u0027 Around the Christmas Tree – Brenda LeeBrenda Lee was just 13 years old when she made herself a rockabilly legend thanks to the recording of this party classic. It always reminds me of scenes in The Santa Clause (one of the best ever Christmas films) where the jaunty number was heavily featured, along with seminal holiday movie Home Alone. RO518 14) Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow! – Dean MartinFew Christmas songs are as cosy as this one. Dean Martin’s smooth, rich voice is as warming as a good glass of whisky paired with sweeping, romantic strings and a chirpy flute, “Let it Snow!” conjures up images of stockings hanging up over the chimney, a Christmas tree glinting with baubles, and a frost-tinted window with snow falling outside. RO618 13) Walking in the Air – The Snowman  Peter AutyThough Aled Jones tends to get the credit for this haunting masterpiece, it is actually the voice of choirboy Peter Auty that appears in the climactic scene of the wordless 1982 animation The Snowman. He wasn’t credited though, and when his voice broke and Jones’s version reached number five in the UK charts, he was almost written out of history. In truth, though, whichever version you hear, the song’s sweeping grandeur is goosebumps-inducing. AP718 12) Peace on Earth Little Drummer Boy – David Bowie Bing CrosbyRecorded for Bing Crosby’s TV special Merrie Olde Christmas, and framed around a strange scripted exchange of banter between the two, this mash-up only came about because Bowie hated the song, “Little Drummer Boy”, that he had been asked on the show to sing. So songwriters Ian Fraser and Larry Grossman, alongside the show’s scriptwriter, cobbled together “Peace on Earth” to serve as a counterpoint, while Crosby performed the intended song. They recorded the resulting medley after less than an hour of rehearsal, and five weeks later, Crosby died. AP“Eartha Kitt is the sexiest woman in the world. You don’t write Christmas songs that are sexy. How are we going to do that?”This Mel Torme composition was originally written, according to Torme, with Bob Wells as a mind-over-matter attempt to stay cool during a stifling summer day in 1945. It’s one of Cole’s most enduring hits, and one of the most beloved of all Christmas songs. RO1018 9) I Believe in Father Christmas – Greg LakeThis Mel Torme composition was originally written, according to Torme, with Bob Wells as a mind-over-matter attempt to stay cool during a stifling summer day in 1945. It’s one of Cole’s most enduring hits, and one of the most beloved of all Christmas songs. RO1118 8) It\u0027s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year – Andy WilliamsAndy Williams’ classic brings to mind the kind of big, brash Christmas’s you see in American films – lots of presents, blazing fireplaces and a huge feast – but also plays heavily on the importance of spending time with your loved ones. It consistently appears in the top 10s of Christmas song rankings, and more than 50 years in, the 1963 staple shows no signs of wearing out. RO1218 7) \u0027Stop the Cavalry – Jona LewieIt was “just another anti-war song” until Jona Lewie threw a kazoo into the mix. The English singer-songwriter never intended “Stop the Cavalry” to become a Christmas single, but the festive mention in the line “I wish I was at home for Christmas”, along with the addition of a Salvation Army brass band and tubular bell, was enough to convince listeners.1318 6) Driving Home for Christmas – Chris ReaIn 1978, Rea thought it was all over. His record contract was done, and his manager had just told him he was quitting. Rea wanted to get home from London’s Abbey Road studios to Middlesborough, but his record company wouldn’t pay for a ticket.Sinatra’s version of this classic Christmas song opens on his isolated vocals before gradually introducing the swooning choir and tender strings section. And the lyrics: “Have yourself a merry little ChristmasMake the Yuletide gay  From now on your troubles will be miles awayHere we are as in olden daysHappy golden days of yoreFaithful friends who are dear to us  Gather near to us once more.” RO1518 4) All I Want for Christmas is You – Mariah CareyGeorge Michael wrote, performed, produced and played every single instrument on this song, where the narrator looks back with sadness on a past relationship. As with “Fairytale of New York”, you have an upbeat, cheerful rhythm and chirpy instrumentation, against the melancholy of unrequited love in the lyrics, with the suggestion that it was given away too hastily (“This year, to save me from tearsI’ll give it to someone special”). RO1718 2) Fairytale of New York – The PoguesSome of the best songs combine uplifting instrumentation that contrasts with lyrics that can be downright miserable, and such is the case for “Fairytale of New York”. It has none of the sickly sweet sentimentality of Mariah Carey’s “All I Want For Christmas Is You” or Wham!’s “Last Christmas”.Richard (Dick) Smith was suffering from tuberculosis, an illness which had plagued him since a child, from his bed in a sanatorium in Philadelphia. Gazing longingly out of his window at the snow, he wrote a poem describing all the things he would do when he was well again. He was inspired by the views of people playing in the park across the street from his family home on Church Street, where he’d lived with his mother, brother and two sisters. His father had died when he was a child. 118 18) Happy Xmas (War is Over) – John Lennon and Yoko OnoThere’s a caveat to the optimistic message of the song’s title. “War is over,” sing a choir of children over festive tambourines, but only, they add, “If you want it.” Having analysed the success of his previous single, “Imagine,” the former Beatle noted, “Now I understand what you have to do: Put your political message across with a little honey.” On this, an anti-Vietnam war protest song wrapped up in sleigh bells, strings and an anthemic melody, he does just that.

fisheries minister George Eustice said: “This year there has been some very challenging science for cod stocks in many parts of the northeast Atlantic and we have responded to conserve stocks.“I know that some of the quota reductions will be very difficult for some sectors of the industry, and there has been considerable debate this year about the importance of by-catch allowances to support the delivery of the discard ban.“However, we also know that\u0026nbspto protect the profitability of fisheries in the future\u0026nbspwe must fish sustainably today.”Scotland Office minister Douglas Ross said: “The UK government worked hard to secure the best possible deal for Scotland – defending the industry’s interests and the need to ensure the long-term health of fish stocks, in the face of challenging quota advice for species of great importance, such as North Sea cod.“The great news for our fishing industry and coastal communities is that, as we get Brexit done and become an

At a time when our seas face huge threats such as climate change and overfishing, the UK can lead the world by demonstrating sustainable, responsible management of our fisheries.”Chris Thorne, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “North Sea cod, like our oceans, are in crisis and so we welcome this decision to cut the quota, which we hope will give this\u0026nbspspecies space to recover.”The UK delegation was led by Mr Eustice, Mr Ewing, the Welsh government’s minister for Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs, Lesley Griffiths, and representatives from Northern Ireland.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Officials said they still had no idea what the recorded object was. Weather phenomenon, manmade craft and birds have all been ruled out.Created with Sketch.Revealed: eerie UFO sightings recorded in MoD files Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Speaking to the New York Magazine,\u0026nbspMr Underwood said: “The thing that stood out to me the most was how erratic it was behaving. And what I mean by erratic is that its changes in altitude, air speed, and aspect were just unlike things that I’ve ever encountered before flying against other air targets.“It was just behaving in ways that aren’t physically normal. That’s what caught my eye. Because, aircraft, whether they’re manned or unmanned, still have to obey the laws of physics. They have to have some source of lift, some source of propulsion. The tic tac was not doing that.”And he added: “You’re up there flying, like, ‘Okay. It’s not behaving in a manner that’s predictable or is normal by how flying objects physically move’.”Videos of UFOs spotted by military pilots are real, US Navy saysThe sighting came during a fortnight in which the USS Princeton had noted unknown aircraft intermittently passing across its radar systems off the US west coast. The contact was considered so inexplicable that the system was shut down and restarted to check for bugs — but operators continued to track the mysterious object afterwards.Then on 14 November, Commander David Fravor was flying a mission off the USS Nimitz when he eyeballed the object. It seemed, he later said, to e below the water, resurface, and speed out of sight when he approached.As Fravor landed, he told Underwood – just preparing to take off on his own mission – to be aware of unusual activity.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“Dave Fravor was like, ‘Hey, dude. BOLO,’ like, be on the lookout for just something weird,” Underwood said in his interview published on Thursday. “So, we go out to where our designated training area is. We’re not necessarily looking for something, but the Princeton had a specific object that they wanted us to hunt, for lack of a better word. And all of a sudden, I got this blip on my radar.”He said he did not see the object with his own eyes because he was focused on capturing video footage for intelligence to analyse later.Unusually, he was never fully debriefed on his sighting but had to take a phone call about the incident so soon after landing, he was still in his flight gear at the time.In the 15 years since, he said he has not speculated on what it might have been and had not previously given interviews because he did not want his name “attached to the ‘little green men’ crazies that are out there.”He added: “I do not want to be part of that community. It is just what we call a UFO. I couldn’t identify it. It was flying. And it was an object. It’s as simple as that. I’ll let the nerds, like, do the math on what it was likely to be. I just happened to be the person that brought back the video.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They have these massive eyes, bunched up noses… The condition is called brachycephalism.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He then tweeted a screenshot of the pug looking “nonplussed” after going viral online.Pugs in particular have exploded in popularity in recent years.

By the same measure, negative coverage of the Conservatives halved.The research also reveals a high presidentialised campaign, with Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn by far the most prominent figures in the media coverage. Interestingly, the researchers found that no contender for the next Labour leadership contest featured prominently in coverage.\u0026nbspThe study found that Brexit was by far the most dominant issue at critical points in the campaign – its start and end - but in intervening periods its prominence was lower.Research has shown that many voters only start paying attention in the last days of an election, so the final rush of Brexit coverage could have been consequential, the researchers said.\u0026nbspWhile the Conservatives had the edge in press coverage in 2017, the researchers found that the media landscape was much closer at the previous election: the Conservatives had a balance of minus 0.09 to Labour\u0027s minus 0.13 in the balance of positive and negative stories – meaning Labour was only somewhat more negatively portrayed.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So, regardless of what I feel … it’s not going to be heard because we don’t have a vote.”The capital’s lack of representation is a conundrum for many of the Americans who call it home. While DC has voted to become a state, it lacks a senator and only has delegates with limited voting privileges.\u0026nbspIt would take a constitutional amendment in order for Washington to become a state — a lengthy process that typically requires a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Otherwise, two-thirds of the nation’s state legislatures would have to call for a constitutional convention.\u0026nbspDespite its lack of representation, DC — a erse district and the first city to have a black majority, despite losing that title in recent years — consistently votes overwhelmingly Democrat. With a Republican majority controlling the Senate, there is slim chance of it becoming a state anytime soon.\u0026nbspOn the bright side, Washington residents can vote for president the district has three electoral votes in the presidential election and turnout has risen in recent election cycles.Unfortunately for Williams, she says she doesn’t see a strong candidate on the 2020 campaign trail who she wants to support.\u0026nbsp“Quite honestly, I’m not impressed by any of them inidually,” she says. “If we could take some of them and make one person, I think that would be very helpful.”When asked which candidates she’d group together to create a fictional superhero-like\u0026nbsppresidential nominee, Williams names Julian Castro, Kamala Harris — who has since dropped out of the race — Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang.\u0026nbspSeparately, Williams can’t help but notice some obvious weaknesses in each of them.\u0026nbsp“Elizabeth Warren has a lot of lofty ideas about how she’s going to exclude corporate dollars, but you’re not going to be able to do that if you want to win. So, she’s going to have to make concessions there,” she says.She adds: “Andrew Yang…he’s just fresh, he’s thinking differently … and then Julian Castro has the benefit of being inside Washington as a Cabinet member. Is there something familial about him that I can connect with? Definitely.Williams says the top issues she’s focusing on in 2020 are education and healthcare, which she believes “go hand in hand.”\u0026nbspShe wants to see major reforms that totally revamp both systems and create long-term solutions to some of the biggest problems the country is facing.\u0026nbsp“If we improved our education across the board … that would contribute to being knowledgeable about some of the health factors out\u0026nbspthere to avoid or fix early on, mental health included,” she says.\u0026nbsp“Healthcare and education are very important to me, but I also see the state of the world and how we contributed to it. My first concern is: can we just get this man out?”I ask if Williams is referring to Donald Trump. She immediately interjects: “He’s horrible. I mean, there’s nothing redeeming about him. The longer he is in his seat as president, the more we see that he has absolutely no regard for the constitution, which is supposed to be our bible, so to speak.”Williams says she’s going to vote for whoever becomes the Democratic nominee after the primary process.\u0026nbsp“After he’s removed from office — my mouth to God’s ear — I’ll see what they’re going to do in terms of everything else,” she adds.I notice Williams doesn’t ever say the name of the president out loud, even while referring to him often.“With the incumbent, he doesn’t fight or attack on the real issues, so basically it’s name-calling, and we’re 13-year-olds in eighth grade again, so i will completely disregard him about his comments on any of the candidates, she continues.\u0026nbspIt’s very immature, very infantile, it’s like: shut up already!”I ask her if she isn’t mentioning the president’s name on purpose.“Yes,” she responds. “I try to avoid it, but I just feel like every other president in my lifetime brought a certain level of dignity and respect to the office. … I always thought they respected the office of the president. So I\u0026nbspwon\u0027t be disrespectful or call him out by his name … he’s just the incumbent — for now.”\u0026nbspPolarized is a weekly series featuring Americans from all 50 states sharing their views on the 2020 elections.

A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes. Foundations like TOMS have given 95 million pairs of shoes to people across 82 countries.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Evaline, 11, was enrolled in grade three at Remagwe primary school, when at the age of eight, her father passed away suddenly. In 2018, she returned to school with the help of her teenage sister, who had told her about the EAA-GMT education programme. She lives with her mother, who is a farmer, and her four siblings in a grass thatch house with no mattress. Evaline helps her mother with farming and domestic work. The family survive on two meals per day, usually one meal of soft porridge and another of stiff porridge. She walks about 1.5 hours each way to school, something not uncommon to these children in the hardest to reach areas of northwestern Tanzania. Evaline dreams of becoming a nurse and understands she can achieve her dreams through education. Her role model is Maria, a nurse in the city of Mwanza who originates from her village. Evaline’s message to the world is that they should support all the children to receive education.Often shoes that adhere to a specific dress code are required for students to attend school. In addition to uniforms, books, transportation, other informal fees or the cost of shoes can be a roadblock to enrolment. TOMS Giving Shoes help to reduce families’ financial burden.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Afya, 14, was enrolled into primary school through the EAC and GMT partnership in 2017, after being identified in the out-of-school children survey. Despite being enrolled in school, poverty still remains her greatest challenge. Her  refuses to contribute to the informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required to continue enrolment.Matteus, nine, in the office of the principal at Remagwe school, looks down while he nervously scratches at the torn and faded zebra-print fabric sofa. One of the pre-requisites for children attending school in Tanzania is that parents must contribute to scholastic materials like school uniform and shoes, of which he has neither. His parents, both farmers, are unable to earn more than £375 a year in wages. They are sustaining a family of five. Matteus was identified through the partnership as being from an incredibly poor background, which would prevent his enrolment. He wakes early to ensure all the farm chores are complete by 11am. When he returns from school at 6pm he collects the cattle from the pastures and then helps his mother in the house with any jobs. Matteus and his siblings have two meals a day of porridge and bananas. They cannot afford any protein in their diet.Elizabeth, now 16, was enrolled at school aged 13 with the partnership, which helps the hardest to reach children struggling with things like poverty, early marriage and female genital mutilation. At age six, her father passed away, followed by her mother when she was 12. She was placed under ship of her uncle, who was arranging her marriage, with her unaware. The incentive for parents looking to marry their daughters is to benefit from sizeable dowry payments, more often livestock or land. Elizabeth’s second uncle heard the news of the marriage arrangements and spoke to the new education programme. Elizabeth wanted to enjoy her right to education and her second uncle helped void the pending marriage arrangements. She explained how extremely grateful she is to the foundation that gave her the opportunity to enrol and avoid the marriage she never wanted.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added, “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Josephine, 14, is an orphan and now lives with her aunt. She lost her parents and youngest sister to Aids, however, her blood-work is clear and negative. She was enrolled into the joint education partnership in 2017. Living far from school, she is forced to travel 4km to get there. Poverty remains a constant worry for Josephine as her aunt will not contribute to the additional costs. When asked what it meant to her to have access to education she replied, “Being in school means I will face less hardship and have a less fragile future. I would much prefer to be in class than live at home with my aunt who tries to prevent my going to school. She often beats me. She wants me to get married.” She was identified by the partnership as being vulnerable and teachers would buy her exercise books to ensure she doesn’t go without. Despite being three years behind she is catching up extremely quickly and ranking in the top five students out of 168 pupils.A young girl nervously clasps her hands as she explained how she was beaten repeatedly and threatened with being married off at the age of 13. In remote rural parts of Tanzania, the average age of marriage is between 12-13, from which point they are invited to leave the family home and fend for themselves. This makes them extremely vulnerable.A young boy seated in a dark classroom. In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP) and eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. But the programme has faced many challenges.A young girl enrolled at Remagwe school in northwestern Tanzania. The school allows her to attend without uniform, which is a rarity. Uniform, shoes and scholastic materials are expected to be funded by parents under voluntary parental contributions, which are around £10 per year. The fees are an enormous barrier to enrolment, typically parents working as farmers will collectively earn no more than £375 a year in wages that must support and sustain a family.Maryam, 12, has been enrolled in primary school since 2014. She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity. Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. This bold move by the government saw a rapid increase in enrolment overnight but abolishing school fees has left schools trying to deliver education on a shoestring budget. Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.Today poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education and no better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes. Foundations like TOMS have given 95 million pairs of shoes to people across 82 countries.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Evaline, 11, was enrolled in grade three at Remagwe primary school, when at the age of eight, her father passed away suddenly. In 2018, she returned to school with the help of her teenage sister, who had told her about the EAA-GMT education programme. She lives with her mother, who is a farmer, and her four siblings in a grass thatch house with no mattress. Evaline helps her mother with farming and domestic work. The family survive on two meals per day, usually one meal of soft porridge and another of stiff porridge. She walks about 1.5 hours each way to school, something not uncommon to these children in the hardest to reach areas of northwestern Tanzania. Evaline dreams of becoming a nurse and understands she can achieve her dreams through education. Her role model is Maria, a nurse in the city of Mwanza who originates from her village. Evaline’s message to the world is that they should support all the children to receive education.Often shoes that adhere to a specific dress code are required for students to attend school. In addition to uniforms, books, transportation, other informal fees or the cost of shoes can be a roadblock to enrolment. TOMS Giving Shoes help to reduce families’ financial burden.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Afya, 14, was enrolled into primary school through the EAC and GMT partnership in 2017, after being identified in the out-of-school children survey.

No better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania, where a 12-year-old boy, out of school, forced\u0026nbspinto a life of work, trapped in a dead-end cycle of danger and despair so he can provide for his family, provides perspective. He says: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my brothers and sisters.

Illegally, he scavenges the mines for residue-bearing rock which he digs up and sells to middle-men who crush and extract the gold.

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan. He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011.

I am staring at my canvas camera bags, which sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world.\u0026nbspNow they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away…Here I have compiled a collection of photographs and memories, comprising the stories of some of the most marginalised children in the world.Winter: Abdul, a Syrian refugee aged 10, is seated in a makeshift shelter, perched high among\u0026nbspthe rugged snowy mountain caps of Arsal, Lebanon. He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child.

All the while, their president publicly feasts\u0026nbspin lavish establishments. Roughly 3.5 million Venezuelans, among them doctors, lawyers and teachers, have left their country, out of starvation and fear.Joender, aged six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela, arrived in\u0026nbspIpiales, Colombia, exhausted and hungry. He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive. His cupped hands are\u0026nbsprewarded with a packet of biscuits donated by a local in the town. He clutches\u0026nbspthe packet like a prize. Having never begged for food myself as a child, I could not begin to understand the internal dialogue in doing so. I knew I could simply open a fridge door\u0026nbspJoender\u0026nbspcan’t.Summer:\u0026nbspEsperence, aged 10, is a Haitian “restavek” or child slave. He was\u0026nbspgiven away by his biological parents to a more affluent household and\u0026nbspforced into a life of domestic servitude. The feeling of being abandoned proves\u0026nbspto be too much for him. Standing in the kitchen and washing dishes, he simply shrugs his small shoulders, and one by one the tears roll\u0026nbspdown his face. Hours each day are spent cleaning, sweeping and washing.\u0026nbsp“I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs,”\u0026nbsphe says.\u0026nbspNearly 260 million children aren’t in school – do we care?

In a dark room in remote north western Tanzania, she explains\u0026nbsphow not going to school saddens\u0026nbspher. But she nonetheless still dreams that somehow she could become a teacher to help others like her with no access to education. I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0026nbspI had to go to school. Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life. Children around the world live with no access to healthcare, displaced from their home, going to sleep hungry, growing up in conflict and with no\u0026nbspeducation.I did not choose my career any more than I chose my life. It chose me, and it is the greatest privilege, a blessing and a burden in the same breath.

It’s what we lacked in the election”.The explosive remarks came in an exchange with a Labour colleague on Facebook messenger, which has been leaked to The Sun.Asked by the colleague why he wasn’t joining calls for Mr Corbyn to resign, Mr Russell-Moyle declared: “Because I’m not a c*** like those calling for his immediate resignation”.The firebrand MP added: “All the people saying stand down immediately are not saying it in good faith and that’s reason enough to ignore.“Anyonesays that they knew exactly what was wrong I’m afraid is a liar and a charlatan, and I will take no lessons from people who have spent the time undermining the party in all sorts of manners ofthe last few years”.In the conversation, Mr Russell-Moyle also stuck the kne into moderate Labour MP and potential leadership contender Jess Phillips, a long-standing Corbyn critic.Referring also to veteran Labour MP John Spellar, he added: “Jess Phillips would be a disaster. I think she would be truly terrible. I would have anyone but Jess. Well, maybe not anyone – Spellerwould be worse”.When contacted by The Sun last night about his attack on other Labour MPs and the use of his language, Mr Russell-Moyle said: “I said that because calling for Jeremy to go now is a silly and I would go so far to say c***ish thing to say.The best thing is for Jeremy Corbyn is to move aside in an orderly and organised fashion.“In private communications, it is an acceptable word to use, in public though it wouldn’t be.”He also accused the person who leaked the messages to be a suspended member of the party.Mr Russell-Moyle added: “People were speaking with knee jerk reactions the day after the election. We were hurting”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s moreyou’re working. But just tell them you’re unemployed or a student. They won’t check. Most of their current members are one or the other.And look who you have to choose from! Such a rich tapestry of political brilliance.David Lammy! Yay! The man who hates the police stop and search policy. A man who will brand you a racist before you’ve even opened your mouth.Richard Burgon! A plank of wood into which a village idiot has drilled two eyes and a mouth. Rebecca Long-Bailey — so inept even her own party members refer to her as Rebecca Wrong Daily.We could even co-ordinate and demand that they keep Magic Grandpa as boss. I mean, the party still seems to be in a state of denial. It was nothing to do with Corbyn! The voters loved him and loved our policies! We only didn’t win because of, er, Tory lies. The voters are thick, you see. Oh — and Brexit.For a very long time I was a member of the Labour Party. The main reason I left is the main reason nobody voted for it this time around. It is no longer the party of the poor and the working class.It has become a fringe group for metropolitan, middle-class liberals.Look at the only places it did well. Cambridge, Putney, Canterbury. Ha, bring on the revolution, then.“Are we manning the barricades, Cressida  Can I finish my Yakult first ”In a sense it doesn’t really matter who wins their leadership race. Labour lost not just because of the idiotic Corbyn or because of Brexit. It goes far deeper than that.It is the culture of the party. It despises everything its old voter base stands for. Even the moderates.It cannot abide patriotism, for a start. Its old voters are rather proud of Britain, and what Britain stands for. Corbyn and his allies hate our country.The traditional Labour voters believe in the traditional family, too. They have no time for identity politics and political correctness. They want a better deal, but don’t buy into all of the infantile agit-prop that goes along with today’s Labour Party.How the hell do you change that when the far-Left munchkins of Momentum still hold all the power There are still good people in the Labour Party. Some of them — like the brilliant Caroline Flint — lost their seats last week because of what Labour has become.Look at it now. Corbyn is STILL the leader. There is nothing they can do to get rid of him. He’s called for a period of reflection. It didn’t take the voters very long to reflect, did it We need a new party which represents working class people, especially away from London. That’s why I joined the Social Democratic Party.And we can happily leave the Labour Party to its “reflections”. Its support for terrorists, its loathing of the West. It STILL thinks it got its policies right.Even with a new leader it will still be terminally deluded.SO, is the BBC biased Welsh gob on a stick Huw Edwards thinks it is impeccably neutral. But then he would, wouldn’t he  But don’t take my word for it.Here’s the brilliant ex BBC journo and newsreader Michael Buerk, writing in the magazine The Critic. “ . . . all the presenters on the Today programme have been privately educated, like an astonishingly high proportion of the BBC’s editorial and production staff.”He added: “These are unormly bright, urban, young, well-educated arts graduates who have moved smoothly from one liberal institution to another. With little understanding of, or sympathy for, industry, business, the countryside or of course Brexiteers.”As Buerk pointed out, the BBC’s worldview is formed by the people who work for it.An estimated  per cent of them were against Brexit and there are plenty of objective studies which bear out a huge bias against Brexit.Go get ’em, BoJo.The advice is to always park where there are lots of people nearby .And in a well lit area. With the back of the car as close to a fence or kerb as possible.Anyway,someone sidles up to you in the pub and offers you a catalytic converter for a ton, here’s what to do.Kick him in the penkies and shove the converter as far up his rectum as is humanly possible.He’ll be passing incredibly clean wind, regardless of how many sprouts he eats.IS it possible to be more thick than Lauren Goodger  If so, how The Towie “star” got caught in a sting by the BBC. She was filmed endorsing a supposed health drink called Cyanora.She was told the product contained hydrogen cyanide, one of the most lethal substances known to mankind. But not known to Lauren, apparently.She was perfectly happy to give it her blessing. She admitted she’d never tried it . But then she also admitted she had never tried another product she had endorsed.Listen. Never believe TV personalities, actors, singers, etc.Don’t believe them when they tell you what way to vote. Don’t believe them when they’re trying to flog you something. For the most part they’re just greedy and thick as a plate of mince.OH what a pleasure it was to walk around a nice liberal, middle-class area of London last weekend singing: “Ohhhhhh Jeremy Corbyn!”The looks of hatred! I suppose it’s wrong to take pleasure in other people’s misery. But sometimes I can’t help it. Years of being told we’re all bigoted, racist and uneducated, I suppose.My we said she was more thrilled by the election result than she was by the birth of our daughter, which I think is pushing it a bit.Anyway, Boris Johnson has proven that he is a very canny politician indeed.He won the Mayor of London elections twice – by wooing the most right-on liberal electorate in Europe. And then he appealed to exactly the opposite tranche of voters to win the election last week.Huge credit, mind, to his adviser Dominic Cummings. A very sharp bloke – and from the North East. He never had any doubts about the result.What, being called a “smarty-pants”  If you end up troubled by having been called something like that  years previously, I would argue that your problems lie a lot deeper and were not actually caused by the insult.Shouldn’t we be trying to instil a degree of resilience among you people  Rather than feeling “triggered” at every single thing that’s said to them TURKEY is rapidly becoming the pariah state of the world.Its horrible government allows the genocidal terrorists Hamas to plot attacks on Israel from within Istanbul.The Turkish leader, Recep Erdogan, recently rolled out the red carpet for the Islamist maniacs of Hamas.A few years ago we were anxious to welcome Turkey into the European Union.Now we should impose sanctions on the country.Friends of anti-Jewish terrorists are no friends of ours.CHRISTMAS is the time of year when you open a bottle from the fridge expecting a nice glass of wine and it’s actually the we’s non-alcoholic “Christmas Mulled Berry Punch”, which tastes like a Moroccan’s gusset.The time of year when the rellies turn up, like not very wise men, each bearing their present of a bloody panettone which nobody anywhere will eat.When the awful Lonely This Christmas, by Mud, gets dragged out of its tomb – I’ve hated that song for  years.When good, God-fearing Christian people kick the s**t out of each other in an attempt to secure the last PlayStation, or something, in the sales. Ah well. There are compensations, I suppose.Half a day off work spent with a bottle of Jack Daniel’s and some Mon Cheri liqueurs in my tightly locked office watching a rerun of Millwall beating Arsenal at Highbury in . Can’t top that.It’s been a helluva year – hope you all have a lovely Christmas Day and get all that you wished for. x Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

RUIs are what the Law Society’s head of justice has described as a “major scandal” waiting to erupt.I know Home Secretary Priti Patel will have a lot on her plate as Parliament begins, but this ought to be one of her top priorities.The shocking overuse of RUI came to light on Wednesday, after -year-old thug Ewan Ireland was jailed for le for the murder of solicitor Peter Duncan in a Newcastle shopping centre in August.Peter’s misfortune was to have brushed past Ireland in the doorway of a shop, an act which Ireland took as a slight.He took hold of the screwdriver he had stolen minutes earlier and drove it into Mr Duncan’s heart.It is a tale of mindless, casual violence which has become all too common in modern Britain as the jumped-up egos of young men rage against anyone who gets in their way.But what makes it all the more disturbing is that Ireland’s tendency for extreme violence was well known to police and the courts, yet still he was allowed to walk the streets.While other boys of his age are busy studying for A-levels, Ireland had already amassed a formidable range of criminal qualications.He had  convictions for  dferent offences. He was on conditional discharge for an offence of battery and on bail for a charge of affray for threatening to slash another boy’s Achilles’ tendon.Yet in spite of all this, he had been released under investigation for a robbery.He is not the only violent criminal to have been sent on his way by police. In September last year Alan Martin, of Sunderland, was released by police after his estranged we accused him of raping her.Not only did officers release him, they also ed to him the keys to his we’s house. He promptly ed to the address, attacked her with a hammer and strangled her before taking his own le, too.Astonishingly, Northumbria Police were later cleared by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. No one seems to want to take responsibility. No doubt it will be the same next time, too.Since April , , violent criminals have been released under investigation, Home Office figures reveal.Unlike police bail, no restrictions have been placed on these people. They are not banned from visiting particular places, they have not had to raise a deposit, hand over their passport or report to police at regular intervals. Nor, unlike police bail, is there any time limit on RUI, so police are under no pressure to bring charges quickly.The misuse of RUI is a hangover from Amber Rudd’s time as Home Secretary. It was her Policing and Crime Act  which stopped police putting people on bail for periods of more than  days. True, something needed to be done. The case of former Radio  DJ Paul Gambaccini had inspired the rule change.He had been held on bail for a whole year as police investigated accusations of historic sex offences which turned out to be without foundation.Unable to put criminals on bail for more than  days, police forces took to releasing them under investigation instead.That might be perfectly reasonable in the case of relatively minor crimes which take a long time to investigate, but it is hardly an appropriate way to treat suspected murderers and rapists, especially those with a long history of violent offences.At the very least, people suspected of violent offences — and for which good evidence exists that those offences really did take place — need to be monitored.As for people who have been released on licence while serving sentences for previous convictions, there should be no argument at all — they should be taken back to prison without hesitation.Ministers like to talk tough on crime, especially around election time, but behind the scenes they get caught in the stranglehold of the liberal establishment.Punishments get weakened, prisoners get released early.Disgracefully, former Home Secretary Jack Straw described the sentencing system as the “benign deception of the public”, who, unaware of the soft reality, assume that criminals are being properly punished.But there is nothing benign about serial offenders being freed to rape and murder when police and the courts know full well their records.During the election campaign, Boris Johnson finally called an end to the deception.Braving an onslaught from the nation’s liberal consciences, he announced that prisoners will no longer be eligible for automatic early release — something which allowed the London Bridge killer Usman Khan to embark on his murderous spree.But the Johnson Government should not end there.It needs to stop the police releasing violent offenders back into the community without any restrictions on their movements nor any requirement ever to report to a police station.Liberals like to say that we can’t solve crime just by jailing people. On the contrary, had Ewan Ireland been kept out of circulation after his first offence it would alone have meant  fewer crimes in Newcastle over the past four years.It is hard enough to catch criminals.But to release those we do catch, giving them the freedom to embark on long crime sprees, is plain madness.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And then he also didn’t notice when the car span round and hit the front of his lorry again.And finally he didn’t notice when he was ­actually pushing the car SIDEWAYS along the busy dual carriageway.The man in the Golf was presumably leaning on his horn as hard as he was leaning on his brakes. Everyone in every other car on the road was also leaning on their horn and gesticulating.But still, chummy in the cab kept rolling along. I have spoken to lorry drivers about how this could be possible and they say that in the Daf truck that our friend was driving, it isn’t.They say that in a Volvo you sit so high up, your view of the road ahead is obscured by clouds and solar flares. But the seating ­position in a Daf is ­famously low down.So he MUST have noticed that instead of a teddy tied to his radiator grille, he had a full-sized Golf. Me though  I have another suggestion.Yes, the Golf’s tyres would have been making a right old din buthe’d had the radio on, maybe he didn’t hear them.And sure, it takes quite of lot of effort to push a Golf sideways along the road. But the engine in that Daf is designed to haul tonnes, and at the time of the incident no trailer was attached.Now that I’m a farmer, I understand the problem here. All my neighbouring farmers say that my new tractor is far too large.To which I say that tractors are like penises. And therefore cannot be too large. They also say the  horsepower it develops is too much.And on that, I sort of know what they mean. In a less powerful tractor you can sense when the ground is soft or the load is too heavy.But in mine, I just sit there listening to the radio, not noticing that my cultivator on the back has become entangled in a hedge and is ripping the whole thing out of the ground.Once, I turned round after I’d done a nice straight line across a field, to find I’d been pulling a whole postcode behind me.There were houses, schools and even a ­couple of churches in the mountain of mud I’d been dragging along.If I somehow hit a Volkswagen in my tractor, and I couldn’t see it out of the window, I definitely wouldn’t notice.Any more than I’d noticea baby wren landed on the roof. I’m sure that for the Golf driver on the A, it must have been a pretty scary moment. I sympathise with him.But I also sympathise with the lorry driver who set off to work as a man and arrived as an internet sensation with no one to sympathise with him except me and an eye-witness called Ellie Goulding.WE were told on Wednesday that Australia had endured its hottest day EVER.But that’s not strictly accurate. Yes, the average temperature across the whole of the country was .Cand that’s pretty toasty.But several million years ago, the world was around ten times hotter than that.And back in the days when rock was still liquid and the continents were sorting themselves out, temperatures hovered round the clock at around ,C.So when scientists say Australia has had its hottest day ever, what they mean is: “Australia has had its ­hottest day since records began.”Which in geological time is about . of a second.Big headlines in Buenos Aires, for sure. And maybe a fleet heading off to the Falklands again.WHEREVER my late mother is right now, she’ll be very happy, because Nicky Henson has died. She adored him.He was best known as the lothario from Fawlty Towers, but she loved him best for his stage performance in Noises Off.She loved him so much, in fact, thatmemory serves, she went to see him every night for about a year.Because it was so sweaty and horrid in there, I walked through the door, turned round and walked straight out again.IF you are wondering what to watch on TV over Christmas, may I suggest The Last Ship, on Amazon Prime.The executive producer is Michael Bay, which means everything blows up all the time.It features a really cool destroyer, some really bad baddies and some really cool goodies who say: “Secure the perimeter” every five minutes.Best of all, though, it stars the incomparable Rhona Mitra, whose work, and face, I’ve admired for years.THE Labourites squabbling over who will be their next party leader are all saying they’ll keep Jeremy Corbyn’s policies alive.This is excellent news because, in five years, we will get yet another chance to keep them out of Downing Street.SO, there’s a -year-old man in Norway who’s won  elite games of chess on the trot and is now the World Champion.That’s pretty impressive, but for Magnus Carlsen it’s just an aside, because in his local football league he’s a bit of a star as well.In fact, last time out, he scored  goals. At two, he could solve -piece jigsaw puzzles. By five he could recall the size, population and flag of every country on Earth.And by  he’d become a chess grandmaster. You’d imagine, then, that with such a mind he could do anything with his le. Unwrap the secrets of cold fusion.Conquer the problems of faster-than-light travel. Work out how you can open the wrapping of a Gillette razor using only your hands. But no.Instead, Magnus turned his attention to fantasy football, where, inevitably, he’s thrashed seven million other players to become the best in the world.As I write, he’s about to beat the all-time record of  undefeated games. And why did he do this, when he could have achieved so much more Well, it might have something to do with the fact he’s Norwegian. The Norse don’t like to make a fuss.They don’t like to stand out. Which is why, in the country’s entire history, all they’ve ever invented is the cheese kne.FINALLY, may I just take a moment to wish everyone in the whole world a very happy Christmas.Except Diane Abbott and Jeremy Corbyn.

He told how he held on to Khan’s wrists to prevent him stabbing or setting off the fake device, which he believed to be genuine at that time.Footage also showed an armed cop dragging Darryn off Khan and then shooting the terrorist dead.Images of his heroics went global immediately following the November  attack — during which Cambridge graduates Saskia Jones, , and Jack Merritt, , were killed.But Darryn’s identity remained a mystery until yesterday when he told his story for the first time in a bid to unite people against terrorism and raise money for the ­families of the victims.South African Darryn, who has lived in the UK for  years, had been at the Learning Together prisoner rehabilitation event organised by Cambridge University in a professional capacity when convicted terrorist Khan went berserk. He told of hearing a commotion downstairs as the jihadi began attacking people.Darryn said: “When we heard the noise from the floor below, a few of us rushed to the scene. I took a narwhal tusk from the wall and used it to defend myself and others from the attacker.“Another man was holding the attacker at bay with a wooden chair. I ran down the stairs, stood next to the man with the chair, and the two of us confronted the attacker. He had knives in both hands and, upon seeing me with the narwhal tusk, pointed at his midrf.“He turned and spoke to me, then indicated he had an explosive device around his waist. At this point, the man next to me threw his chair at the attacker, who then started running towards him with knives raised above his head.”Darryn then passed the tusk to his unarmed comrade before racing back upstairs to find another of the spear-like ornaments to use. When Darryn ed, he found the first tusk “shattered across the floor” and people running from the building.He said: “Along with ­others, I pursued the attacker, tusk in hand, on to the bridge. We called out to warn the public of the danger and, after a struggle, managed to restrain him to the ground. At that point, I was trying to isolate the blades by holding his wrists so that he could not hurt anyone or set off the device.”As well as volunteer Saskia and event co-ordinator Jack, three other people were stabbed, including ­Polish kitchen worker Lukasz ­Kocz­ocik, , who battled the terrorist with a ft-long ceremonial rod.Darryn praised those injured for being “so brave” and wished them a “speedy recovery”, saying some had refused treatment until others more seriously hurt were tended to first. He added: “That consideration and kindness filled me with hope on that dark day.”He also said he was “eternally grateful” to the prisoners attending the rehab event and members of the public who ran to help. Darryn said: “Not only do I want to thank those who confronted the attacker, but also those who put themselves in danger to tend to the injured, relying on us to protect them while they cared for others.“To the emergency services, you did yourselves and the country proud. I thank you too. To the public, I hope that the part I played in these terrible events can be used for good.”In the wake of the attack, Darryn has set up a project called Extinguish Hate, to “challenge hate and spread kindness”. He also urged people to donate to the victims’ fundraising pages — saskia-jones.muchloved and the Celebration of the Le of Jack Merritt on GoFundMeDarryn, who lives in London, said he had omitted many details of his account “out of respect for the victims and their families”.He said he now wants “time and space” to continue his recovery since the traumatic events of that day, but urged the Press to use its “amazing ability to connect with people” as a force for good to “uny this country”.And he added: “I feel we all have a duty to challenge the spread of fear, hatred or intolerance within our communities.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But not quite.Even we, though, didn’t dare to dream that a proper Brexit — no customs union, no single market, fully taking back control — would pass by a thumping margin under a Boris Johnson Government beginning five years in power.The Remainer wreckers are gone. Yet, incredibly, Brexit was STILL opposed by the twitching corpse of the Labour Party in a last, spiteful two-fingered gesture to its former voters.What don’t these MPs get  They bet the house on a “people’s vote” and lost. And yet they still witter on about second referendums, customs unions or otherwise tying ourselves to the EU.One voice seemed to speak sense. “We recognise the clear message from the public,” said Jeremy Corbyn. “We have to respect that and move on.”Then, ridiculously, he led his rabble through the lobby to vote against Brexit one last time.A historic day, with Labour yet again on the wrong side of it. And for Corbyn, a dismal end to his inglorious week of sullen silence and door-slamming petulance.WE’RE confused.One minute Corbyn takes responsibility for his defeat. The next he blames hostility from “billionaire Press barons”.He cannot grasp a simple reality about The Sun. If we fear a wannabe Government will wreck the economy and destroy our readers’ jobs, we oppose it.But the Left think anyone not devoted to socialist purity must have corrupt motives. And for these zealots the answer is an even more left-wing leader. Maybe contender Clive Lewis, who makes Corbyn look like Norman Tebbit.Unless they grow out of this, they will spend their lives in impotent opposition.IT is high time to end voter fraud, using compulsory photo ID. We are delighted the Tories aim to do it.The Left always protests it is so rare it is not worth the fuss. Whatever could they be worried about  Surely not that the poorest will be deprived of their vote, since photo IDs will be free. What other motive could they have There is a wealth of first-hand or anecdotal evidence of people voting multiple times in dferent constituencies, stealing someone ’s vote, voting by post AND in person and so on.Conviction rates are low only because the system is so wide open it is hard to spot and catch offenders.

It will have done the main thing that it was put in power to do within two months of taking office.The danger for the Tories is that their new electoral ­coalition was held together by a desire to Get Brexit Done and fear of Jeremy Corbyn, and both of those issues will soon be resolved.As the party’s campaign director, Isaac Levido, pointed out to Tory MPs on Wednesday afternoon, Brexit and Corbyn won this election for the Tories and both of them will be gone by the time of the next ­election, so the Tories have to deliver for their new voters or risk defeat.No  is acutely ­conscious of this risk. They know they need a new glue for their coalition — and fast.At Political Cabinet on Tuesday morning, this point was rammed home to ministers by both the PM and Levido.Levido, a clear-sighted Australian, warned the assembled secretaries of state that the Tories have “not won the domestic policy fight” yet.He stressed that this election had been about Getting Brexit Done more than any other issue.Tory support among Leave voters went from  per cent in  to  per cent, and that was key to the victory.Ministers were told that the party’s polling showed the positive things voters associated with the Tories were about sorting Brexit, while the negative things about Labour were to do with Corbyn or Brexit.Levido was clear that voters were backing the Tories to finish Brexit — not because they had suddenly become Conservatives. Another danger for the Tories is that Labour’s fundamental brand is nowhere near as damaged as many at Westminster think.With Corbyn gone and Brexit removed as an issue, the party may well be able to bounce back much faster than expected.Levido pointed out that the Tories’ own polling of  marginal seats had seen the gap between the two parties narrow to just four points in the aftermath of the manestos, as Labour briefly succeeded in turning the conversation away from Brexit.Boris Johnson and the Tory campaign pushed Brexit back to the top of the agenda.Levido was clear that for this reason the election could not be seen as a categorical rejection of Labour’s policies. The challenge for the Tories is to move fast to deliver change, so that people do not feel tempted to go back to Labour again.Do this right and, over the next decade, Darlington, West Bromwich and Wrexham will become Tory heartlands. Get it wrong and these places will turn red once again.Boris told cabinet ministers that voters needed to see and feel change in their local AE and on their roads and high streets.He said there needed to be a clear reduction in homelessness and voters must know that they and their family have a better chance of owning a home. This election made the Tories a national party again.Now they must show these new voters that their cares are Conservative concerns — and that the party knows how to fix the problems. They must deliver for the whole nation.WHERE is the geographical centre of the new Tory party  Well, before the election it was Buckinghamshire.Now it is South Yorkshire, where the Tories hold three seats – Rother Valley, Don Valley and Penistone And Stocksbridge.James Cleverly, the ebullient Tory chairman, has relished telling colleagues this fact. I understand that to reflect this new reality, the Tories are planning to move a large chunk of their party headquarters up north.The thinking is that by getting a chunk of the party operation out of London and into the North, it will make the party less London-centric and more attuned to the concerns of the rest of the country.BORIS JOHNSON is determined that next year must not be as dominated by Brexit as this year has been. He told Cabinet this week that once the UK leaves the EU on January , they should stop talking about Brexit.The PM argued that while the EU would try to create new clf edges and fresh moments of drama, the Government should resist being drawn into this dynamic.He argued that ministers should instead approach it as a normal trade negotiation rather than as some epoch-defining event.I am told that as part of the Government’s effort to de-dramatise things, they intend to resist going to Brussels for every negotiation – something which only adds to the tension and drama.I understand they want negotiations on both sides of the Channel rather than the UK always looking like a supplicant in heading to Europe to be told what it can and cannot have.As part of the effort to lower the profile of these trade talks, I am informed that David Frost – Boris’s understated but effective EU sherpa – will carry on conducting the negotiations.Frost, who is trusted totally by the PM and his inner circle, secured the changes to the withdrawal agreement that made it acceptable to Tory MPs. Having Frost conduct the negotiations rather than a cabinet minister will make them less likely to dominate the news.But there is no getting away from the importance of these talks to the UK. The deal will be the first trade deal the nation has done in -odd years and will be hugely important in determining the future economic direction of this country.The Tories calculate that, for his part, Sir Keir Starmer, the strongest Shadow Cabinet advocate of a second referendum, would deepen Labour’s problem in Leave-voting seats.The only candidate currently causing some concern is Jess Phillips – regarded as the high-risk, high-reward option for Labour.But given her low standing with the Corbyn-backing membership, she is not currently looking like a top- tier candidate.WHEN two or three ministers are gathered together, they start to nervously whisper about the February reshuffle.It is expected that this reshuffle will be big and coincide with the changes to Whitehall that Boris Johnson is keen to introduce. He wants to create some new departments, merge others and even shutter some.Boris’s old allies, though, are warning against a shake-up that sees too many of them replaced.One confidant of this group tells me Boris’s new support base in the party is “a mile wide and an inch deep” and that he needs to keep close those who have been loyal to him through thick and thin.One person who is certain to be rewarded in the reshuffle is Brandon Lewis, the Security Minister.Johnson’s team were impressed by his work during the campaign and want to use him more in the media.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Over the past  months, her husband Prince Philip had a police warning for his involvement in a car crash, her grandsons Princes William and Harry publicly fell out and her second son Prince Andrew got ever more entangled in his links to paedophile US financier Jeffrey Epstein. And now Philipaposs health has again come into question, after he was admitted to hospital on Friday aposfor a few daysapos.Of the year as a whole, royal biographer Penny Junor said: This is as bad as it gets for her. Twenty seven years ago the Queen used a speech at the Guildhall to describe her year as an annus horribilis. The year was wrecked by the collapse of three of her childrenaposs marriages - including Prince Charlesapos to Princess Diana - and the fire that severely damaged her Windsor Castle home. Ms Junor said: She obviously wonapost use that phrase again, but I would suspect in some ways thishas been even worse. Prince Philip car crash near Sandringham In January, Elizabethaposs -year-old husband Prince Philip was involved in a car accident near the familyaposs Sandringham estate. The Duke, , was miraculously unharmed other than a few bumps and scrapes. However he had to give up his driving licence after police gave him a warning for driving without wearing a seat belt.  Prince Andrewaposs links with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein The decision by Prince Andrew to take part in an interview with BBC Newsnight about his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein backfired spectacularly. Days after the grilling in Buckingham Palace the Duke of York was sidelined from his royal role with speculation he may never do public engagements again. The father-of-two was judged to have badly handled the questions by Emily Maitlis and even refused to say his friendship with Epstein, who died this year awaiting trial for further child sex trafficking charges, was a mistake.  The Duke has vehemently denied allegations he had sex with teenager Virginia Roberts but the backlash from the interview was swt and Prince Charles, who was in New Zealand at the time, is tipped to have had a hand in his ousting from a public role. Criticism of Meghan and Harry The Queenaposs grandson Prince Harry, rumoured to be her favourite, and his we Meghan have taken strong action against the press. The couple were criticised for renovating their Frogmore Cottage home using taxpayer money and also using a private jet while speaking out on climate change.  A documentary that was supposed to highlight their work on their South Africa tour instead focused on perceived negative media coverage of the couple and particularly of Meghan, who gave birth to her first son Archie in May. Meghan spoke on the documentary about the intense toll the unfair media coverage has taken on her well-being. Harry also spoke about his mental health struggles. I thought I was out of the woods and then suddenly it all came back, and then suddenly I realized no, this is something that I have to manage, Harry said.  Part of this job, and part of any job like everybody, means putting on a brave face and turning a cheek to a lot of the stuff. But again, for me and for my we, of course there’s a lot of stuff that hurts, especially when the majority of it is untrue. Rumours of a rt between brothers Harry and William Gossip from royal insiders continued to suggest throughout  that a rt had developed between Prince William and his brother Prince Harry. In that same documentary on the Sussexaposs tour of South Africa Harry was asked directly about them and didnapost deny it out of hand.  Part of this role and part of this job and this family, being under the pressure that it’s under — inevitably, you know, stuff happens. But look, we’re brothers, we’ll always be brothers, he said. We’re certainly on dferent paths at the moment, but I’ll always be there for him and as I know he’ll always be there for me. We donapost see each other as much as we used to because we’re so busy, but, you know, I love him dearly and the majority of the stuff is probably — well the majority of the stuff is created out of nothing. As brothers, you know, you have good days, you have bad days. Queen dragged into political row The Queen herself was embroiled in political wrangling over Britainaposs exit from the European Union, with her suspension of parliament in September at the behest of Prime Minister Boris Johnson ruled unlawful by the countryaposs top court. The royal family always go to great s to keep themselves away from the political arena but the Queen, unwittingly, played a part in the autumn Brexit fiasco with the Supreme Court judging that she was lied to about the reasons for prorogation.  Royal historian Robert Lacey said Septemberaposs Supreme Court ruling was more signicant than Prince Andrewaposs interview with it possibly heralding the end of the monarchyaposs few remaining prerogative powers and posing questions about its future constitutional role. It could reduce the monarch to an essentially ceremonial and charitable role, he said. The new involvement of the Supreme Court doesnapost question the existence of the monarchy - yet. Butcertain decisions and prerogatives are going to be controlled or taken away, then what has the prime minister got to go to speak to the queen about each week  Queen rises above scandals Most people will look upon  as not a particularly good year for the institution but the Queen came out pretty well, said Dickie Arbiter, Elizabethaposs press secretary from  to . The monarchy has evolved over , years. It has had all sorts of circumstances running against it, but it has survived. It survived , it survived the abdication of, it survived .  Some have gone as far as saying the family could eventually emerge even stronger - and that this yearaposs traumas could lay the foundations of a new slimmed-down monarchy, a long-term aim of future king Prince Charles. Royal historian Robert Lacey said: Itaposs a tragedy in a way, but it is a plus to see Charles playing a positive role in events. After  years, Charles is finally getting his way. One of those whose support they can count on is the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, spiritual leader of the worldaposs  million Anglicans.

Poor Rex has been in RSPCA kennels for  days and is desperate to find his paw-fect forever home in time for December . The four-year-old lurcher loves nothing more than a long walk with his family and is described as a lovely and friendly lad. An RSPCA spokesman said: Four-year-old lurcher Rex is facing his second Christmas in kennels. This lovely, friendly lad has been with the RSPCA for a staggering  days and is desperate to find the paw-fect home this Christmas. He’s a lively pooch who enjoys long walks and would love to find an active family to take him on. He’d benefit from some further training and he loves learning new things. This sensitive lad has a few allergies and has a special diet. He’d like to be the only pet but could live with a family with older children. And Rex isnapost the only furry friend desperate for a new home this festive season. Lurcher Cecil is also facing the prospect of his second Christmas in RSPCA care after spending more than half his le waiting for a new home. The two-year-old was found by the RSPCA as a stray and finds le in the kennel dficult. A spokesman said: He’s a wonderful dog, funny and sweet. He’s loyal and happy, gentle and quirky. He loves a fuss and is incredibly bright, learning new trick really quickly. Cecil needs experienced owners and would like an adult-only home. Hope the horse has spent a staggering , days in the RSPCAaposs care. She was rescued by RSPCA inspectors when she was just a foal in . Hope, a thoroughbred, was just hours from death and was too weak to stand. But since then sheaposs made an incredible recovery and staff are at a loss as to why she hasnapost been re-homed. A spokesman said: She may be able to be ridden in the future or could be a companion horse. She’s incredibly friendly, loves attention, enjoys being groomed and would be great for in-hand work. Three-year-old bunnies Tigger and Destiny were brought into the RSPCAaposs care  days ago. After living as house rabbits they would need an indoor home. A spokesman said: They enjoy sitting on laps and taking treats but would benefit from a quiet home. They’re happy being handled for a short time but can be grumpyover-handled so they would be best suited to an adult home where they’ll have time to settle and grow in confidence. Mum and daughter guinea pigs Isadora and Isabella a have spent a whopping  days in care and their only Christmas wish is for a safe home she can call her own. Isadora was rescued by the RSPCA in March when she was heavily pregnant - but she had a devastating birth.  A spokesman said: She had a dficult birth which actually saw her lose the use of her back legs but lots of vet visits and physio means she has now regained her movement. Isadora gave birth to five babies but sadly two of them were stillborn. The others were rehomed but Isadora and her younger daughter Isabella get along so well it was decided they would like to be rehomed together.

Paul Brown deceived the women into believing they could be glamour or adult starsthey stripped off or joined him in casting couch sex sessions. He set up a bogus modelling agency which he pretended had nothing to do with him and which he actually controlled and used to manipulate the victims. The models thought the agency was genuine and could find them work but onlythey went for apostest shootsapos at his studio in Okehampton, where he operated under the  name of Paul D Smart. Brown invented two fictional women, who supposedly ran the Models South West agency. Brown, through the agency contacted many of the victims of Facebook, told them they had the potential to be models, and inviting them to the studio.  Once they were there, he persuaded some to have sex with him on camera and others to strip for what he called aposartistic nudeapos sessions where he in fact focussed his camera on their private parts. The rape victims were told they could earn large amounts by posing for a type of pornography called POV or point of view, in which the participants film themselves having sex. They all thought the material would be sent to the agency Model South West, which would find them work. In reality, the agency was a sham and Brown kept the images for his own sexual gratication. Some of the models who had sex with him were lured back to his studio on the Fatherford Farm trading estate in Okehampton by messages from the modelling agency saying the scenes had to be re-shot. One model who was reluctant to strip naked heard Brown call Model South West and pretend to have a conversation with the agency about how she was ideal for nude work. The models came from all over Devon and were of all ages and sizes, ranging from their late teens to their s, Many were vulnerable and insecure about their bodies and were fooled by Brownaposs smooth talking and flattery. None of them ever received any offers of work and none of them received any of the money which he promised would follow. Brown kept a record of his sexual conquests in a aposblack bookapos which recorded details of some of the rape victims. The book contained the names, ages, physical details of Brownaposs partners and included a mark out of ten for their performance. The book even included his own we, who scored nine out of ten. The whole set up with the agency was a device to con women into satisfying his sexual appetite, which was described as sleazy and sordid by the prosecution. Brown joked with police in one interview that he was not Harvey Weinstein but employed a classic casting couch technique of offering fame and fortune in exchange for sex. The couch actually came from Ikea. He set himself up as a photographer despite having little formal training and a background as an IT adviser, at one stage working for the NHS in Exeter. Brown committed the offences while running his studio at the Fatherford Farm trading estate in Okehampton between  and . The police were first alerted in  by one of the rape victims who went to a genuine modelling shoot with a professional photographer a few days afterwards.  She realised that what Brown had done amounted to a sexual assault and went to the police, who arrested him and seized the black book. He carried on in exactly the same way while he was being investigated by police and went on to rape another two women. Brown was found guilty of  out of  charges including  rapes against six dferent women. He was also found guilty of voyeurism against five other women. He pleaded guilty to one count of voyeurism, which involved him installing a hidden camera at his home to spy on a young female visitor in the bathroom. He was cleared of four counts of sexual assault, which alleged that he touched models while rubbing oil onto their bodies during shoots. Brown, aged , of Okehampton, denied a total of  rapes against seven women, four of sexual assault against four women, and six of voyeurism against six women. He said all the women consented to what he did, in many cases in advance and in writing. He was found guilty of  rapes and five counts of voyeurism and remanded in custody by Judge David Evans, who adjourned sentence until February. He put Brown on the sex offenders register and ordered the probation service to prepare a report of whether Brown is a dangerous offender. He told him:You have been convicted of many of these serious offences and in due course you will be sentenced to a signicant time in custody. The appropriate time will only be decided in the light of the relevant material.

Amaani Noor, , who had planned to join her Islamist fighter husband in Syria, has been found guilty of fundraising for terrorism. She was wooed online by aposHakim My Loveapos and told him Itaposs been my dream to marry a fighter for a long time and my dream to be a fighter myself even longer. She also communicated with mum-of-two Victoria Webster, , and accessed video footage showing torture, beheadings and people being set on fire which the judge described as truly shocking. Webster was also sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court today. Noor, of Cinema Drive in Wavertree, Liverpool, had claimed she believed  dollars, around £, she donated to the Mercul Hands organisation on May  last year would go to buy food for women and children in Syria. But earlier this month a jury found her guilty of fundraising contrary to the Terrorism Act . Webster, of Pine Street in Nelson, Lancashire, was jailed for  months after she pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to two counts of providing money for the purposes of terrorism and one count of inviting another to provide money for the purposes of terrorism. Serena Gates, prosecuting, said Webster donated a total of about £ in a series of small amounts. Both women were in tears as they were told they would be jailed. Sentencing Noor, honorary recorder of Liverpool Judge Andrew Menary QC rejected the claim that the former performing arts student had set up a PayPal account in a fake name because of considerations of modesty. He said: I donapost accept simply that you are that modest or naive in the way you would like people to believe.  I have no doubt your commitment to your religion is entirely genuine but sadly there is a cunning about you which you maintained during your evidence. During the trial, the jury heard Noor, a former Miss Teen GB semi-finalist, and Webster messaged using the Telegram app and spoke about extremist groups including so-called Islamic State . They had access to video footage showing torture, beheadings and people being set on fire which the judge described as truly shocking. Noor, who wore a black hijab, also used the app to message a man named Hakim My Love who, she told the court, she had married over videolink and who described himself as an independent fighter in Syria.  On the day officers searched her house, in July , she had a ticket booked to travel to Turkey. The court was read emails found on a phone seized by police, believed to be written by Noor to Hakim, which said: Itaposs been my dream to marry a fighter for a long time and my dream to be a fighter myself even longer lol. The jury was told Noor had been in a relationship with a professional footballer when she was a teenager and also had a short marriage to a preacher. The player was not named, but Noor dated Sheyi Ojo who is currently on loan at Rangers.  David Gottlieb, defending, suggested her failed relationships may have led to the offences and sent her spinning out of the solar system. He said she was in a new relationship and her fiance was in court along with her brother and mother. Mr Gottlieb said: She needs to address issues of self-esteem and making relationships. Hossein Zahir, defending Webster, who wore a pink niqab, said she was on a path to reform. He added: The ideology she thought she believed in has left her le in ruins. He said she was influenced by Kamran Awan, who was connected to the Mercul Hands, and had been cynically used by him.

The couple have always been very tactile but their touch and eye contact rituals show no sign of diminishing, meaning their body language rituals seem to place them in an on-going ‘Honeymoon phase’ of their relationship. This means they appear to want to illustrate and act out their love in public. This is the kind of exclusivity and intimacy rituals that can make other people feel excluded around them. It’s hard to see how a couple so openly in love could cause any offence but presumably the dinner party set expect open and active sociability rather than a couple appearing to send affectionate tie-signs to one another that suggest they are carrying on some secret and often flirty silent conversations in public. aposFlirty and playful Meghan’s few appearances since Archie was born seem to register an increase of these intimacy ‘in love’ signals that involve even more mutual eye-gazing and celebratory smiles to suggest their relationship has intensied with their new role as parents. In this photothese very flirty and playful signals show a mutually tactile couple keen to share jokes and silent communication. Harry looks very protective here and Meghan flatters him by looking down and laughing as they wind their arms round one another’s waists and lean in together. aposBonding and touch are important, especially to Meghanapos  This pose suggests a more open sociability, with both smiling outward and looking relaxed. These smiles look prompted by the cameras and audience rather than just one another, which would normally be a stage a couple deeply in love would go through as they move out of the obsessional, passionate stage and into something more relaxed, happy and confident. The entwined hands show how important bonding and touch are to the couple, especially to Meghan, who placed her right hand onto their clasped hands to make the loving connection gesture even more emphatic. aposThey are lost to the worldapos  In this image Harry and Meghan turned this simple, congratulatory kiss at polo into a romantic and intimate moment. Meghan threw her head back, baring her neck and the couple used mutual eye gaze to suggest they were lost to the world at that moment. This could have just been a smiling kiss on the cheek but the couple appeared to want to use the moment to reinforce their love for one another. aposTheir bonds are stronger than everaposIn both these photos there’s no change in their tie-signs now Archie has been born, with the linked hands and the excited-looking smiles suggesting their bonds might be stronger than ever. The romance comes from the way Harry gazes adoringly at Meghan and their pinging smiles seem to bounce off one another. aposMeghan gazing up adoringly at Harryapos "},{"url":null,"title":"harry meghan wedding photographer opens","story":"NewsHarry and Meghan wedding photographer opens up on strict rules for their portraitsAlexi Lubomirski has spoken about what it was like to photograph the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at their wedding at Windsor Castle in May ShareCommentsByTom DavidsonSenior Reporter:,  DEC NewsAn official wedding photo taken by Alexi Lubomirski and released by the royal couple \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - Royal FamilySubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

In one photo, the Duke and Duchess can be seen smiling as they pose up on some steps. Alexi had just three minutes to capture the moment.  He said: The Palace official was looking at me saying weaposre going to have to turn around soon and I was like okay, okay just sit down on these stairs. aposAnd they literally just sort of slumped down, laughing. Sort of looking at each other going oh my god, weaposre married.apos Alexi says he burst into tears after the shoot - down to both relief and also because he was pleased with the photos. He added the couple were so aposnatural on camera,apos that despite having just  minutes to capture six dferent set-ups, the photos all achieved a aposrelaxed, organic feel.apos Alexi is a firm favorite with celebrities, and has shot cover stars such as Angelina Jolie , Julianne Moore, Beyonce , Demi Moore, Charlize Theron, Natalie Portman, Jenner Lopez, Selma Hayek, Katy Perry, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jenner Aniston, Emilia Clarke, Julia Roberts, Nicole Kidman and Scarlett Johansson.The Duke and Duchess have been introducing their baby son Archie to the warmth of the Canadian people and the beauty of the countryaposs landscape, a spokeswoman for the couple said today.

And  seems to be no dferent with revellers in Newcastle, Leeds, Cardf and Manchester enjoying a night on the tiles before Christmas next week. This year Sheffield city centre sergeant Jon Simpson warned people not to spend their festive season behind bars due to their antics on what is also referred to as aposBlack Eye Fridayapos. He said: Make sure youaposve got a plan for getting home and donapost put yourself in a position where you make yourself vulnerable and potentially end up a victim of crime. You also donapost want to commit crime and end up in a police cell over the Christmas period.In party-mad Newcastle one woman in a short snake-skin mini-skirt decided to perform a handstand against a tree and the same woman, in the party spirit, was also pictured on a manaposs shoulders mimicking flying through the air. The woman appeared to be keen to get everyone in the festive mood, at one stage dancing in the streets with a man in a pink cowboy hat on her shoulders. A game effort by another woman enjoying a night out appeared to end in failure. But not all the action on Tyneside was in the party spirit with two young men appearing to square up to one another in the street, with one grabbing the other by the throat as friends urge them to calm down. One group of male revellers were all wearing the iconic Ash Ketchum Pokemon hat - but one of their number was wearing an inflatable Pikachu suit. Also in the Welsh capital one man was wrestled to the ground by door staff outside Popworld on St Maryaposs Street. The cold winter air was not enough to dissuade one male reveller from dancing topless to a saxophone busker, also on St Maryaposs Street which is one of the busiest areas for nightle in the city. In Manchester one man dressed in an inflatable turkey had a clash with a friend before resting against a wall.  Likewise in Leeds there was fancy dress on Friday, albeit with more of a festive theme. But where in the city centre two men were pictured getting into a scrap on the road before a police officer intervened. Neither is thought to have been seriously hurt.  In a quieter scene one man, in fancy dress to look like Santa was carrying him on his shoulders, sat at a bus station in Leeds, scrolling through his phone and supping from a hip flask. Superintendent Chris Hill, who leads on Policing in the Night Time Economy at Greater Manchester Police, said Mancunians said before Fridayaposs natics that revellers will see more officers around on Mad Friday. We always plan ahead for Christmas and New Year, working alongside other emergency services and partners to ensure we have a well-rounded plan in place, he said.  We expect to welcome large numbers of persons over these periods. The Christmas Markets, planned events at the numerous sporting and music arenas, office Christmas parties and fireworks on NYE all add extra footfall to the already busy City centre. Sean Joyce, Head of Regulatory and Criminal Justice at Stephensons Solicitors LLP, called Mad Friday one of the most notorious drinking days of the year.  Itaposs the culmination of the working year and a time when every workplace up and down the country wants to let their hair down and celebrate the Christmas break, he said. However, a night of drinking can cause alcohol fuelled problems and some workers can become easily riled and aggressive, which can lead to arguments with colleagues or strangers.

The woman - given the pseudonym Maryam - lives in cramped temporary accommodation after escaping months of trauma and upset at home.The family of seven are awaiting a suitable place to rent but Birmingham City Council has housed the family in a BB only meant for short-stays, Birmingham Live reports. The grizzly situation for this family of seven is not isolated.  They are among a staggering  kids spending the run-up to Christmas in a BB or hotel room in the city. Most will still be there on Christmas Day, and the prospect of a turkey dinner and an excess of treats is remote and presents are likely to be in short supply. When Maryam’s children were asked what they wanted for Christmas their answer was humbling. Her youngest child, a three year old, said he wanted “yoghurt and some colours”. Meanwhile, his -year-old brother wants stationary for school. He said: “I’d like a book to help me with my SATS - and I wish for Airpods.  Maryam has endured a traumatic seven weeks after fleeing the family home in October. The family has since lived in a BB, with mum trying to keep a semblance of normal le going for the kids, aged three to . Thankfully, the situation facing this family is about to improve, after a last minute intervention from Birmingham City Council. They could be out of the BB by Monday afternoon. A brief message from the council read: A move to more suitable self-contained accommodation has been arranged for next Monday .  But for  other families, including  kids, Christmas Day will be spent in a Birmingham BB room. Most of them will have been there for several weeks at a time, living in a space suitable for short stays, not miserable months. It is a dark and stark sign of a city in the grip of the national housing crisis, with a drastic shortage of council homes and affordable private properties for rent. Birmingham City Council is trying to stem the tide of need but itaposs a struggle, and the number of kids caught up in the crisis just keeps going up. Maryam, , left the family home in a hurry in the autumn with her six children, aged three to . It was the culmination of months of trauma and upset, and she sought support from Birmingham City Council, Womenaposs Aid and her childrenaposs schools.  I told the council what had been happening, and spoke to Womenaposs Aid and the police for help, she said. The council first said they could not do anything to help with a house because we are a big family, so they could not give us suitable accommodation, they had nothing for us. She spent a couple of nights with a friend - her family of seven, and her friendaposs family of ten, crammed into a small house. The family were then housed in a Travelodge and, later, sent to the BB where they have been living since October . Thereaposs nowhere for the kids to play, no garden to run around in, no desk for homework, no table to eat at and no privacy.  The children have broken up from school for the holidays, and Maryam said she was uncertain how often she would be able to feed them. They usually have breakfast and lunch at school, and in the evenings they mostly rely on fast, hot food from cheap takeaways or supermarkets, she said. The little nine year old is very underweight - a letter from a health visitor, expressing concern at how desperate the familyaposs situation is and the impact on their health, is among a pile of supporting documents pressing the city council to move the family out of the BB. The bundle also includes a letter from the familyaposs GP, which says Maryam has type  diabetes, chronic back pain and anxiety and that one of the children is on nutritional supplements to boost her weight.  Mum Maryam used to work in a nursery school but has had to stop work since becoming homeless and ending up in the BB. She has managed to keep the family car on the road - without it, thereaposs no chance the children would be able to continue at the schools they love. But the running costs are an extra strain. Mum Maryam says one of her ladaposs school performance has dropped since the turmoil of the family breakup: His reading is not good but he is very bright, but there is nowhere quiet for him or any of the children to study or think. It is hard for him.  Saidul Haque Saeed, lead organiser for Citizens UK in Birmingham, and his organisation has been supporting Maryam since her plight came to their attention, and they have been advocating on her behalf for an urgent move into a permanent home. We are seeing so many cases like this, all over Birmingham. It is a shocking state of affairs, a real scandal, driven by a lack of social housing and a lack of affordable private rented accommodation. The system is broken in the city. He has also drawn together a multi-cultural, multi-faith group of campaigners who have now started to lobby the city council, the West Midlands Combined Authority and the Government on social housing provision. There are simply too few places in the city for families in dficulty to find security and peace, he says.  In early , the number of households - including families - sent to BBs was close to . Many were being sent out of the city, tearing them away from any support networks and schools. The cityaposs Cabinet member responsible for homelessness, Coun Sharon Thompson, took over the portfolio in May  and pledged to bring that number down drastically. She recognises that a BB room is no place for a family and has pledged to bring the number down to zero. By this time last year that figure had nearly halved, with  households of all sizes living in BBs, including  families and  children. But in the past year progress has stalled, despite a series of new measures.  At the start of this week, the number of affected families has reduced slightly to  - but the number of children caught up in the crisis has rocketed to . Many of the families affected are large, and the current housing stock is just not able to cope. The stubbornly static number of affected families comes despite concerted efforts all year by the council to deal with demand. But no sooner is one family helped than more arrive seeking support. The council is currently seeing  new families every month - enough to fill four tower blocks. The Homelessness Reduction Act, introduced earlier this year, has made it easier for people to get help and is designed to ensure people are supported earlier, with a focus on preventing them becoming homeless in the first place.

Darryn was among brave members of the public who fought convicted terrorist Khan as he lunged at people with knives. Footage from November  shows Darryn wielding the tusk on London Bridge. He is seen pinning Khan to the ground and being pulled away by an armed police officer before the fiend – who was wearing a fake suicide vest – is shot dead. Tragically, by the time he was stopped he had killed Jack Merritt, , and Saskia Jones, . Darryn was at the same prisoner rehabilitation event in Fishmongers’ Hall at London Bridge, Central London, as Khan when the maniac launched his attack. Recalling how the horror unfolded, he said: “When we heard the noise from the floor below, a few of us rushed to the scene. I took a narwhal tusk from the wall and used it to defend myself and others from the attacker. Another man was holding him at bay with a wooden chair. “I ran down the stairs, stood next to the man with the chair, and the two of us confronted the attacker.“He had knives in both hands and, upon seeing me with the narwhal tusk, indicated he had an explosive device around hiswaist.The man next to me threw his chair at the attacker, who then started running towards him.”  Darryn, , passed the tusk to the man before racing to grab another one. When he ed, he saw the first tusk “shattered across the floor” and people fleeing. He said: “Along with others, I pursued the attacker, tusk in hand, on to the bridge. We called out to warn the public and managed to restrain him to the ground.” One of the heroes Darryn fought with was reformed ex-prisoner John Crilly, who sprayed Khan with a fire extinguisher after seeing his suicide vest.  The -year-old helped to push Khan back from ­Fishmongers’ Hall and told the Mirror days after the drama: “I keep spraying him, he can’t see and that gives the whale guy a chance to give him a poke.” Darryn, a South African who has lived in London for  years, said he had omitted “many details” in his account, “out of respect for the victims and their families” and due to the ongoing probe and inquests. But he said he wanted to speak out to help tackle terrorism and raise cash for the families Khan has devastated. And he added: I feel we all have a duty to ­challenge the spread of fear, hatred or intolerance within our communities. I hope the part I played in these terrible events can be used for good. Offering his condolences to Jack and Saskia’s loved ones, he said: “I am convinced they represent all that is good in the world and I will always feel the deep hurt of not being able to save them.”  Darryn also praised the people Khan wounded for being “so brave” – saying some refused treatment until others who were more seriously hurt were tended to first. He added: “That consideration and kindness filled me with hope on that dark day. And Darryn said he was “eternally grateful” to the people who helped, adding: “Not only do I want to thank those who confronted the attacker but also those who put themselves in danger to tend to the injured, relying on us to protect them while they cared for others.”Darryn, who works in the Ministry of Justice communications department, is now urging people to “challenge hate and spread kindness” by backing his peace project, Extinguish Hate. He is also asking people to donate to fundraising pages for the victims, at saskia-jones.muchloved and Celebration Of The Le Of Jack Merritt on GoFundMe. Khan, of Stafford, was arrested in December  and jailed in  for terror offences. He did two rehabilitation courses before his release in December .

The -year-old will spend “a few days” on a private ward after being admitted as a precaution on a doctor’s advice because of an existing condition. But Palace aides dispelled any fears Philip suffered an ­emergency, insisting he did not need an ambulance to take him from Sandringham in Norfolk to King Edward VII Hospital, Central London, where he walked in “unaided”. Prince Philip was flown by helicopter from the Sandringham Estate to London. He was then driven to the hospital in Marylebone. The Queen went ahead with her plans to travel to the royal estate ahead of the Christmas holidays, where she will be joined by close family including son Prince Charles.  A statement from the Palace said: “The Duke of Edinburgh travelled from Norfolk this morning to the King Edward VII Hospital in London for observation and treatment in relation to a pre-existing condition. The admission is a precautionary measure, on the advice of His Royal Highness’ Doctor.” It is understood that the Duke was flown to hospital by helicopter from Sandringham to London and then driven to the hospital. Royal expert Ingrid Seward told how Philip and his -year-old we are used to spending time away from each other. The Majesty Magazine editor-in-chief said: “Philip has always been renowned for being as tough as an ox and ­incredibly active throughout his le. “It is no surprise the Queen has carried on with her Sandringham plans while he is in hospital. “Since the early days of their marriage when he was still serving in the Royal Navy they were used to spending large amounts of time apart and have always managed to be very independent of each other while remaining incredibly supporting of one another.”  The Queen caught the .am Great Northern service from King’s Cross station in London and arrived in King’s Lynn at .pm to begin the first day of her Christmas retreat. She is ­understood to have spoken to her husband before he was admitted and is being kept informed of how he is doing. Palace sources said it was unclear when the Duke would be discharged. The royals will be seen going to church on Christmas Day by locals who gather to catch a glimpse of them. Philip was last seen out in public at Balmoral in August. He has suffered a string of health scares in recent years.  In June , he was admitted to hospital with an infection. The Duke missed the State Opening of Parliament, with the Prince of Wales stepping in to ­accompany the Queen. Last year he was in for  days after a hip replacement. In , the duke had “an exploratory operation” on his abdomen. A year earlier, he missed the majority of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee ­celebrations after falling ill with a bladder ­infection.

Ethical vegan Jordi Casamitjana only dates other vegans, doesnapost sit on leather sofas and doesnapost allow guests carrying animal products into his home. The campaigner is launching a landmark case in an attempt to get ethical veganism added to a list of protected characteristics enshrined in equalities law, in a bid to officially protect vegans from aposdiscriminationapos. The Mirror can today reveal his legal team plans to compare veganism to religious evangelism as one of its key arguments planned for the two-day employment tribunal pre-hearing on January . Mr Casmitjana plans to argue that the vegan movementaposs tendency to try to convert more people to the lestyle means it should be legally recognised as a aposphilosophy and belief systemapos. He will even produce receipts for vegan shoes and aftershave in court in his bid to argue that veganism is not just a diet- but a belief shared by a growing number of people in the UK. The trained zoologist is originally from Catalonia, but has lived in the UK for  years, and has had a long career in animal protection. He identies as an aposethical veganapos. Dietary vegans and ethical vegans both eat a plant-based diet, but ethical vegans also try to avoid any animal exploitation, such as by shunning clothing made of wool or leather and not using products tested on animals. Mr Casamitjanaaposs legal battle began last year after he was sacked from his job with the League Against Cruel Sports after disclosing to other employees that its pension funds invested in firms involved in animal testing. He claims he was sacked as a result of his ethical vegan beliefs. But the organisation has rejected his claims, previously telling the BBC he was dismissed for gross misconduct. The allegations will be dealt with separately in another employment tribunal hearing later next year. A spokesperson told the Mirror: “The League Against Cruel Sports is an inclusive employer and as this is a hearing to decide whether veganism should be a protected status, something which the League does not contest, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.”  Veganism aposlike a religionapos Vegan activists and legal eagles are closely watching the case, sayingMr Casamitjanaaposs wins it could set a signicant precedent.  But some commentators worryhe wins his case, it could open up the floodgates to other lestyles receiving legal protections that could have a aposchilling effectapos on free speech in the UKaposs workplaces. Mr Casamitjanaaposs key argument is that veganism should be treated as a belief because it reaches into every aspect of his le, and is a lestyle shared by a growing number of Brits. His legal team will present philosophical statements arguing that veganism is morally necessary. It will also all argue that the value he and other activists value place in persuading others to become vegan to increase followers of the lestyle cements its status as a belief system- not just a dietary or consumer choice. His side will also argue the world is becoming increasingly aware and accommodating of vegans.  Mr Casamitjana told the Mirror: “Currently many vegans feel discriminated against, despite the growth of the movement. “If I am successful I hope it will make other vegans feel more confident expressing their beliefs and helping raise awareness for other people to consider this way of living and ensure all ethical vegans are better protected from discrimination. The impact of securing legal protection for ethical vegans in the UK is likely to generate ripples in other countries, potentially sparking new legal protection for vegans where.  “This can only have a positive impact on animals, the environment and public health. Veganism a growing trend The case comes as veganismaposs popularity rises, with the number of consumers around the UK following a plant-based diet quadrupling between  to .  Marketers have leapt on the growing trend, with the range of vegan products on offer in supermarkets and eateries booming nationwide in recent years. According to the Vegan Society, , people in the UK identied as vegans this year- amounting to . per cent of the population - and up from , people in . The society said it is not just vegans driving the change, as supermarkets and restaurants race to cater to the one in three Brits who say they have consciously cut down on meat, dairy and eggs.  The society is backing Mr Casamitjana, whose crowdfunding campaign for his legal battle had reached nearly £, this week. Spokeswoman Dominika Piasecka said: “While veganism clearly meets the requirements for being considered a philosophical belief protected under the Equality Act , this has not been proven in court yet.  “We are eagerly awaiting the outcome of next year’s hearing which we expect will favourably clary the legal status of veganism. “This isn’t of course just about the rights of vegans a society that respects veganism and accommodates vegans also gives expression to the undisputed moral standing and rights of non-human animals.” What is a protected characteristic  The Equalities Act  protects people from discrimination and harassment in their workplace, and when they are using private or public services, on the basis of any of nine protected characteristics. They are: age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation. Mr Casamitjanaaposs lawyer Peter Daly, of Slater and Gordon called it a ground breaking case. This case is important not only for Jordi, but the wider vegan community in the UK and globally.  Ethical Veganism is a whole philosophy which guides all of Jordi’s choices from the products he buys, to the transportation he uses and where he invests his money.  We are hoping this hearing will support our view in Jordi’s belief system as similar to a religion and a special characteristic deserving of protection. A aposslippery slopeapos The tribunal will have to decide whether veganism, like religion, meets a series of thresholds that would see it treated as a philosophical belief worthy of protection under the Equality Act .  Nick Spencer, a senior fellow at thinktank Theos, commended Mr Casamitjana for his commitment to his ethical beliefs, but worriedhe wins his case it could transform a moral issue into a legal one. He labelled the case a “slippery slope.” “The concern is that it could have a chilling effectyou’re running a workplace and you have a vegan there you could be very cautious, very concerned that anything you did or say or opinion you gave -they took offence - it could become a legal issue.

Footage shows Liam Cornett cruising around in flashy cars and playing with money during a luxury holiday to the state. The -year-old, nicknamed ‘the Lam’, flew in a helicopter and drove around Monte Carlo in a convertible Bentley with his right hand man Michael Rice, Liverpool Echo reports. Cornett - who exploited vulnerable people to sell drugs - has been jailed for  years today. He was sentenced along with  other offenders involved in a large-scale drug dealing network. Cornett ran the network along with Micheal Rice, , from Liverpool and Kieran Eves, , from Hale, who were jailed for  years and  years respectively. Cornett and Rice funded their lavish lestyle via the massive drugs operation they oversaw. Cornett, who had a home in Huyton, controlled the importation of cocaine, heroin and amphetamines into the UK. Rice oversaw the day-to-day operation on the ground, controlling drugs from their arrival in England to the distribution of the substances and sales all the way down to the streets of Anfield, Hull and Exeter. Riceaposs sentence was added to a six year term already handed out for possession of a handgun.Cornett was described as a “constant thorn in the communities of Merseyside” at an intelligence briefing before his allies were targeted in dawn raids across the UK. Dozens of Merseyside Police officers listened as the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit detailed the targets of Operation Valkyrie in December . Most already knew his name. As he climbed the criminal hierarchy, Cornett’s identity became entwined with the exploits of Liverpool’s underworld. Cornett, who bought a home on Roby Road in Huyton, clocked up a record of dishonesty offences as a teenager before being jailed for affray in .  Yet it was his activity abroad that saw him climb to become one of the most signicant players in the latest generation of Merseyside’s criminal fraternity. In , Cornett was jailed in the Netherlands for crimes that effectively equated to attempted murder, threats to kill and causing grievous bodily harm. The convictions arose from an incident in which he drove at a police officer. The attack was not publicised because Dutch courts do not name defendants. But it was known in police and criminal circles on Merseyside - as was the three year sentence he received.  Cornett eventually based himself in Spain, where he made contacts that gave him to access drugs there and in North Africa. He then organised their importation into the UK and the Netherlands. When he was questioned over the investigation that led to him being jailed this week, he did not deny he was a drug dealer - he instead argued the drug lines he oversaw related to cannabis, not Class A substances. At Cornett’s sentencing hearing in Liverpool Crown Court, Henry Riding, prosecuting, said: “Liam Cornett has a home in Spain. It is common ground that for a number of years he has been involved in criminal activity in Spain, including the organisation of importations of controlled drugs into the UK and Holland from Spain and North Africa. “His evidence was that it was exclusively Class B drugs and that he organised importations both for his own operations and on behalf of other organised crime groups.”  He was not charged in relation to any cannabis conspiracy but Mr Riding said the claims were relevant because they confirmed “he is a sophisticated and experienced criminal who is well-versed in the techniques of drug supply”. The December  raids that shattered his network were the climax of Operation Anvil, which had begun in the summer of , when Cornett was living on the Costa del Sol. By this stage the drug supply lines he controlled in Liverpool. The profits funded a playboy lestyle that saw him in party in one of the world’s most glamorous playgrounds - Monte Carlo, where he flew in a helicopter, rode in a convertible Bentley and was filmed throwing wads of cash in the air. That holiday on the Mediterranean took place in the summer of  and during the opening months of Operation Anvil.  Not content with the huge sums already available to him, around the same time he made extensive efforts to expand his network. In August, September  - apart from the Monte Carlo trip - and October of that year Cornett spent much of his time in the UK plotting new hubs for his enterprise to exploit. First Cardf, where the gang sent amphetamines, then Exeter, where the Liverpool outfit simply took over the local trade and Plymouth, where they teamed up with a prominent local enforcer to sell cocaine and heroin. Cornett would travel to meetings between top-level associates as he agreed the terms under which he would supply his drugs.  Often, detectives tracked lower-ranking figures of his as they travelled separately, sometimes, by train, carrying samples used to entice prospective gangland partners. Once established, Cornett would play a hands-off role on the operations, allowing trusted associates to control the graft phone lines used by addicts to order their fix. From June  to August  the phone number that controlled the Liverpool dealing operation received , calls. From May to July  the Hull line received , calls and in Exeter the phone number received , calls in its first week alone. Detectives from NWROCU teamed up with those from forces on the south coast to bring Cornett down. Undercover police officers posing as drug users captured details about how the gang worked on the ground. Meanwhile, a massive surveillance operation captured snapshots of the gang’s exploits.  In the summer of , Cornett spent nine days in a Dutch prison after ing to the country for a music event and being picked out as an “undesirable alien”. Calls from jail made to his right hand man, Michael Rice, were recorded and revealed him ordering for the network to “stand still”. In November  one of his contacts had his suitcase searched ahead of a flight from John Lennon Airport to Spain. Inside was £,, thought to be destined for Cornett.

It’s the most depressed we’ve felt about any other election in our letime. I’m not going to go on about it because I know everyone has had enough and I know a lot of you are still like me - in mourning at the loss of our beacon of hope. The one and only Jeremy Corbyn. So what do we do when we’re sad  We listen to music, we sing, we dance and we get nominated as a BBC One Show Christmas Angel. What thaaaaa  My lovely Michael Brown had been in touch with an absolute angel at the BBC named Olivia. The two of them schemed together and off I went to London, not having a clue about what was going on. We arrived at London Zoo and we were shown around by Ben, the elf, who eventually led us to Michelle Visage. She was an absolute dreamboat and Ivy fell madly in love with her - she even said to her aposAunty Michelle, I love you more than I love my Mummyapos, little sod. Afterwards, we had to get glammed up for our next surprise - tickets to the Nativity at the Hammersmith Apollo. What an absolutely incredible show. Music, singing, dancing and laughter. The buzz in the theatre was contagious. We got to go backstage afterwards and met the lovely Sharon Osbourne, Rylan and Danny Dyer. Bloody starstruck. All this for little old me! And we were invited to go back to London to be on The One Show whilst they aired our little surprise. What a great experience….Patrick Kielty, Alex Scott, James Norton and Emilia Fox - yeah I’m name dropping but they were all so so sweet to us, especially to Ivy. Even all the backstage crew were dreamy. The studio had such a nice little vibe and now I want to be on telly forever please. As part of my little surprise, the BBC had been in touch with some gorgeous women and friends who follow my blog. It absolutely warmed my heart to see beautul messages from people I don’t even know, who follow my story and who have been affected by my column in some shape or form. There’s not a better feeling than knowing there are people out there you’re helping somehow! I couldn’t help but feel a bit silly once we got home last week - I said to my friend Nat that I keep getting treats and I feel like it needs to stop. But she put me back in my place and reminded me of all the people who benefit from the fundraising and the blog and that it’s perfectly okay to be spoilt every now and again - so I’m going with that. For now, we’re getting fully into the swing of Christmas - our house is just a constant Christmas disco but that’s the way we love it. Music has always played a big part in our lives - Michael toured Japan, Europe and The UK as a drummer in the KBC, we loooove recording songs together at home and it has even been proven that music helps psychologically. Sonos recently did a study which showed quality sound increases your emotions, makes you happier and overall makes you a better human Listening motivates us to exercise more, supercharges our sex lives, sparks new ideas, improves our mood and makes us more productive I % believe this. There are even some cancer centres which have singing groups to help with low mood etc. We’re lucky enough to own a few Sonos speakers at home, they’re incredible because they all link up to each other as well as have voice recognition! “TURN IT UP” .

A cold northerly blast will roar in during the middle of next week with wintry showers possible on the big day. It will follow an unsettled weekend with bouts of strong winds and torrential forecast through until Christmas Eve.Heavy rain threatens flooding across swathes of Britain prompting a raft of Met Officeweather warnings and Environment Agency alerts.A severe weather warning for more heavy rain is in place across southern England from .am on Saturday until noon on Sunday. It warns of potential travel delays and flooding as up to mm of rain is forecast in parts during the warning period. It means those heading home for Christmas could face severe delays. Thermometers will plunge overnight into Christmas morning with a widespread frost expected and slim chance of snow. James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, said: We could still see a true White Christmas particularly in northern parts of the country.  A blast of air from the south will push temperatures above-average for winter over the next few days. Low-pressure from the west will give the weather a shake up with heavy rain threatening floods in parts of the country. The weather will start to calm down towards the middle of next week when polar air will make it feel much colder. Met Office meteorologist Emma Smith said: We are going into quite an unsettled period of weather with low pressure in charge although it will feel milder in the run up to Christmas. After the weekend high pressure will build and although it will be more settled it will turn colder with the arrival of Arctic Maritime air. There will be some showers around on Christmas Eve although Christmas Day is looking drier. There will be some easterly winds along the east coast of the country, to the southwest there will be milder winds coming in from the west. Weather Company meteorologist Amy Hodgson added: Our current forecast favours slightly cooler conditions from Christmas Day, with temperatures dropping marginally below normal as a colder flow from the north-east develops across eastern areas.  On Friday, adverse weather led to the part-closure of the M motorway while several rail lines were blocked. Sussex Police described driving conditions in the region as miserable, and said there was a lot of standing water on the roads. Devon and Cornwall Police said flooding across the force area made a number of roads impassable and it urged motorists to take extra care and avoid driving into standing water. Highways England has urged motorists to adapt their driving for wet weather by slowing down, keeping well back from the vehicle in front and easing off the acceleratorsteering becomes unresponsive.

For many, a trip to the bathroom during a flight is escapable and the unusual signs stuck on the lavatory walls probably raise several questions. For starters, why is the flush so loud  And why can’t you flush while seated  It turns out that the ‘whoosh’ noise that is so loud it sounds as though you and your fellow passengers will be catapulted from the plane, is actually an air vacuum. Once a passenger has done their business and presses flush, the pressure of the airplane cabin ‘evacuates’ the toilet bowl. A trapdoor in the base of the toilet opens and a blue solution called Skykem fills the bowl. As the bowl is waterless, the powerful vacuum suction has to be so strong it leaves nothing behind, while Skykem is swirled around to remove odours. From the toilet, the waste is sucked through pipes to the rear of the plane where it is dumped into a tank until the end of the flight.  James Kemper invented the modern airplane toilet to remove problems like spillage - which can turn the myth of falling faeces into a reality. Since pilots can’t clear the tanks during flight, the waste remains in tow until the aircraft has landed where it is removed by trucks.

Bethany, an eight-month-old Labrador cross, was born with such a severe facial disfigurement that her entire snout twists and droops to one side, exposing her teeth. While her lop-sided face may be startling to look at, it doesnapost impact the aposhappy-go-luckyapos poochaposs health in any way. Bethany, who was vet-checked and approved to travel from Romania to UK after her rescue, can eat, drink, run and play just like any other pup. Now her rescuers at the charity Safe Rescue For Dogs, who are based in Norwich, Norfolk, where Bethany is being fostered, desperately want to find this special girl a permanent home. Volunteer fosterer Zoe Casey, , hopes that whoever adopts Bethany will be able to look past the dogaposs deformity and instead see her aposamazingapos personality. Zoe said: Thereaposs absolutely nothing wrong with Bethany - she doesnapost even snore when sheaposs asleep. People have asked aposare we sure weaposre doing the right thing apos and aposhow do we know apos. We know because sheaposs been vet checked and checked again at Calais and Dover at DEFRA. If she was ill, she would have been seized because thataposs their job. She is absolutely fine. She is the most amazing dog. She is gentle and happy.  We have been out walking her and sheaposs already fine off the lead. She runs around and comes back when called. She loves kids, sheaposs good with other dogs, she is as near to perfect temperament-wise as you are ever going to get. She is very much [like] a Labrador in her temperament. Sheaposs happy-go-lucky and absolutely lovely. There is an attitude of people looking for the picture-perfect dog but I think people need to look a bit deeper. We hope Bethany finds a normal family who treats her like a normal dog because she is normal evenshe doesnapost look it. We just want a nice, run-of-the-mill family who will look after her and not see what she looks like but what she is, an amazing dog. What she looks like is irrelevant because her heart is pure gold.  Bethanyaposs mum was a street dog in Romania when she fell pregnant but a family took her in and helped care for her litter of five pups until they could be rescued. It is believed by the vet in Romania that the puppies are part Pekingese and the mixture of genes may have contributed to Bethanyaposs wonky face. Safe Rescue For Dogs, which was launched by Zoeaposs sister Kelly Hare, , travel to Romania at least once a year to help combat the countryaposs stray dog problem and take in pooches. One of Bethanyaposs siblings has been rehomed already and the charity are still waiting on the arrival of the last two pups into the country.  While this is the first time anyone at the charity has seen a dog with a wonky face, Zoe says a facial disfigurement is much easier to accept than the emotional turmoil some rescue dogs have endured. Zoe said: People do see Bethany and theyaposre a bit shocked by her face but when you have worked in the industry, you arenapost shocked, you just accept it. Sometimes a facial disfigurement is not as bad as a mental disfigurement when does have been treated badly.

It brings people in and there would be a great atmosphere. It would have proper digital TVs showing other games and all the score updates and it is an environment you would want to be in as a fan.“There is room for more of a family-based concept for kids to run around and there’s comfort food.

Now we’ve got Funso back and he has a wealth of experience there so that’s good.”Celtic were in midweek action against Hearts at Tynecastle with Neil Lennon’s men recording a comfortable - win in Edinburgh.Gallagher watched the game on television with some of his team-mates.He’s well aware of the Hoops’ threats but has backed Aberdeen to compete with them as the Dons look to finish  on a high.After today the Reds tackle Livingston at Pittodrie and Hearts on December  before the Premiership’s January break.Gallagher said: “We know the threats Celtic possess. A couple of us watched them on Wednesday night.“We’ll be trying to compete with them. Obviously last time out it didn’t go so well.“But we feel we’ve moved on as a side since then and we’ve got a few boys back from injury as well.“That helps and hopefully we should be able to put out a strong side to compete with them.“December is usually a tough month for every club because there are quite a lot of games so it’s a test of the squad.“We think we’ve got a strong squad and we want to demonstrate that in the remaining games before the break.”"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor november 1 2019","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,It is time for Remembrance again and many people will be wearing a red poppy in support of the allied servicemen and women who suffered during the last century.White poppies have been on sale since  to support and remember all victims of all wars, be they civilian or military and regardless of race or gender.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each.

Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line.

No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

This year’s winner, picked by the skipper, was Robert ‘Grinch’ MacBrayne.The day started off as expected, pretty cold with a few light showers. Fishing was slow at first with roughly an hour passing before the first catch came aboard, but after that it was non-stop until lunchtime.The quality of spurs and whiting was better than expected with very few undersized caught. Most made the measure and on average spurs hit the -cm mark with a couple of decent ones coming in at cm tipping the scales at lbs oz.As the day progressed the weather deteriorated with heavy showers, hail and really strong gusts spinning the boat leading to the inevitable Etive tangles.A decision was made to cut the day short and lines up was called at pm.Given the conditions everyone coped well and at the end of the day four species, spurs, whiting, lsd and pouting, added to the tally of  counting fish.Highlight of the day were the two sea eagles that flew in quite close on the hunt for food but they had their work cut out with so many greedy gulls around. Food wasn’t an issue for the boys though with homemade soup, tablet, shortbread and ginger wine all hitting the spot.Back ashore and the scores tallied up, the winner of this year’s Christmas Shield was Gordon Law with Robert MacBrayne in second place.

the Napoleonic wars and entrepreneurial James Cameron to the bullish Thomas Noble and heroic Duncan McPherson - until its sale into private ownership in the s.The purchase by William Borthwick and

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year.

Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

It came after representatives of the local industries which discharge their waste effluents into the main sewage system indicated that they would be willing to co-operate in the neutralising of the acids in their effluents.Without neutralising the acid would prove damaging to the pumps envisaged for the new scheme.The motion calling on the council to give the go-ahead on the project was made by Dean of Guild William Stevenson, and seconded by Councillor N. S. McCallum, who said: #I think health comes before money in this respect.#Fears were expressed about the effect the scheme would have on the rates. Councillor Alastair McKinlay said: #It might be that in years to come we, as a council, will be blamed for putting the rates up.#Provost Daniel McKinven said that the efforts made in the past to secure the new sewage system for Campbeltown were #joint efforts#. The Provost said that the council had #done this for the good of Campbeltown# and that they would #see to it# that local labour is employed on the actual scheme.Mr W. P. Scott, the representative at the meeting of Messrs. Crouch and Hogg, the firm of consulting engineers who will be employed on the project, said that the pumping main would probably be laid along under the Low Askomel road.Mr Scott commented that the most expensive part of the scheme will be the actual laying of the pipelines.Hon. Treasurer George Halbert and Town Chamberlain, Mr William B. Allen, calculated that the rates may have to be increased by s d to cover the cost of the scheme. But Mr Halbert pointed out that the increase may be considerably more.The final calculation will not be made until Messrs. Crouch and Hogg supply a final figure for the cost of the scheme.The town will be eligible for a rates support grant.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGOHighland Parish Church ChoirOn Wednesday night the choir of the Highland Parish Church gave a concert in the Kirk Street Hall in aid of the funds of the Women#s Guild.The audience quite filled the hall, and a most enjoyable programme was received with every indication of appreciation.The choir contributed two-part songs which were rendered tunefully and with fine feeling, and the audience responded with particular warmth.The vocal solos by members of the choir were all most successfully rendered.The songs were nicely selected and several singers, heard for the first time, performed with great taste and sweetness.The soloists were Misses Macalpine, L.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet. Well maybe you have, but you just havenrsquot spoken to them or really seen them for who they are."},{"url":null,"title":"hometown-clubs-special-honour-golf-star-catriona-matthew","story":"They gave Catriona, who is from the town, the membership in celebration of her victorious Solheim Cup captaincy at this yearrsquos competition, which was held at Gleneagles in September.Stuart Martin, golf operations manager at North Berwick Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was absolutely delighted when she was given the [Solheim Cup] captaincy.ldquoEveryone was delighted for her when she won the Solheim Cup, especially since she has been related to North Berwick Golf Club for so many years.ldquoGiving her the honorary le membership was a no-brainer ndash everyone was delighted for it to go through.Catriona has been a member of North Berwick Golf Club since , when she was just  years old.On Catrionarsquos reaction to being given the honorary le membership, Stuart added: ldquoShe was just delighted and thanked everyone for being there.ldquoShe talked a little bit about her history growing up playing on the West Links, which led to her going on to do bigger and better things on the European Tour and her experience at the Solheim Cup.The club also announced it was renaming its East Lounge, located on the top floor of the clubhouse, the Catriona Matthew Lounge.Mr Martin added: ldquoShe was a little bit shocked to hear we were renaming the lounge after her.ldquoShersquos quite a private person and keeps herself to herself but she was delighted to receive both of these recognitions."},{"url":null,"title":"consultation-proposed-transport-hub-haddington-branded-shambolic","story":"Protests are expected to take place outside Haddington Town House on Monday evening when the proposals are put to the public.And angry business owners are also planning to place banners outside the townrsquos General Election polling station at the Aubigny Centre today .In recent weeks, East Lothian Council has repeatedly changed plans for a public consultation on a controversial proposal for a new car park east of the town centre. One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended due to securing availability of key members of the project team being available to answer public questions.ldquoInvitations to the stakeholdersrsquo meeting are for two representatives from a range of

It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets. This site provides an opportunity to add some additional supply into the town to encourage parking behaviour that is more appropriate.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who represents the Dunbar and East Linton ward, was unable to comment on the specics of the proposals as he is convener of the councilrsquos planning committee. But he said but said there was a need to address parking problems in the town.He said: ldquoThe old part of the town, the narrow streets around Church Street and Castle Street, is very congested with the number of cars parked there because of the restrictions on the High Street.

A fundamental sht has taken place, not only in Englandrsquos mindset, but the manner in which its voters were induced to back Mr Johnson.What  have we learned from this extraordinary election  Well, herersquos my initial take. I look forward to hearing yours.. The ruthless, despicable tactics used by Dominic Cummings and Vote Leave to win the EU referendum campaign were not an aberration. As Mr Johnsonrsquos victory highlights, they are the new norm. Wersquore going to have to get used to digital s and elements of the media spreading misinformation like wildfire, possible foreign interventions, bamboozling distraction techniques, blatant dishonesty during broadcast interviews. How the Conservativesrsquo opponents respond will be crucial. Play it clean and be crushed, or get dirty, too, and join in them in the moral sell-out  You decide.. Simple slogans ndash especially those created by the aforementioned Cummings ndash really do work. By the end of the campaign just about every voter vox-popped in England seemed to be parroting the ldquowe just need to get Brexit done line. This undoubtedly helped consolidate the pro-Brexit vote around the Tories.. Labourrsquos claim to be the party of working people no longer stands up. Jeremy Corbyn and his disciples can blame media bias for his partyrsquos disastrous result till the cows come home but it wonrsquot change the fact that their man and his policies were a monumental turn-off across the partyrsquos traditional heartlands. Labourrsquos disastrous stance on Brexit didnrsquot help, but the rejection goes deeper. The fact that people living in poverty believed Boris Johnson would look after their interests better than a lelong socialist is both grim and fascinating. Sadly for the poor, we canrsquot bet on Labour facing up to these harsh truths any time soon.. Speaking of Labour claims that donrsquot stand up, we can surely all now agree that a Labour government is not going to ldquosave Scotland, either from the Tories or independence. This ridiculous and out-dated argument was still being peddled on doorsteps, not only by London-based Labour but many in the Scottish party, too. It really would be in the partyrsquos interests to accept that comparing independence ndash which for the vast majority of supporters is based on a simple desire for self-determination ndash to Farage-style nationalism is not only highly insulting, but as wersquove seen for years, electoral suicide. There have been signs over the weekend that at least some in Scottish Labour are waking up. Too little, too late  Quite possibly.. The evisceration of the Lib Dems tells us that Jo Swinson ran a flawed campaign based on a fatal overestimation of her own popularity. It also suggests England doesnrsquot like three-party politics.Or hung parliaments. You can kiss goodbye to any thoughts of electoral reform.. The SNP-Tory stand-off over Indyref cannot go on forever. Both sides are already upping the ante, with Mr Johnson and Michael Gove categorically ruling out another referendum, and Nicola Sturgeon intensying the narrative with talk of Scotland being ldquoheld prisoner. Such shadow boxing plays well to both partiesrsquo core support, of course, but eventually one side will have to go for the knockout blow. Itrsquos hard to see what more Ms Sturgeon can do in the face of such denials and hypocrisyfrom a tin-eared PM buoyed by a right-wing majority, at least until the Holyrood elections of . However Mr Johnson, who purports to be a classical scholar, would do well to learn lessons from more recent events, not least the unstoppable push for devolution that resulted from Mrs Thatcherrsquos condescending and contemptuous attitude towards Scotland during her - year stint as PM. The unpredictable nature of the Johnson-Cummings premiership means you never know what will happen, of course. Will they fancy calling the SNPrsquos bluff  Time will tell.. Meantime, the SNP needs to fashion fresh and persuasive arguments for independence in the post-Brexit world, with palatable solutions to the dficult questions and scenarios created by the UK leaving the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"diary-large-hare-krishna-centre-glasgow-possibly-go-wrong","story":"IrsquoM guessing it happens sort of like thishelliptwo guys are drinking in a local boozer, gulping down pint after pint. Perhaps a few whisky chasers come into play in a cunning attempt to dilute all that Tennentrsquos Lager swishing about in their stomachs.But all good things must come to an end, even Saturday night benders. Accepting this grudgingly, the tanked-up twosome sashay and sway from the comfort of the bar, out into the night, where the winter wind slaps them hard across their faces, like a temperance campaigner confronting a pair of naughty bootleggers in prohibition Chicago.Our booze hounds are feeling the pain, alright. But, lo, whatrsquos this they spy  An open door. And a shimmering light emanates from that door. Crossing the threshold theyrsquore confronted by celestial music wafting down a steep staircase. The music draws the men forward. Upward. Climbing the staircase, they enter a room of chanting, dancing, frolicking and blissed-out fervour.Have they perhaps died of alcoholic poisoning on this dreich and rain-dappled Glasgow evening  Slipped the mortal coil and entered the heavenly realm Nope. The drunken duo have accidentally stumbled into OM Sweet OM, a Hare Krishna Centre in Glasgows Oswald Street, where a gathering of the faithful are in full chant mode. Irsquom one of the gang, as it happens, chanting along with about  other people. This being my first time, Irsquove not quite reached the state of transcendental ecstasy everyone  seems to have tuned into with ease.Which is probably why I immediately spot the drunks staggering into the room. And I must admit theyrsquore making me feel more than a wee bit uncomfortable. Whatthe booze bruvs start getting brash, boisterous, bolshiehellip or worse OK, wersquove got them outnumbered,  to two. Butit comes down to a fight, theyrsquove got inebriation on their side. All wersquove got is spiritual enlightenment. And, quite frankly, in a scrap booze beats beatic bliss. Every time.No Morris Dancers hereLuckily the night doesnrsquot turn violent. The drunks wobble amongst us for a while, their eyes wide like small children watching a particularly trippy episode of In The Night Garden. At one point they stagger over to one of the mantra chanters, who happens to be blind, and start to pet her guide dog.But thatrsquos as tactile as they get. Mostly they just stare. And therersquos plenty to stare at. Before arriving at OM Sweet OM, Irsquod assumed Hare Krishna chanting would be laidback and passive. Itrsquos not. For a start, therersquos musical accompaniment. And I donrsquot mean the wispy twang of a solitary sitar. Blokes are playing lead and bass electric guitars while drums provide a hypnotic dance beat.And, yes, plenty of people are getting into the groove. They arenrsquot performing some sort of heavily stylised dance ritual. No Morris dancers here. What Irsquom witnessing is essentially a bunch of rave-heads letting rip. The dancers gain energy and exuberance by grinning manically at each other. Coke-heads behave in a similar manner, though no illicit substances have passed anyonersquos lips this night.At times the dancing morphs into an Eastern version of a ceilidh. The movers and groovers weave in and out of each otherrsquos giddy embrace. All the while the chant continues: ldquoHare Krishnahellip Hare KrishnahellipAt the beginning of the evening I was told the chanting helps focus the mind on the immediacy of the moment. The person meditating is freed from the anguish of the past and concerns over the future. Although Irsquom enjoying the party atmosphere, Irsquom struggling to attain that desired state of being. I remain doggedly attached to my multitude of petty concerns. Even when the drunks leave, as eventually they do, I still find my mind chained to me. Therersquos just no escaping myself.Though to be honest, even without the distraction and enticement of a greasy lump of meat speared on a prong, Irsquod still be hard-pressed to keep my mind focused on spiritual matters. Therersquos no getting away from it, Irsquom a gutter-grubbing sorta guy.Otherwise there would be chaosUnlike Ramunas Bucimskas who is a bona fide Hare Krishna monk who also answers to the spiritual name Raghumath. Once the chant and stomprsquos over for the evening, I grab the opportunity to chat to Ramunas, whorsquos originally from Lithuania, though he left to study IT in Scotland. Irsquom curious to knowthere have been any prior drunken invasions into the Hare Krishnarsquos devotional space. Theyrsquore located in a rowdy part of town, after all, surrounded by pubs, clubs and fast food joints. ldquoOccasionally it happens, says Ramunas with a shrug and a relaxed smile. ldquoWe want to keep a safe environment, so we make sure thatpeople accidentally wander in here, they never cross a certain line. If theyrsquore in a friendly mood, wersquore friendly too. If theyrsquore a little more aggressive, then we have to be a little bit firm and ask them to leave.He adds: ldquoOf course wersquore a peaceable group, but we recognise that a certain level of violence is necessary in society. Thatrsquos why we have a police department, which we support. Otherwise there would be chaos.In other words,things had got really out of hand Ramunas would have called the cops rather than attempting to fend off the intruders by thrusting a locally-sourced radish in their faces. Irsquom glad to hear it.Beatic, Beatlish blissRamunas proceeds to tell me about the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, the organisation behind the OM Sweet OM centre. Itrsquos the same group that George Harrison, that most contemplative of Beatles, supported and promoted throughout much of his le. They teach a brand of Hinduism focusing on yoga, meditation, mindfulness, mantra, music and a plant-based diet.In the early s, counterculture figures such as the beat poet Allen Ginsberg were attracted to their belief system. By that decadersquos end it wouldnrsquot have been entirely far-fetched to label Krishna Consciousness the official religion of the hippies. The musical Hair even had the cast belting out the Hare Krishna mantra.But Irsquom no hippy, and as I admit to Ramunas, I struggled to tap into the spiritual angle of the evening. Does this mean I wasted my time meditating ldquoNot at all, he says. ldquoOf course we offer spiritual guidance. But there are many people who donrsquot have any spiritual beliefs whatsoever. But they practice mediation with us anyway. It helps them on a physical level and makes them feel much healthier.So did I leave feeling healthier  Indeed I did. For all of two minutes. The precise amount of time it took me to stride down the stairs of OM Sweet OM, turn left on Oswald Street, and bound into the kebab shop that had been enticing me all evening. Ten minutes after that, I wasnrsquot feeling healthy at all.I guess itrsquos safe to say that I havenrsquot reached the George Harrison plane of beatic, Beatlish bliss quite yet."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-put-women-charge","story":"Wall to wall white, middle aged men in suits, the only nod towards ersity being the one fellow whos gone rogue and not put a tie on.This open-necked rascal is one of  chaps in a photograph tweeted by Jake Berry, Cabinet Minister for the Northern Powerhouse to welcome the new #BlueWall of northern Conservative MPs to parliament.\"Working together,\" he captioned this sea of raw masculinity without any consideration of the subtext, \"Wersquoll hunt like a pack to get a brilliant deal for people across the #NorthernPowerhouse.\"If these lads are the hunters, who are their prey  The unemployed  The disabled  Single mums with more than two children  Interns  Cant wait to find out.And yet a record  female MPs have taken their seats in Westminster this week.

Only a third of SNP MPs are women.Back to Labour and the leadership race is underway, awash with female candidates. Eight MPs, six of them women and two of them Keir Starmer and David Lammy, have been touted as candidates for the race.Now, though, there are suggestions that one of those expected to throw her hat in the ring will now run for deputy leader in order to smooth the path for a friend. In a move described as \"sisterly\", Angela Raynor is expected to step back to give Rebecca Long-Bailey a leg up.Should a woman be given the task of steering the Good Ship Labour it will be the first time in the partys  year history, bar one brief interim.As a rival pack to Team BlueWall, the women whose names are being suggested are formidable candidates.Jess Phillips is charismatic and persuasive Lisa Nandy seems to have a grip on the distinction between London and the north of England, otherwise lacking in Labour Long-Bailey is a union favourite Stella Creasy is dynamic Emily Thornberry impressed when standing in for Jeremy Corbyn at Prime Ministers Questions.Should a male party leader be chosen in the face of all this female talent, robust explanations will be required. Its about time the partys glass ceiling was smashed. Its  years since the Labour Party brought a landslide  female MPs to the House of Commons, doubling the number of women MPs overnight. Let us gloss over the sexist Blairs Babes moniker and move on to the fact the women have been allowed to only go so far.In the words of Barack Obama, speaking this week at a private event on leadership, women arent perfect but,Labour really plans to have a serious spell of introspection, it could start by doing something fresh and new.After saying that women arent perfect, Obama added: \"What I can say pretty indisputably is that youre better than us [men].\"\"Im absolutely confident,\" he said, \"That for two yearsevery nation on earth was run by women, you would see a signicant improvement across the board on just about everything... living standards and outcomes.\"The argument begins to pale a little when you take a glance at two recent examples. Theresa May and Jo Swinson were savaged, neither doing an successful job of leading their respective parties.Theres an unfortunate cliche of women being expected to pick up after men and this extends to politics. It was expected that Theresa May would come in and repair the damage done by David Cameron after he ided the country and scarpered to his pound, designer shed to write about the experience.While Vince Cable did a stand up job of heading the Liberal Democrats, there was still a strong narrative that Jo Swinson, a woman who cant define what a woman is, would be a breath of change, leading the party in a new and fresh direction, a direction towards electoral victory.The problem women leaders face is that, when they are impressive - German Chancellor Angela Merkel, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern - their femaleness is praised as a reason why.Yet when, say, Argentinarsquos Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner defaults on international loan payments, or Australiarsquos Julia Gillard is strong armed out by her own party, the fact they are a woman is held against them.Women are expected to resolve years of inequality almost overnight or be cast as failures.Fact of the matter is, we dont have enough and consistent examples to say that female rulers would outperform men, or even do things dferently from their male counterparts.But studies show that women approach negotiation and politics in a dferent way to men. Earlier this year I was in Sierra Leone visiting a project where, to address poverty, financial structures were placed solely in the hands of women because they were shown to use the money for healthcare, housing, education and entrepreneurship.They focused on the means of lting the whole village, prioritising the treatment of everyone.You would hope that putting a woman in charge of the Labour party would lead to the same priority. The one thing we do know, is that the Prime Minister is not good with women.A female leader of the opposition might be just the thing to unnerve - and eventually unseat - him."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-airport-owners-rumoured-behind-prestwick-takeover-bid","story":"Transport secretary Michael Matheson announced a buyer had been found for the troubled transport hub, which passed into public ownership for pound in .:Preferred bidder chosen to take over Prestwick AirportMr Matheson said the bidder for the airport, operated on a commercial basis and at armsfrom the Scottish Government, could not be disclosed.However, reports in The Scotsman suggest AGS Airports, which also owns hubs in Aberdeen and Southampton, are the group behind the purchase.It is currently unknown whether pound million worth of loans owed to the Scottish Government will be repaid as part of the deal.Earlier this month, the airportreported a total loss of pound. million, including loan interest, for the  months ended March .:State-backed Prestwick Airport posts a fresh lossA spokesperson for the group said: ldquoWe have always stated we would welcome an outcome which s Prestwick Airport to a commercial footing in the private sector.He added: \"We have been monitoring the situation closely following the Governmentrsquos decision to place the airport on the market and will continue to watch with interest."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-born-lose","story":"WATCHING Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson march side-by-side into Parliament this week ndash one grim, one grinning ndash was a stark reminder that the lottery of le is all about winners and losers.

But even during the day when they have time off they go to dance classes and fitness classes because they need to keep their body in shape. But they adore it.The hour-long programme goes behind the scenes to meet the formidable characters who run the Moulin Rogue, which was famously the inspiration for the hit  musical film starring Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman.It also captures the incredible spectacle of the dancers performing the can-can outside the legendary venue in October this year -  years to the day since it opened in  on the citys Montmatre in the th arrondissement.Michaela Rondelli, , from Almondbank in Perthshire, was auditioned privately for her role in the revue show and feels the nudity is on the womenrsquos terms.The champion Highland dancer said: ldquoItrsquos not vulgar in any way. Itrsquos actually really empowering to be on stage as a woman and to have the choice to do that. Itrsquos great to have the confidence to do that. I know some people wouldnrsquot, but wersquore all strong confident women at work and we all really enjoy it.ldquoBut any time someone goes home they ask what we want brought back from Scotland.

We might live and work in Paris, but wersquoll always be Scots girls at heart.Sarah Tandy, , from Whitburn has been dancing at the Moulin for  years and is married to fellow Moulin Rouge dancer, Australian David Tandy, with whom she has an infant son Elliott.The principal dancer said: ldquoJoining the Moulin has given me everything ndash a well-paid job, a husband and a family. I started my career at Moulin and thatrsquos where I hope to retire.Returning to the stage after having a child was a challenge for a new mother.ldquoIt was a shock to the system, she added. ldquoIrsquod been off for a full year and went back to work when he was six months old. I had a fear of putting on those costumes again, getting out in front of thousands of people, not being sure that Irsquod be able to do it like I had done before.The programme, presented by Cathy Macdonald, also features trained ballet dancer Lucy Monaghan, from Glasgow a former pupil of the prestigious Dance School of Scotland atKnightswood Academy in Glasgow and Londonrsquos Central School of Ballet.The  year old said: ldquoI started dancing when I was five years old and loved it. I decided when I was ten that I wanted to do this as a career. You canrsquot beat having the opportunity to perform every single night. The theatre holds  people and therersquos never a spare seat.

Indeed, Ministers have stopped even referring to the deadline,” Mr McArthur said.“It is all the more important, therefore, that priority is given to connecting those communities who have been waiting longest for any sort of service. Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unfortunately the indications from the EU-Norway talks are that this did not happen and our fishing communities are going to feel the consequences.“Sustainability is important but we must remember that no one has more incentive to ensure sustainable fisheries than family-owned businesses and fishing communities. These groups depend on having reliable stocks now and for future generations.”He continued: “Amongst all the technical discussions and ideological debates, the direct impact on local communities who are reliant on fishing and the surrounding industries is being forgotten. Sustainable fisheries should protect the long-term success of our distinct fishing communities. I hope that the key players in these talks, and our Government, can set aside ideology and reflect on the social impact of quota changes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Would make a change wouldn’t it ”Yet again we have a Tory Government which lost the election in Scotland, with just six out of  seats and the SNP with , Labour with one and the Lib Dems with four. Yet we will have for the next five yearsTory rule. Where is the democracy in that : Queen’s Speech rules out new Scottish independence referendum: Why SNP are bluffing when they say they want indyref – John McLellanAh but, I hear you say, this was a UK election, live with it. Yet we were told after the  referendum that Scotland was in a partnership of equals. It’s a gey funny partnership, especially as one of the partner nations vows to veto the will of another, which is exactly what Boris de Pfeffel Johnson is doing.This result is not a one-off. This election continued the narrative of two nations: England and Scotland, one turning Tory blue and the other SNP yellow. So now we have had three results where Scotland has voted and made a firm claim to travelling in a dferent direction. Good Friday AgreementFirst came the EU referendum, when  per cent voted Remain and  per cent Leave . Then came the EU election with six seats up for grabs the SNP taking three, the Tories one, the Lib Dems one and the Brexit Party one. Now we’ve had the stunning recent victory for the SNP. We also have  MSPs in the Scottish Parliament to the Tories’ .Yet against all this, Johnson refuses a Section  order to allow the ­Scottish Parliament to conduct a ­referendum on the future of Scotland as to whether or not we should be independent. So the leader of a party with just six seats in Scotland can stymie the will of the Scottish ­Parliament – which has agreed in principle to a referendum.He talks of bringing the nation together. Which nation  The UK is not a nation. England is a nation, Scotland is a nation, Wales a principality and Northern Ireland part of the UK. But check out the Good Friday Agreement which states that “the Secretary of State” should call a referendum “ at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland”.Factor in now that there are more United Ireland MPs than Unionists and indeed that Northern Ireland voted Remain and Boris Johnson doesn’t just need to look northand pay attention and respect to Scotland, but cast his eyes west to Northern Ireland.Indeed when you look at that statement in the Good Friday Agreement, you wonder how the same test should not apply now to Scotland.I cannot see how, Canute-like, the Tories can sustain vetoing Scotland having a choice on its own future. Indeedhe is so sure of the Union, why not put it to the test  He thinks he is on a roll, so Boris, go for it.Christine Grahame is the SNP MSP for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates. Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Jo was talking about the past.Willie was thinking about the future.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg. Like what Robert did there though, referring to Jacob#s sister, formerly of the Brexit Party, and no longer campaigning for them in the South East of England. You#ve got to ask how a spare bedroom tax would impact on that family# including in their second and third homes and any additional properties in their portfolios.WHY SOCIALIST SNP MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE LABOUR TOMORROW:For the first time in forty years and possibly for the last time during my le, we have the chance to support a manesto that includes widespread nationalisation and the restoration of worker’s rights.These are policies that any self-respecting socialist would have regarded as red lines before Thatcher came along and “modernised” British politics.After Brexit and Scottish independence, we willto the natural battle between left and right. It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.When Boris replies to the letter requesting an independence referendum for Shetland, I hope the recipient will share it on this forum.We could all do with a laugh.Don#t make us laugh IanI wouldn#t trust this council to run a bath never mind having full autonomy of all the finances!Are you going to be King Ian Just a jest, George, but many a true word!If Sturgeon goes Indy I would rather stay with the UK or go for autonomy. . Think about it.Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited. Some wonderful handwringing from Carmichael on Viking Energy this election.Well done for your stand there and on UHA.Particularly pleasing to see Friends of the Earth saying Labour#s manesto was better for the environment than that of the Greens.O dear, poor Peter.On the wrong side again.#Labour#s worst performance since #. #Corbin’s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members.# What the Socialist left did for Labour, just imagine what the would do to the UK and shudder!!! Momentumare the new Militant Tendency, no wonder they are heading to the dust bin of history.No, I am agreeing with you Malcolm, and also saying there is a conversation to be had locally about how long Shetland should continue to host the oil industry.The biggest benefit would have been in stable local employment, but that is not what we have seen.If the oil industry honours its original promises there will be years of work in ing the terminal site to nature.Some will say the sooner that begins the better.If that thinking can#t happen on the left where  will it happen Apparently % voted for political parties that wanted a second Brexit referendum, but now we#ve got the blues.What hope now for the  in  bairns born into poverty Thank goodness we avoided Corbyn#s, Socialism Peter. Look to Socialism in Venasuallia what that would do for us. That whole country is in poverty.Over  million scots voted to remain in the uk nowhere near that amount of scots voted to remain in the eu or for the snp. What is it about democracy you don#t understand  You seem to think you just change the question to suit the answer you claim to have got to a question that was never asked. And then have the gall to say that brexiteers didn#t know what they were voting for.Think about this George. If two years ago I had said Boris would be PM with a landslide every one would have laughed. The phrase is #He who has the last laugh#, Ho, Ho, Ho. Now everyone calm down.

In response to Ofgem’s decision, SSEN is also promising to progress preparation of the Shetland #standby arrangements# which will complement the transmission link.It is hoped the decision will provide Shetland’s renewable developers clarity about future network charges, helping them make investment decisions and provide the evidence required by Ofgem for the regulator to approve the proposed transmission link to the Shetland Isles. Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.“The proposal will support future security of supply as well as unlocking Shetland’s renewable potential.Once built, the transmission link and the low carbon output from renewable generators on Shetland will also help support the electricity needs of Shetland’s oil and gas industry and its wider economy.“Our transmission business will shortly re-submit to Ofgem an updated Needs Case for the Shetland link and we look forward to working with Ofgem and Shetland developers to progress this proposal in a timely manner.”Funny how things like this are announced during the few days between the General Election and Christmas.Last we heard was renewable energy developers crying their eyes out that the proposed MW cable was inadequate for all the wind farms they want to build on Shetland.#Follow the money#. So-called #contributions# from SSEN#s customers and bigger cables with more generation lead to a reduction in the price of VE#s next bid in a renewable energy auction.Who would bet against SSEN#s revised #final needs case# proposing an even bigger capacity cable, enabling even more and bigger wind farms to be built Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.Does this statement mean that the average shetland family would be able to obtain electricity cheaper on the commissioning of the project  Would it be possiblethe turbines were commissioned prior to the connector cable being commissioned then could the power be made available locally at reduced pricing  This looks like so much greenwash and so many weasel words to a community whose council has a vested interest in rolling over and playing dead. What exactly are we to read into #meeting Shetland#s energy needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers# There is an implied promise there, and even a threat, but no actual guarantee of cheaper bills for local residents.As for #unlocking Shetland#s renewable potential#, this looks like code for unlocking their potential to exploit the landscape and the people through environmentally harmful proposals the people will get no say in.Shetland remains in thrall to the notion that all potential economic activity is necessarily a positive development.Some developments however represent an approach to development that dlsempowers, robs folk of a say and foists solutions onto them that do not address their problems or needs.There will be opportunities for some to profit no doubt, but is is hard for the council to dispassionately manage partnership with these far larger players when they are so wowed by the prospect of cash flowing into the reserves through ground rent to the Busta estate.The SIC will do diddlysquat to ensure local concerns are considered..."},{"url":null,"title":"development officer at shetland tourism association 2 ","story":"A unique opportunity to work with and support tourism businesses throughout Shetland.The STA is seeking a motivated inidual with a passion for tourism for a fixed term  year post.The postholder will work  hours per week on a self-employed basis.Tasks will include website updates, liaising with members and industry bodies, arranging member events, overseeing the implementation of the Tourism Strategy and producing reports as required."},{"url":null,"title":"hjaltland housing association ","story":"HAS AVAILABLE TO REGISTERED APPLICANTSpayable £. p.c.m.

The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can. I will work with our young people to ensure that they are included in decision-making that they have a brighter future and better quality of le.”The Lagmore father-of-three said he will be straight into Mayor business when he takes over the ‘chain’ today.“I want to do this for my family.  has been a dficult year for our family with the loss of our mother Edna. Mum was probably my biggest supporter and I want to do her, my we and children proud. I want to show my kids that there is nothing you can’t achieve through hard work and doing your best.”Sinn Féin group leader on the Council, Ciarán Beattie, described Mr Baker as a “well-respected and grounded community activist in the Colin area”.He added: “He has also been a vocal campaigner for LGBT and Irish language rights, climate action, community empowerment and for mental health awareness. “Danny will take this grassroot style of representation into the role of Mayor and ensure that all the needs of the citizens of this city are reflected in Belfast City Council. I want to pay tribute to outgoing Ard Mhéara John Finucane. He placed human rights social justice, environmentalism and defending Belfast against Brexit at the heart of his term.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"health workers begin 12 hour","story":"THOUSANDS of health workers across the north have begun -hour strike action in a dispute over pay and patient safety.The Royal College of Nursing, who represent around , nurses, are taking strike action for the first time in its -year history.About , other nurses, who are members of Unison have also walked out.On Tuesday night, leaders of the five main parties met the head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, and Health Department Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly, in a th-hour bid to avert the strike action and state their “collective support for the restoration of pay parity”.The Northern Ireland Office later said that Health was a devolved matter and Mr Sterling rejected the idea of restoring pay parity on the grounds of public interest.UNISON Regional Secretary Patricia McKeown said: “Everyone with power and authority in this society has conceded that our cause is just. We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"boxing promoter bob arum apologises for ira comments as frampton and conlan say no malice intended","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

These were respite days for families of young people and adults who have a learning disability. \"It was a fun-filled time with craft activities, food and games, all set in the middle of a church family who are practically showing love and care. \"The true joy of Christmas is about giving of ourselves and enabling others to embrace what is good and at the heart of this time of the year, even when they may find it hard.\"The Methodist President, the Rev Sam McGuffin, referred to the \"scientically proven\" causes of stress at Christmas: the absence of a beloved one, family misunderstandings, economic dficulties, tiredness, loneliness and \"seasonal emotional disturbance\".Rev McGuffin referred to \"a stressful year\", noting the failure to get Brexit done, the absence of the Stormont Executive and mounting political, social, civil and economic problems.He added: \"I believewe were to view Christmas as Gods Greatest Adventure, then we would begin to get some real spiritual sparkle back into Christmas and have a less stressful celebration of this wonderful season. \"I pray for you, and for us all, the most wonderful Christmas and a blessed New Year.\"In a joint statement the Church of Ireland Bishop of Clogher Dr John McDowell and the Catholic Bishop Dr Larry Duffy referred to \"the many signs of darkness\" in todays world.However, they stressed that Christians have good news to tell \"and we are called to proclaim it together by our actions\".\"A very good example of this is to be found in the joint initiative of the Churches in Ireland on the question of housing insecurity and homelessness. \"Last September a series of practical resources around this question, for use in our Church communities, was launched by the Irish Inter-Church Meeting.\"May each of us this Christmas be a light to the world, most especially through our outreach to those in need, and those who are marginalized by economic and political circumstances.\"Dr Noel Treanor, the Catholic Bishop of Down and Connor, referred to the current times of profound change \"which can generate fear, anxiety, insecurity and despair\". He spoke of signs of \"a growing polarisation in society, politics and even in the Church\" which spawns intolerance, insecurity and indference.Dr Treanor added: \"In contrast the luminous guidance of faith provides a source of constancy within the darkness of hopelessness. \"Across the world, the Christian message of hope continues to resource hope, even in places where historically there were no supportive structures for the practice of faith in society. \"Christmas invites us to bear prophetic witness to the ever-new vision of le revealed in the living Word of God, incarnate in Jesus Christ.\""},{"url":null,"title":"meet the northern ireland mum who raised 23k to ensure no child was left without a","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Quite simply, we cannot afford to wait any longer to address the problems facing the health service.\"Another winter like this and the health service will be irreparably damaged.\"Further strikes are planned for January  and  ahead of the January  deadline for politicians here to re-establish the Assembly.A breakthrough to bring an end to the health service crisis appeared unlikely on Wednesday night, with the relationship between the Secretary of State, the Department of Health, unions and politicians disintegrating even further.Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith has refused to budge from his position that health is a devolved matter.After roundtable talks with the political parties, he said again he was unable to intervene and approach the Treasury for additional funding.However, unions have rejected this stance. They have also accused Mr Smith of using the crisis as leverage to force the political parties back into talks to re-establish the Assembly.Patricia McKeown from Unison launched a stinging attack on the head of the local Civil Service, David Sterling.He and the permanent secretary of the Department of Health, Richard Pengelly, have insisted that they cannot bring pay into line with the rest of the UK because it would mean overturning a ministerial decision.In an open letter to Mr Sterling, Ms McKeown argued this position was incorrect and hit out at comments he made in a letter sent to the leaders of the political parties on Tuesday.In the correspondence, Mr Sterling said that in order to meet pay parity demands, the Department of Health would need an additional £m every year.He said this money could alternatively be used to pay for additional activity to reduce the number of people on waiting lists each year by ,.\"It is important to note that other Northern Ireland departments are currently dealing with serious budgetary pressure, including pay pressures,\" he wrote.\"Indeed, there are currently industrial disputes in other parts of the public sector.\"The principle of public sector pay parity is clearly cross-cutting, with potential implications well beyond health.\" In response, Ms McKeown hit out at the fact that Mr Sterling has still not responded to a letter Unison sent to him on November , in which the union sought his intervention to resolve the ongoing dispute.Describing Mr Sterlings letter as \"a deeply unhelpful intervention\", she said she was \"shocked by the apparent attempt to mislead party leaders and the overtly political tone of the letter\".She said a letter from the five political parties providing cover to allow civil servants to meet unions pay demands was sufficient political authority for him to act.\"This having now been provided, we seriously question your failure to act,\" she added.She also said Mr Sterling and the Department of Finance have been creating pay policy in the absence of ministers, such as a recent announcement of a review of public sector pay.Ms McKeown also rejected the argument that there was no ministerial decision to break parity and said that it had instead been argued that the move was necessary to enable the Department of Health to break even.She added: \"We have repeatedly stated that the Treasury should provide whatever additional resources are needed to restore the pay gap.\"You have a clear role in making that argument to them.\"Health workers have kept the system running in the face of continued cuts and austerity.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic and travel latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Sinn Feins Michelle Gildernew won the seat with a majority of just  votes over the UUPs Tom Elliott. A candidate who wants to contest an election result has only  days to do so.New MP and leader of the SDLP Colum Eastwood has called for a full review of Northern Ireland’s voting system and Electoral Office processes. Mr Eastwood said he will raise the matter with the Secretary of State Julian Smith.The whistleblower told the BBC that:Valid applications for postal votes were rejected by the Electoral Office due to errorsSome applications to register to vote were only processed  hours before the deadline to submit additional evidence, such as proof of identity or addressPotential voters were given an incorrect date for the deadline to submit additional evidence to support their applicationHelpline operators on one occasion were asked to share one Nokia phone to field calls from all over Northern IrelandSteve Aiken said: \"Confidence in the electoral system is absolutely essential.\"If the serious allegations from the whistle-blower are confirmed, then last weeks’ election was neither fair nor open for potentially thousands of voters across Northern Ireland.\"Allegations of members of the public being deliberately mislead over deadlines would be especially unforgivableproven to be true. \"Even before these latest allegations came to light my Party had serious concerns regarding the recent operation of the EONI and we had planned to pursue this directly with the organisation.\"We were aware of examples of hand delivered applications for votes – for both new registrations and for absent votes – simply never being processed and when we sought explanations we were told the forms were never received. Crucially, we have examples of such forms being delivered in person to Belfast for voters in the Fermanagh  South Tyrone constituency.\"The centralisation of the EONI to Belfast has been a total disaster. Phone lines were jammed, paperwork was going missing and clerical errors were common-place.\"We are currently taking legal advice in relation to what steps we may now take.”The Chief Electoral Officer Virginia McVea released a statement to the BBC. She said: \"The team at EONI work tirelessly for the people of NI and have done for many years. NI receives expert service from an expert team.Chief Electoral Officer for Northern Ireland Virginia McVea.\"We, like every electoral team across the UK have to employ temporary staff at election times to answer the thousands more calls we get.\"Our phone system is adequate but BT lines were down in Belfast one day.\"We followed their advice on what to do and were treated as priority urgent customers but we have no way to control external infrastructure failures. The staff are well trained over a number of days and continually supported.\"\"Very importantly it is our whole team, including me, who answer queries and resolve issues through the election period by phone email and in person.\"We are very well used to dealing with queries as our team is expert. Staff advised the public to get evidence in by  December at the start to be sure they would have it in in time.\"In the last few days of the lead up staff told people  December and every single piece of evidence to midnight on  December was processed.\"I have been able to double-check that. All election timetable dates were on our website and available throughout the election.\"\"We are duty bound by law to keep processing until the deadline and so its true sometimes we have to ask for evidence right up to the last hours, evenwe think a person could not get information in in time, because that is the right of the public and indeed they will go on the register albeittoo late for voting that time\".Mr Eastwood described the claims as \"signicant\".\"The claims made by a whistleblower this morning are signicant and confirm reports we have received from a number of people who tried to vote in the election only to be told they were not on the register.\"The SDLP raised concerns on an inidual basis with the Electoral Office but it’s clear that there must be a full review of the processes which led to this.\"People must have confidence in the democratic process. I understand that there was an immense amount of pressure on the Electoral Office and the closure of regional offices has contributed in a big way to that pressure. But there is no excuse for disenfranchising people.\"The SDLP has consistently made representations to the Electoral Office about comprehensive oversight of registration, postal and proxy voting. A full review is now necessary and I will be raising the matter with the Secretary of State today.\"The whistleblower claimed he lost his job after advising a caller to the helpline to contact a local councillor with a complaint about the registration process.\"I felt like a lot of people were being impacted... a lot of people were very upset. Members of the public were phoning and finding out they wouldnt be able to vote in the election, people that had followed all the given steps and done everything correctly.\"There was a massive backlog of registrations that the electoral office needed to process and they didnt have the manpower to do it.\"The whistleblower said that ten agents answered helplines in the office in a working environment he described as \"chaos\".On one occasion, the helplines failed and they were given one Nokia phone to pass around to field calls from all over Northern Ireland, he alleged.He said a backlog in voter registrations sat for several weeks, leaving voters only days to send evidence to prove address, which is usually only requested after an initial application is filed.There was also internal confusion over when the deadline to register was, he said.\"A Thursday at the start of December, I came in and asked  the deadline was last night. And there was a  minute debate about when the deadline was. We told people that it was the third [of December], in reality it was actually the fourth.\"We were told \"dont tell people its the fourth\". On the letters we sent out it was clearly given as the third. We didnt even know what time [the deadline] was.\"The whistleblower said he was worried about the number of people the alleged issues around voter registrations may have affected.\"I would fear for the amount of people who just thought everything was OK. When it came to December , wait - whats going on here \"\"The only reason I know this is because people rang chasing it up,\" he said. In a further statement, Ms McVea said: \"Deadlines to register to vote are set in law. All applications receive before the deadline were processed in time for every successful applicant to be on the register in time to vote on December  election. \"It is a requirement in law that application forms are checked and we are required by law to seek additional advicewe cannot match the personal data against records. \"All absent vote application forms were processed in accordance with the law.\"Sinn Fein MP Francie Molloy has said the Electoral Office must be held fully to account in the wake of serious allegations about the operation of the office.Mr Molloy said: \"If people can’t get registered then they are denied their most fundamental democratic right. \"There are clearly serious issues around the competency and effectiveness of the Electoral Office in relation to registration, postal and proxy voting applications and other matters during the most recent election campaign.\"There are allegations which go way beyond human error and incompetence. This needs urgently addressed. \"We also warned the Electoral Office that closing local offices would lead to further problems. \"If these serious and deeply worrying allegations are veried, and they certainly reflect the experience of people who contacted Sinn Fein, those responsible for the operation of the Electoral Office at its most senior level must be held fully to account.\"People had until .pm on November  to register to vote in the General Election."},{"url":null,"title":"ireland and uk trade deal has been made more difficult says varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was a mistake and I accept responsibility for that mistake.”Speaking to reporters in Dublin on Friday, he saidshe had won the by-election last month, she would not have lasted long in the Fine Gael Party.Ms Murphy has said she will mull her future over Christmas and may run as an independent candidate.Mr Varadkar said: “Quite frankly I’m glad she didn’t win. What we have seen in her recent interviews is that she unfortunately does harbour these views towards migrants. We heard the comments about the Wexford bridge and London Bridge… that is raising the sceptre that migration may result in terrorist attacks in Ireland and that is just not factual.“It was really inflammatory and I think it feeds into the kind of racist views that are unfortunately harboured by some people in our society.“I think we would have heard more of it from her only it would have been coming from a TD and I don’t think she would have lasted long in Fine Gael for a number of reasons.”“These are clearly views that she holds and they are not acceptable in the party that I lead. They are not in accordance with Fine Gael values. This is a party that embraces migration – migrants strengthen our economy and our public services and enrich our society.”Mr Varadkar said he had initially been impressed by Ms Murphy for her role in the Road Haulage Association and her knowledge of Brexit issues, but her views on migrants were not consistent with Fine Gael values.“She was impressive in terms of how she made something of herself….She was very vocal and very outspoken and I thought she would be a good addition to the party,” he said.“I had never heard her express anti-migrant or racist views and no one  told me that she did. Once she did, it came as a big surprise and I take responsibility for that.“The truth is when you are captain of a team, from time to time, people let you down. If they don’t change their ways, you take them off the team and I have had to take a number of people off the team in the past number of weeks and some people will not be candidates for us in the general election when it comes.”On Friday morning, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe told RTE radio Ms Murphy was deselected as a general election candidate for the party as her views on society were not consistent with the tone and values at the heart of the party."},{"url":null,"title":"cobham family condemns cynical government approval of defence giant takeover","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Nothing happens. I try moving my arms, my legs I try shting my body in the bed. The white sheet that is covering me doesnt move. Nothing moves. I panic and scream, but I hear nothing – only the beeping machines. I havent made a sound.”A Return to Duty followsClodaghDunlop from Magherafelt as she fights to regain control of her body – even learning to breathe again – following a stroke at the age of .After collapsing while working the night sht on April Fools Day,Clodaghsoon found herself unable to move or communicate, while being aware of everything that was going on around her. This fit and active PSNI officer, who ran four miles a day, is suddenly faced with the prospect of never talking, walking or having a normal le again.The early chapters of the book make for terrying reading.Clodaghdescribes how the inability to move or talk can turn simple thingsinto hours of unimaginable torment.Imagine lying in an uncomfortable, painful position, just adjusting an inch would help, but knowing that you will stay in that position for hours and hours on end. Or worse still, when you fear that the unbearable heat in the room is literally a matter of le and death. ForClodagh“every night feels like a Bear Grylls extreme survival challenge.”The long road to recovery begins with a blink.From hereClodaghs world begins to grow again and its from there thatClodaghs story becomes something truly amazing. Its not just that she overcame locked-in syndrome that is remarkable, but the strength and grace she displayed as she overcame it.Finding ourselves inClodaghs position, I think a lot of us would be broken fairly quickly, worn down by the boredom and the pain and frustration. Happy moments for others would be bitter reminders of all we cant have, the normal day-to-day problems of our loved ones lives would seem insignicant to what we are dealing with. Many would turn away from the world, lost in self-pity.ButClodaghseems to have superhuman drive and determination. She became a police officer after six failed attempts. Before her stroke she travelled around Africa in a tentand skyed in Namibia. This locked-in syndrome messed with the wrong woman – she is a lionheart.It says everything aboutClodaghas person that when she cant even raise her hand, she worriesthat her partner isnt eating right at home. When a family argument swells up, she blinks four times – at that stage pretty much the maximum physical movement she is capable of – to lighten the mood.Even when she finally is able to communicate through a spelling board, she puts the feelings of others above what must be her aching need to be heard again after so much silence. In some of her first words with her partner, she makes sure that he apologises for the way he spoke to a nurse. She spells out jokes so that people wont feel uncomfortable when they visit her.Which is not to say that everything is rosy onClodaghs journey to recovery. The dficult parts are here too – the fights and frustrations, the tears and tantrums, setbacks and dark moments – all here without being glossed over. Maybe thats the policewoman shining through in her writing – this is the way it really was. Just the facts. googletag.cmd.push Here too is the truth of dealing with an imperfect NHS. Some staff ignore or patroniseClodagh, or think it makes sense to ask questions like “Whats wrong ” to a person who can only answer with blinks.Others treat her with the utmost care and kindness, nurses who take the time to put themselves in their patients shoes, to sing to them, to go out of their way to find a special item that means the world to a patient.A lot of books like this are about people in recovery – they say they are in it, a passive environment they find themselves in. A Return to Duty is dferent because it is about creating your own recovery. Its a testament to looking a crisis dead in the eye, then putting your head down, gritting your teeth and slowly grinding out a victory.Clodaghs story is one of determined struggle and mental strength when the worst – and this is the worst – has happened. It is a story of continued hope, when hoping seems utterly pointless, even damaging.“I must block my ears to anything negative,” she says, and keeps pushing and pushing and justwill notaccept the situation.Heres hoping that this book is there to provide advice to the NHS on improving stroke services, insight to families struggling to understand what their loved one is going through and comfort to someone dealing with locked-in syndrome, who can be read this book and know they are not alone.A Return to Duty is available to buy now at local bookstores or online atwww.beatinglockedin. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He attended St. Peters from  - and left with one O Level in English. This week he was awarded a PhD for a thesis assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes. In the midst of the Troubles it was a dficult time for young people to focus on their studies.Maurice said: “For me, leaving school with one O Level and thinking I was stupid, to get into such a prestigious course and successfully completing it is a proud moment.”The Derry man is proof that le is about learning as despite leaving school with few qualications he immersed himself in study and has used it to help others through decades of social and community work.After spending some time on the dole, at -years-old Maurice began voluntary work as a youth worker and enrolled in an Addiction Studies course at Ulster University Magee.This coincided with work at Northlands Addiction Treatment Centre. Maurice believes alcohol was, and still is, the single biggest issue facing Derry. “The problem is that people don’t even view it as a drug, but it’s more powerful than most and one of the few drugs that actually damages the body just by taking it.”The heavy binge drinking culture that exists in Ireland is the source of many social ills, he said. “The main reason children are taken into care, neglect, is often down to parents having a drink problem.” googletag.cmd.push Treatment projects In January  he moved to London to work in a residential alcohol treatment project where he attained a diploma in alcohol counselling at the University of Kent. The following year he got a job as manager at the alcohol treatment centre, a post he held for four years.When planning toto live in Derry he believed that with a social work qualication he could secure a steady job and therefore applied for the professional social work training course at the University of Ulster.“The best thing about it was that it gave me an academic qualication and also a professional qualication which would allow me to be employed.“I graduated in  and started working right away with the Foyle Health and Social Services Trust in the Leaving and After Care Team, supporting young people who are leaving care and preparing to live independently in the community.”In  he, and local community worker, Frankie McMenamin, established the local charity, Zest, an organisation providing supportive care and counselling to young people struggling with suicidal ideation and self-harm. Maurice managed Zest for  years before leaving to pursue other interests.At the turn of the millennium until  he was part of the first Drug Arrest Referral scheme in Northern Ireland. The scheme was managed by the Western Health and Social Care TrustAlcohol and Dug Service and required daily attendance at the Strand Road Police Station. It was an innovative project through which all persons detained at the police station were offered support to address alcohol and drug problems. googletag.cmd.push PhD studies  In  he was grant aided by the Public Health Agency to undertake a fellowship at Queens University Belfast.His PhD involved “assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes” in Northern Ireland. “A lot of men drop out of these rehabilitation programmes and what research has found is that when these men drop out they actually present as a greater risk to victims compared tothey had never been referred. “Amongst other things, the research established the men who completed the programme stopped drinking before or at the start of the programme, whereas the men who dropped out of the programme had continued to drink alcohol.“Because of the way alcohol affects the brain,you’re not drinking you’re far more alert and your brain can make connections and you can develop insight to understand yourself.“Butyou’re drinking during the week then it slows the brain’s ability to make sense of things.”He is now working to rehabilitate men who have been domestically violent. “We know prison doesn’t work and most of the men never receive the help that they need,” Maurice said. ‘Compassion’ When he ed to the WHSCT from his secondment at Queens University Belfast, Maurice began working as part of the Domestic Violence Team. Here he set up the first group-based and inidualised domestic violence treatment programmes run by the WHSCT. The demands entailed in establishing the new programme meant that it took longer than initially anticipated to finish the PhD.However, this year he successfully completed the PhD which is the culmination of eight and a half years of hard work.Sadly, his parents aren’t alive to share what is a high point on le’s journey but his children and other family members attended the graduation ceremony. “I’m really looking forward to the event, my daughter and son are going with me,” he said.Asked about the lessons he’s learned through his studies and decades of paid and voluntary work, he said: “No matter what sort of problems a person has, human beings have a massive capacity to change but you have to have the right support and help, which has to be provided in a non-judgemental and compassionate manner.“You can condemn behaviour, but not the person. You have to believe in the persons inherent worth and in their ability to bring about the change they need. Change is possible but people need the right support network in place.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They have also been the standard bearers in Ulster and a commanding display against Antrim champions Dunloy saw them lt a third Ulster title. Derry CCCs reformatted structure has breathed a new lease of le into intermediate and junior hurling. Banagher were intermediate champions but, like Lavey and Swatragh before them, they fell short in their Ulster campaign. At junior level, Coleraine were back as champions and romped to Ulster success and join Slaughtneil in the quest for All-Ireland glory next month. googletag.cmd.push  – Daryl McDermott One of the biggest surprises was the fact Sticks has yet to pick up a hurling All-Star, after being selected in the intermediate football team last year. Cool, calm and collected , his puck-outs were the launchpad for Banaghers attacks. Had a slip in their Ulster clash with Naomh Eacuteanna but flawless otherwise and will surely be highly sought out by both John McEvoy and Rory Gallagher. Oisin ODoherty is more than a worthy mention for his Ulster final performance against Dunloy on his comeback. [st All-Star]  – Karl McKaigue The Emmets defender missed out on last years selection but is back to his consistent best. When Ryan Farren scored an early point for Lavey, he was moved across on him and blotted him out. In the final, he was briefed to pick up Niall Ferris and did so with little fuss. He helped keep Middletown to a mere eight points but it was in the Ulster final where he really earned his stripes with an expert shackling of Dunloys Conal Cunning. [th All-Star] googletag.cmd.push  – Paddy Kelly Its a first award since  for the experienced defender who had a selection in the forwards in . He was a vital cog in Derrys defence under John McEvoy and carried his form into club action. Against Ballinascreen in the semi-final, he held Ryan Scullion scoreless. In the final against Slaughtneil he played a captains part. He held Seacute McGuigan scoreless, was immense, repelled attacks and was unlucky to end up on the losing team. [th All-Star]  - Pearse Dallas A first award for the Eoghan Rua defender who caught the eye on their way back to the All-Ireland stage.Of their five championship games, they have shipped just one goal and Dallas has been pivotal to that record. He had a fine outing against Na Magha and hasnt put a foot wrong since, excelling in the Ulster final against Newry Shamrocks – his side’s toughest test to date. [st All-Star]  – Eamon McGill For the second year in a row, Lavey have negotiated the opening round of the senior championship and McGill has been the central figure. Despite defeat to Slaughtneil, he powered his way forward to score Laveys goal.He gets the spot ahead of Mark Lynch, who he edged for man of the match against Banagher. Lavey trailed by seven points but McGills goal led the fightback. When the Feeny men chased the game late on, he was back winning breaking ball in Laveys defence. [nd All-Star]  – Shane McGuigan After being handed a debut by Michael McShane in the  Ulster final defeat to Cushendall, he has been an ever-present in Slaughtneils defence. In a defensive unit thats all about match-ups, he went up against Keelan Molloy in their win over Dunloy. Molloy scored - from play during the season but McGuigan blotted him out and was still able to operate at centre-back. Richie Mullan didnt score from play off him in the county final either. [th All-Star]  – Meehaul McGrath Played at centre-forward as a runner under Collie McGurk for Derry and also had spells up front for his club. In the absence of Paul McNeill, McGrath has been shted back and in his role at wing-back he enjoyed a great season. He kept Corey OReilly to a point from play in the county final. Against Dunloy, he was paired with the strong running and direct Nigel Elliott. He made a goal saving intervention, cut out a dangerous diagonal ball and floated over a point of his own. [nd All-Star] LISTEN - Michael McShane happy for Slaughtneil to silence the doubters...  – Chrissy McKaigue The most decorated player since these awards began, McKaigue picks up a ninth award. In Slaughtneils cause, he leads and everyone follows. He lashed over four points in their facile win over Lavey and in the county final, he shaded a war of attrition against Thomas Brady but he saved his best for last. Once again he was tasked with putting Paul Shiels on the back foot and he did just that with a surging run in the opening moments that set the tone. [th All-Star]  – Gerald Bradley Was hurler of the year in  and followed suit this season. He registered - against Lavey, including the goal that broke them. In the final, it was Bradley who would pop up to win possession after a Kevin Lynchs score. Ballycran didnt play a sweeper against Dunloy but when McShane dropped Bradley back there for the final, his aerial ability and positional sense set them up. Then, of course, there was his monster score to cement his sides early control. [th All-Star and Hurler of the Year]  – Sean Leo McGoldrick A first award for McGoldrick who has been Coleraines ray of light on their march to the All-Ireland semi-final. It took him one game more, but he matched Cormac ODohertys championship tally of -.Ever-accurate from frees, he offered much more and he landed a super point from out on the wing against Newry Shamrocks in the Ulster final after he had his initial shot blocked. Thats the natural instinct he brings. [st All-Star]  – Cormac ODoherty Still only , the Emmets wizard picks up a fth award. By his own standards, he was quiet in the Ulster final but scored the penalty he won himself. His duck that allowed Gerald Bradley to float over the wonder point highlighted his awareness. He scored - as they downed Kevin Lynchs but its the overall link play that sets him apart. He floats between wing and centre forward, while also popping up behind midfield. [th All-Star]  – Brendan Rogers While making his name as a blistering inside forward, this years campaign saw him play on the wing. It forced teams to reshuffle their plans. He was a puck-out target but still ghosted into scoring positions. His side looked in dire straits in the county final before Rogers manoeuvred his way past the converging Kevin Lynchs defence to land the crucial goal. Pulled a save out of Ryan Elliott in the Ulster final and took Kevin Molloy for three points. [th All-Star]  – Niall Ferris Ferry has already picked up three junior football awards in the colours of Drum. He scored in every league game to help Kevin Lynchs into the top two and clinch a semi-final spot.They were pushed to the pin of their collar against Ballinascreen but Ferris weighed in with -. His goal was fortunate but his positioning was perfect to capitalise on an error by Sean McBride to clinched the game. One of two players to score from play off Karl McKaigue. [nd All-Star]  – Tiarnaacuten McHugh McHugh had an impressive  championship. Derry manager John McEvoy liked what he saw and called the youngster into his plans. He led the Kevin Lynchs attack once again and in the final against Slaughtneil he tormented Sean Cassidy with his uncanny knack of winning possession. When Mark Craigs high ball landed in the square, his presence was enough to put off Morgan McEldowney. After half-time he crashed the sliotar to the net to put the Lynchs in the box seat. [st All-Star]  – Jerome McGuigan Michael McShane has a track record of putting his faith in newcomers and McGuigan paid him back with - from play across four championship games. Scored four times against Lavey to nail down his spot for their pressure-cooker final against Kevin Lynchs. Massive in stature but still has a deft first touch. He gave Dunloy a dferent dimension to consider and allowed the Emmets to build a dferent shape to their attack with Rogers at wing-forward. Edges out Banaghers Tiarnaacuten McCloskey.

Banagher were intermediate champions but, like Lavey and Swatragh before them, they fell short in their Ulster campaign. At junior level, Coleraine were back as champions and romped to Ulster success and join Slaughtneil in the quest for All-Ireland glory next month. googletag.cmd.push  – Daryl McDermott One of the biggest surprises was the fact Sticks has yet to pick up a hurling All-Star, after being selected in the intermediate football team last year. Cool, calm and collected , his puck-outs were the launchpad for Banaghers attacks. Had a slip in their Ulster clash with Naomh Eacuteanna but flawless otherwise and will surely be highly sought out by both John McEvoy and Rory Gallagher. Oisin ODoherty is more than a worthy mention for his Ulster final performance against Dunloy on his comeback. [st All-Star]  – Karl McKaigue The Emmets defender missed out on last years selection but is back to his consistent best. When Ryan Farren scored an early point for Lavey, he was moved across on him and blotted him out. In the final, he was briefed to pick up Niall Ferris and did so with little fuss. He helped keep Middletown to a mere eight points but it was in the Ulster final where he really earned his stripes with an expert shackling of Dunloys Conal Cunning. [th All-Star] googletag.cmd.push  – Paddy Kelly Its a first award since  for the experienced defender who had a selection in the forwards in . He was a vital cog in Derrys defence under John McEvoy and carried his form into club action. Against Ballinascreen in the semi-final, he held Ryan Scullion scoreless. In the final against Slaughtneil he played a captains part. He held Seacute McGuigan scoreless, was immense, repelled attacks and was unlucky to end up on the losing team. [th All-Star]  - Pearse Dallas A first award for the Eoghan Rua defender who caught the eye on their way back to the All-Ireland stage.Of their five championship games, they have shipped just one goal and Dallas has been pivotal to that record. He had a fine outing against Na Magha and hasnt put a foot wrong since, excelling in the Ulster final against Newry Shamrocks – his side’s toughest test to date. [st All-Star]  – Eamon McGill For the second year in a row, Lavey have negotiated the opening round of the senior championship and McGill has been the central figure. Despite defeat to Slaughtneil, he powered his way forward to score Laveys goal.He gets the spot ahead of Mark Lynch, who he edged for man of the match against Banagher. Lavey trailed by seven points but McGills goal led the fightback. When the Feeny men chased the game late on, he was back winning breaking ball in Laveys defence. [nd All-Star]  – Shane McGuigan After being handed a debut by Michael McShane in the  Ulster final defeat to Cushendall, he has been an ever-present in Slaughtneils defence. In a defensive unit thats all about match-ups, he went up against Keelan Molloy in their win over Dunloy. Molloy scored - from play during the season but McGuigan blotted him out and was still able to operate at centre-back. Richie Mullan didnt score from play off him in the county final either. [th All-Star]  – Meehaul McGrath Played at centre-forward as a runner under Collie McGurk for Derry and also had spells up front for his club. In the absence of Paul McNeill, McGrath has been shted back and in his role at wing-back he enjoyed a great season. He kept Corey OReilly to a point from play in the county final. Against Dunloy, he was paired with the strong running and direct Nigel Elliott. He made a goal saving intervention, cut out a dangerous diagonal ball and floated over a point of his own. [nd All-Star] LISTEN - Michael McShane happy for Slaughtneil to silence the doubters...  – Chrissy McKaigue The most decorated player since these awards began, McKaigue picks up a ninth award. In Slaughtneils cause, he leads and everyone follows. He lashed over four points in their facile win over Lavey and in the county final, he shaded a war of attrition against Thomas Brady but he saved his best for last. Once again he was tasked with putting Paul Shiels on the back foot and he did just that with a surging run in the opening moments that set the tone. [th All-Star]  – Gerald Bradley Was hurler of the year in  and followed suit this season. He registered - against Lavey, including the goal that broke them. In the final, it was Bradley who would pop up to win possession after a Kevin Lynchs score. Ballycran didnt play a sweeper against Dunloy but when McShane dropped Bradley back there for the final, his aerial ability and positional sense set them up. Then, of course, there was his monster score to cement his sides early control. [th All-Star and Hurler of the Year]  – Sean Leo McGoldrick A first award for McGoldrick who has been Coleraines ray of light on their march to the All-Ireland semi-final. It took him one game more, but he matched Cormac ODohertys championship tally of -.Ever-accurate from frees, he offered much more and he landed a super point from out on the wing against Newry Shamrocks in the Ulster final after he had his initial shot blocked. Thats the natural instinct he brings. [st All-Star]  – Cormac ODoherty Still only , the Emmets wizard picks up a fth award. By his own standards, he was quiet in the Ulster final but scored the penalty he won himself. His duck that allowed Gerald Bradley to float over the wonder point highlighted his awareness. He scored - as they downed Kevin Lynchs but its the overall link play that sets him apart. He floats between wing and centre forward, while also popping up behind midfield. [th All-Star]  – Brendan Rogers While making his name as a blistering inside forward, this years campaign saw him play on the wing. It forced teams to reshuffle their plans. He was a puck-out target but still ghosted into scoring positions. His side looked in dire straits in the county final before Rogers manoeuvred his way past the converging Kevin Lynchs defence to land the crucial goal. Pulled a save out of Ryan Elliott in the Ulster final and took Kevin Molloy for three points. [th All-Star]  – Niall Ferris Ferry has already picked up three junior football awards in the colours of Drum. He scored in every league game to help Kevin Lynchs into the top two and clinch a semi-final spot.They were pushed to the pin of their collar against Ballinascreen but Ferris weighed in with -. His goal was fortunate but his positioning was perfect to capitalise on an error by Sean McBride to clinched the game. One of two players to score from play off Karl McKaigue. [nd All-Star]  – Tiarnaacuten McHugh McHugh had an impressive  championship. Derry manager John McEvoy liked what he saw and called the youngster into his plans. He led the Kevin Lynchs attack once again and in the final against Slaughtneil he tormented Sean Cassidy with his uncanny knack of winning possession. When Mark Craigs high ball landed in the square, his presence was enough to put off Morgan McEldowney. After half-time he crashed the sliotar to the net to put the Lynchs in the box seat. [st All-Star]  – Jerome McGuigan Michael McShane has a track record of putting his faith in newcomers and McGuigan paid him back with - from play across four championship games. Scored four times against Lavey to nail down his spot for their pressure-cooker final against Kevin Lynchs. Massive in stature but still has a deft first touch. He gave Dunloy a dferent dimension to consider and allowed the Emmets to build a dferent shape to their attack with Rogers at wing-forward. Edges out Banaghers Tiarnaacuten McCloskey.

I knew him from gigs and as a customer of Cool Discs when I worked there. More than that though I felt I knew him more through other people’s recollections of him and to deliver the eulogy I give you me and Mickey’s friends.Joe Brown said: “Derry sadly lost a man you don’t meet every day. There was nothing lying beneath, no agendas, no jagged edges. “A rock solid partner to Breige and an inspirational man of music, art and literature. I saw his band Idol Threat with The Undertones a number of times and became friends with him in the early s, going to gigs. “People were drawn to him and the inspirational effect he had on them. I heard so many bands for the first time through his record collection. I’ll always remember Mickey as a man who embraced le and had an incredible gt of bringing people together, loved a party and kept me from going sane Derry feels like a dferent place without him, every now and then nature conjures up someone very unique and special, who so many had barrels of affection for and who’ll be sadly missed by us all”.Mickey Rooney said: “His flat was always open to the outsiders, his heart was open to all no matter what creed or colour and his mind was always open to whatever experiences came his way”.Raymond Gorman said: “There was definitely no one like him, it took real guts to dress as a punk back in the day, it was a very violent time, Mickey was fearless and hated bullies. The last time I spoke to him he was enthusing about his latest music pourchases and gigs he’d been to. I think he’d be annoyed with everyone being too sad about his passing, remember him with the smile he put on your face when you met him”.Louise McIntyre said: “I first knew Mickey as a teenager growing up in the Brandywell, he was in my older brother’s class in school, I never actually got to talk to him back then as he was a quiet sort. “My earliest memory is looking across at Mickey’s backyard flat roof extension roof and seeing him lying up there with a small radio to his ear listening to his music, even then I knew he was dferent   cool. Several years later we crossed paths again and became a true friend he was doing best man at our wedding. He always remembered birthdays and special occasions. “Mickey stood head and shoulders above everyone  in more ways than one. He was an inspiration and a Derry legend. I somehow hope that he knew this, and that Derry will be an emptier place without him. Thanks for the memories Mickey xx”.Liz Brown said: “One of lasting memories Ill carry of Mickey was his genuine love and kindness towards his friends and loved ones. Like gravity, Mickey had an unseen force that pulled people together and kept their feet on the ground”.Paul McCartney paid a touching tribute in the Journal the day of Mickey’s funeral. “As the s began, you’d usually touch base with Mickey in the town centre on a Saturday. He had a band called The Idol Threats and soon the band I played in, Graffiti, ended up regularly supporting them. I don’t think I saw a local group as musically adventurous until That Petrol Emotion came along. It was a million miles apart from The Undertones and The Moondogs and Mickey was crucial to this process. He wasn’t just the drummer - he was the lyricist also. Just as the music was very involving and mysterious, so, too, were the words and song titles - ‘Lonely Beach Now, ‘Postcard from Abroad’ and the legendary ‘Little Green Men on The Moon.Mickey was a kind and generous guy, but also grateful and reciprocal for everything he received. He remembered everyone’s birthday and was always there with a card or gt. He constantly exuded a spirit of fun and that amazing sense of humour of his was just non-stop and incredible - you simply didn’t know what would come next.“Politics  He didn’t do them, and they did not happen in the many get-togethers in his legendary Abercorn Place flat. I think I can genuinely describe him as an “Enemy of Sectarianism”. When Mickey was cruelly affected by ill health in recent years, this sense of civility never eroded. So lucky are many of us for having this wonderful and inspirational human being around for many years”. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

LSC project is a Peace IV funded programme that The Verbal, in partnership with The Housing Executive, are currently delivering. It’s a four-year programme working across Northern Ireland delivering Reading Rooms to ious cross communities. As the event coincided with International Human Rights Day, guests were also treated to a fascinating workshop led by Roberta Bacic, curator of ‘Embracing Human Rights’ exhibition.  The exhibition uses textiles, namely ‘arpilleras’ to depict a iety of themes including local and international issues, human rights issues and the experience of new communities. As part of the event, which was held on Tuesday, volunteers also took part in a festive-themed Reading Rooms session before having lunch together. Speaking following the event, LSC Programme Director, Andrea Doran said: “Our LSC project is about maximising meaningful community integration by working with others, giving back to the community and developing awareness and understanding. We used Tuesday’s event to give something back to the people who make it possible for us to deliver our programme. We felt that International Human Rights Day was a fitting day to do this.” Concluding, Mrs Doran said: “I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our fantastic volunteers who have worked tirelessly throughout the year to bring communities together. What they have achieved in the short le-time of the project is remarkable. We’re really looking forward to continuing that great work with all our LSC volunteers and groups in the new year.”Gareth Doran, Housing Executive Listen Share Change Northern Sector Co-Ordinator, has also been working with the LSC Project to deliver the Reading Rooms model in the Northern sector. He said: “The first year of this project has been a massive success, and I would like to thank all the groups for their participation in Listen Share Change year one programme and hopefully continuing to engage with them into year two.“Special thanks must go to all the volunteers for the time they invested in the project, their contribution has been amazing,” he said.

LSC project is a Peace IV funded programme that The Verbal, in partnership with The Housing Executive, are currently delivering. It’s a four-year programme working across Northern Ireland delivering Reading Rooms to ious cross communities. As the event coincided with International Human Rights Day, guests were also treated to a fascinating workshop led by Roberta Bacic, curator of ‘Embracing Human Rights’ exhibition.  The exhibition uses textiles, namely ‘arpilleras’ to depict a iety of themes including local and international issues, human rights issues and the experience of new communities. As part of the event, which was held on Tuesday, volunteers also took part in a festive-themed Reading Rooms session before having lunch together. Speaking following the event, LSC Programme Director, Andrea Doran said: “Our LSC project is about maximising meaningful community integration by working with others, giving back to the community and developing awareness and understanding. We used Tuesday’s event to give something back to the people who make it possible for us to deliver our programme. We felt that International Human Rights Day was a fitting day to do this.” Concluding, Mrs Doran said: “I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our fantastic volunteers who have worked tirelessly throughout the year to bring communities together. What they have achieved in the short le-time of the project is remarkable. We’re really looking forward to continuing that great work with all our LSC volunteers and groups in the new year.”Gareth Doran, Housing Executive Listen Share Change Northern Sector Co-Ordinator, has also been working with the LSC Project to deliver the Reading Rooms model in the Northern sector. He said: “The first year of this project has been a massive success, and I would like to thank all the groups for their participation in Listen Share Change year one programme and hopefully continuing to engage with them into year two.“Special thanks must go to all the volunteers for the time they invested in the project, their contribution has been amazing,” he said.

The competition aims to encourage interest in Mandarin Chinese language and Chinas culture, with Mandarin ranked as one of the most vital languages to the UK over the next twenty years.This is the third year the competition has taken place in the North and saw entrants from both groups and iniduals, with abilities ranging from beginner to advanced. Speaking at the competition was Jonathan Stewart, director, British Council Northern Ireland.“Congratulations to all of the pupils from Lumen Christi College who took to the stage today speaking in Mandarin. “Like last year, the standards during today’s heat were very high and we hope again to see some of the students in London for the UK final. This competition allows pupils to demonstrate the hard work and effort they have put into learning Mandarin. It’s really important that more young people have the chance to learn languages such as Mandarin, which provides an important insight into dferent ways of thinking and living. Languages open up exciting study, travel and work opportunities in our increasingly interconnected world.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He said:“Paddy Nixon has led Ulster University during a challenging time for the organisation and for higher education in Northern Ireland.

Lumen captain Mark Chester hold the Nannary Cup However, clear cut chances were at a premium as the game often got bogged down around the midfield area as players were hesitant to kick it long because of the windy conditions. googletag.cmd.push As the half wore on, Lumen were definitely the stronger side but had yet to convert that supremacy into scores. However, shortly before the half-time break, they got the breakthrough that they deserved. After some neat passing in the half forward line, midfielder Flionn McLaughlin broke through the Inver full back line and smashed the ball into the net, leaving the half-time score at - to - in favour of the Derry team. As the second-half got underway, Lumen would have been hoping to take advantage of the wind and they quickly went about doing to. Two points from Cathal Deery opened up a three-point gap and it looked like Lumen were getting ready to finish off their opponents. However, the game then swung on a pivotal moment. Inver were awarded a penalty and a goal wouldve levelled the game but the Inver penalty taker crashed his shot off the post. It was the boost Lumen needed but the next score was crucial and it soon arrived in Lumen’s favour through another well-taken goal from Flionn McLaughlin. His fellow midfielder Eoin Canavan then got in on the act, scoring a goal and a point to open up a comfortable lead for Lumen.Inver, to their credit, never gave up and continued battling in the closing stages. However, they were unable to register any more scores and Lumen held on to take the title.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers.

All ended happily ever after, however, as both families moved towards the darkness and embraced who they really were.Featuring an exceptional live orchestra led by Head of Music Celeste McEvoy and music teacher Ciara Coleman, and with magnicent set, costume, lighting and sound complementing the breathtaking musical and dramatic talent of these students, it really was a show not to be missed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Post Office remains  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Ballynahinch will continue to have access to a first class Post Office service in the New Year after all.Days after it was suggested that the current office in Lisburn Street would close temporarily on January , it was confirmed this week that there will be no break in service.The current postmistress will vacate her position on January  with M Retail Ltd taking over the service the following day.Mrs Donna Carlisle mdash who is the current postmistress mdash said everything will continue as normal in the New Year and that there will be no interruption to services.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who said last week that it was his understanding that the Ballynahinch Post Office was to close temporarily, is delighted that normal service is to continue.He said post offices are at the heart of communities and are used by a wide range of people, in particular the elderly, who enjoy the face-to-face contact with staff.ldquoBallynahinch is the districtrsquos third largest town and I am pleased that there will be no interruption to postal services, he continued.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices rather than banks.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites. Theyrsquore a good side with some quality players, especially in midfield and can be lethal going forward, but so can we.

In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening.

But it is only the only project.ldquoThere is quite a lot we can achieve in other areas, on and off the fields of play. Coaching, refereeing, administration, club development and fundraising will also require our attention, he added.ldquoAnd we also want to have the ambition for our teams to reach their potential and challenge for honours. So, the future has real potential for us, but it will require a lot of support, goodwill and a unity of purpose across the county.

Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case. However, the one-way system for Downpatrick town centre was considered by Transport NI who have advised that this is not viable.The spokeswoman also confirmed that a report was tabled to the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourismlast month which considered the future opportunities for visitor information centres within the district.She added: ldquo This report was held lsquoin committeersquo and no decisions have been made by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with regards to the closures of existing visitor information centres.

As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for.

I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult.

Yet in Kafaesque style that element of the talks has been as secretive the Stormont which existed until January .Arlene Foster, Michelle O’Neill and senior civil servants talk about mending their ways and acting to such basic standards of government as minute-taking and obeying the law.Yet it takes greatfaith to believe that largely the same people running largely the same system will produce a markedly dferent result.Anne Graham: I was touched that students wanted to remember my brother Edgar, decades after he was murdered Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"We should be sceptical rather than cynical and it is possible that there has been a genuine damascene conversion. The greatest incentive towards improved behaviour is the glimpse of public fury which politicians and civil servants observed over the RHI scandal – followed by the recent electoral punishment for the DUP and Sinn Fein.Allied to that is the realisation that the practices of Stormont ultimately proved destructive. What might in a state of hubris have seemed than an untopplable institution in which the DUP and Sinn Féin would forever be joint masters now must look very dferent on the other side of the RHI Inquiry’s probing into dark corners and three years of powerlessness.However, there is at least one reason to believe thatStormont s in coming weeks it could be even less productive than that which spectacularly imploded three years ago.In , for the first time since , Stormont finally came to have an official opposition, ending a position in which all but a handful of MLAs were members of governing parties.The SDLP, UUP and Alliance joined smaller parties such as the TUV and People Before Profit in sitting outside the government. Thanks to the enterprising John McCallister, Stormont’s rules were changed to ensure speaking time for the opposition and the ability to ask questions of Stormont ministers.What in any other society would be considered the basic building blocks of a democratic system radically altered how Stormont ed, evenmost of us could not fully see that at the time.Recently the respected think tank the Institute for Government published a report on the Stormont vacuum. The authors spent time talking to senior Stormont civil servants and buried in their final report is this fascinating line: “The decision of the UUP and SDLP not to join the last administration created [an opposition] for the first time – exposing the executive to a degree of accountability that officials told us ministers found uncomfortable.”For the first time, the Assembly became a chamber which wielded real power of its own, showing that executive power is only one form of governmental influence. Rather than being subservient to the Executive, the Assembly asserted itself as a genuine forum for debate and for minsters being held to account.Although uncomfortable, that was ultimately in the Executive’s strategic interests it would only surviveseen to be part of a credible institution rather than one which articially shut down challenge. But such a change carried risk for parties unused to such scrutiny and their handling of the new reality exposed the Executive’s inadequacies.It is unlikely that Stormont would have fallen over the RHI scandal had it not been for an opposition harrying ministers, demanding answers, calling witnesses before hearings of Stormont committees and providing an alternative administration.Some people – including perhaps some people in the NIO – might say that the collapse of Stormont is a good argument against opposition.But that is a simplistic understanding of the scale of Stormont’s problems. The entire edice was built on sand andit had not fallen over RHI, it was probably inevitable that collapse would come over something  – and the longer spads, ministers and civil servants acted as they did unchecked, the more destructive they became.\u2028The opposition parties had less than a year and, with the exception of Alliance, fared poorly in the Assembly election following collapse.For that reason, they appear keen to go back in to a new Executive – and Sinn Féin in particular appears desperate to ensure that the SDLP commits to doing so, itself a hint of Sinn Féin concern at facing full-throated criticism rather than the necessarily muted iety possible from a government partner.If that happens, then ironically a Stormont which fell in large part because of secrecy and a lack of accountability could be more secretive and less accountable.And regardless of what happens with the smaller parties, a new Executive is likely to be weaker at the top. Arlene Foster is a greatly diminished figure from the politician who once presided over Stormont like a queen and who – it is now almost forgotten – was for almost a year an exceptionally popular leader of unionism.Wounded after last week’s latest electoral disaster and fighting internally for her career as ious DUP sharks circle, Mrs Foster is both weak within unionism and a leader who is now instinctively loathed by most nationalists.Similarly, Michelle O’Neill carries none of the gravitas of Martin McGuinness and is now in an unprecentedly weak position for a Sinn Fein leader, with a third of her party having recently voted against her and in favour of John O’Dowd while she has shown an inability to make the sort of grand reconciling gestures which became associated with Mr McGuinness in his latter years.This week the efforts at the talks, such as we can discern, appear to be around issues such as an Irish language act and reform of the petition of concern, something which is almost tangential to the scale of the problem.Much is at stake: If devolution is rushed back and fails again, the public may not give it a third chance.try catch  TrendingMan dies after serious two vehicle collision -

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
