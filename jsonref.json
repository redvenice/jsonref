How is this ‘natural’? Stop photoshopping, you’re beautiful without it.’Someone else said: ‘Learn to edit your pics properly you look disfigured!!!!’But over all of the negative comments, there were people who stuck up for Lauren, as her bud Pascal Craymer said: ‘SERIOUSLY give it up on the photoshop comments, If you have nothing nice to say be quiet!’To which Lauren replied: ‘I take it as a compliment. looool’This isn’t the first time the reality star has been called out over editing her photos.Just last week her eagle-eyed followers spotted another picture that might have been tampered with as some thought the mirror looked wonky.In the snap she can be seen doing leg lifts at a gym as she showed off some swanky fitness gear.She captioned the piece: ‘Today’s workout with @glam_physiques and I absolutely love it wearing my @so.monroe fitness gear #bodytraining #core #balance #weights #dead #sweat #strength #strong.’However, fans weren’t falling for it and suggested that she’d tweaked some of the shots for a slimmer waist.Towie recap: Gatsby\u0027s caught in a storm while Dean and Amber go on a dateWho is Towie\u0027s Liam \u0027Gatsby\u0027 Blackwell - age, net worth and familySomeone wrote: ‘Ummmm.

I started Facebook, I run it, and I’m responsible for what happens here,’ he said, in words from a prepared statement.Zuckerberg accepted personal responsibility for the leak of users’ data (Picture: AP)Mr Zuckerberg said its audit of third-party apps would highlight any misuse of personal information, and said the company would alert users instantly if it ‘found anything suspicious’.When asked why the company did not immediately alert the 87 million users whose data may have been accessed by Cambridge Analytica (CA) when first told about the ‘improper’ usage in 2015, Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook considered it a ‘closed case’ after CA said it had deleted it.CA insists it deleted the data harvested by Professor Aleksandr Kogan’s personality quiz app as soon as it was informed it breached Facebook’s terms of use.Culture Secretary Matt Hancock will meet Facebook representatives in London on Wednesday.Facebook and Cambridge Analytica face multiple lawsuits over alleged misuse of personal information with at least five law firms in the UK and US investigating claims for compensation.Mr Zuckerberg said its audit of third-party apps would highlight any misuse of personal information (Picture: AP)On the subject of fake news, Mr Zuckerberg said ‘one of my greatest regrets in running the company’ was its slowness at uncovering and acting against disinformation campaigns by Russian trolls during the US election.He said the Russian campaign of disinformation had been discovered ‘right around the time’ of the US presidential election, and said the company had developed ‘new AI tools’ to identify fake accounts responsible.But he said: ‘They are going to keep getting better at this and we need to invest in keeping on getting better at this too.’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_6853394.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"mark zuckerberg needed extra cushion appearance senate","story":"Mark Zuckerberg’s billionaire backside got a boost for the hearing (Picture: AP)Mark Zuckerberg appeared to have a booster seat for his hearing at the US senate into Facebook’s handling of private information.The website’s founder, who is 5’7″ tall, sat on the cushion throughout the hearing to give his height a bit of a boost.One person comented: ‘Someone said Zooker was actually sitting on a whoopie cushion, but he is so full of air himself, that the whoopie never deflated.’Zuckerberg faced a five-hour grilling from his leather seat and cushion, answering hundreds of questions.One that he refused to answer was whether he would share details of the hotel where he stayed the night before.Another was relating to whether he would reveal who he had messaged in the last week.At least five law firms in the UK and US are investigating claims for compensation after thousands used an app which collected data about users and their Facebook friends.Facebook began notifying 87 million people worldwide, including nearly 1.1 million Britons, that their personal information on the platform may have been given to Cambridge Analytica (CA), a UK consultancy accused of using personal data to help politicians target advertising around elections.Mark Zuckerberg is 5’7″ tall so got a boost to make himself look taller (Picture: AP)CA maintains the total number is closer to 30 million, and insists it did not ‘illegally or inappropriately’ collect or share the data. It adds that it licensed data ‘on iniduals in the United States only’ and deleted it once it was told Facebook’s terms of use had been broken.Facebook insists it has not broken any laws, but the tech giant’s founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg admitted last week that the company ‘didn’t do enough’ to prevent firms using his platform ‘for harm’.Crafty crow plucks giant panda\u0027s backside to furnish his nestMr Zuckerberg will continue to answer questions from US Congress today over the scandal of how users’ data may have been used by CA to help Donald Trump’s election campaign target voters.Ravi Naik, from ITN Solicitors in London which is pursuing legal action on behalf of clients, said: ‘Facebook has taken the first step to accountability, which is accepting there is a problem. But they need to explain what they are going to do to compensate people for the breaches and remedy the problem.’Lawyers from ITN Solicitors, Leigh Day and McCue \u0026amp Partners in the UK, and RuyakCherian, Fields and Cross \u0026amp Simon in the US are all pursuing legal action on behalf of clients.Zuckerberg leaves after a joint hearing of the Commerce and Judiciary Committees on Capitol Hill in Washington (Picture: AP)Mr Naik said his firm will be seeking clarification about how Facebook knows which users were affected by the breach and exactly what information was transferred.A number of people posted screengrabs of messages they had received from the social network on Tuesday, saying either that they were unaffected, or that their information may have been harvested as a result of them or one or more of their friends using the quiz app This Is Your Digital Life, from which the information was collected.Matt Rose, who runs a marketing and content agency in London, said he did not receive a notification from Facebook, as the firm had promised, and only found out his personal information had ended up in the hands of CA after looking for it himself.He told the Press Association: ‘I think we are all used to knowing that the actions we take online are monitored, but not that the actions other people take can have a direct effect on us and our data, whether we like it or not.’In telling users if they were affected, Facebook says the ‘public profile, Page likes, birthday and current city’ was ‘likely shared’ through the app, but added: ‘A small number of people who logged into This Is Your Digital Life also shared their own News Feed, timeline, posts and messages which may have included posts and messages from you. They may also have shared your hometown.’Facebook stopped allowing app developers to collect information from users’ friends in 2014. It declined to comment on the proposed legal action."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/905034900.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=100\u0026amp;h=75\u0026amp;crop=1\" data-aspect=\"1.3274336283186\" class=\"thumbnail-link-image\" data-rewritten=\"false\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"mor-title","title":"rickshaw driver confronted charging couple 150 1 5 mile ride","story":"A rickshaw driver has been confronted in central London after he tried to charge two tourists £150 for a 1.5 mile journey that took just nine minutes.The footage was shot in Knightsbridge at 7pm on Monday after the trip from Selfridges on Oxford Street.National Pet Day: How many pets are there in the UK?The rickshaw driver does not appear to like being filmed and lunges at the person holding the camera outside the Sheraton Park Tower Hotel.He shouts ‘don’t touch me, don’t touch me’ as people confront him over the exorbitant fee.Eventually the couple give him £25 for the ride.The driver was eventually given £25 for the nine-minute journeyThe man who filmed the incident said: ‘I felt really sorry for them as the guy was threatening them to make the payment of £150.‘I was filming him and he started to snatch my mobile phone, I was very upset.’He said: ‘I don’t come cheap. I work my legs hard, I look good and I play good music – you have to pay a lot if you want that kind of luxury.‘I charged £206 because there were four people and I was going uphill.

B******ks.\u0027Always has been b*****ks and it remains it.\u0027We know very well that we cannot have the exact same benefits and actually it would have made sense - because it was the Tories that said they were going to secure the exact same benefits - and our position should have been to say they have said they are going to secure the exact same benefits and we are going to hold them to that standard.\u0027He was slapped down by the Labour spokesperson who said: \u0027Labour has set six tests for the final Brexit deal. \u0027Those include holding the Government to its own commitment to deliver the same benefits as the single market and customs union. \u0027We have been clear that, if those tests are not met, Labour will not back it in Parliament. Barry Gardiner fully supports that position.\u0027The row comes as the UK marks the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, which brought decades of sectarian violence and bloodshed to an end.  But Northern Ireland is again in a political crisis after powersharing collapsed over a year ago.The DUP and Sinn Fein have been at loggerheads over a range of issues including a proposed Irish language Act. And No10 has warned that Westminster could have to step in and impose direct rule on the region for the first time in more than a decade. Mr Blair today said Theresa May must give the Northern Ireland peace process her \u0027full focus\u0027 to end the current impasse, Tony Blair warned today.The ex-Labour PM said the Good Friday Agreement had been the start of a long journey away from the Troubles.And he warned that the process still needed the \u0027full focus\u0027 of the current Prime Minister at the most crucial moments.Devolved powersharing in Belfast has been on ice for more than a year after a breakdown in relations between the Unionist DUP and Republican Sinn Fein.Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has warned that the hand of history will be \u0027heavy and unforgiving\u0027 if Brexit is allowed to \u0027undermine\u0027 the Good Friday Agreement.           Tony Blair voiced disbelief at the remark made by Barry Gardiner, saying \u0027I don\u0027t know how anyone can say that\u0027The former US secretary of state - whose husband Bill helped create the 1998 peace deal, which was signed 20 years ago today - said that reinstating a hard border would be an \u0027enormous setback\u0027 that could lead to a return to the \u0027bad old days\u0027.Britain and the EU are yet to find a solution to the question of whether there will be a hard border between the UK and Ireland after Brexit. Progress is due by the summer and failure strike an agreement acceptable to Dublin could scupper hopes of any deal at the crucial October summit. Mr Corbyn  said: \u0027The Good Friday Agreement was a defining moment in Irish history which allowed peace to prevail. It was a great achievement and I pay tribute to the work done by Tony Blair, Mo Mowlam and Paul Murphy, as well as those on all sides in Ireland, north and south, in achieving the crucial breakthrough of the peace process.\u0027No one wants to be marking the twentieth anniversary of the agreement while the assembly at Stormont remains suspended. Efforts must be redoubled to restore the assembly, and to ensure a lasting open border as part of the Brexit negotiations.\u0027There must be no return to a hard border between north and south, and no return to the horrors of the troubles. All of us on both sides of the Irish Sea have a responsibility to maintain hope for the future.\u0027The history of Ireland is a great teacher of oppression and brutality, imagination and poetry. For Irish communities everywhere – including in my own constituency – the Good Friday Agreement will always embody their hopes for peace and justice. We must cherish and learn from it for the future.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/07/15/4AE9102D00000578-0-image-a-67_1523110287365.jpg","title":"Charity couple invite Harry Meghans Royal Wedding","story":"Manchester Arena bombing survivor Amelia Thompson, 12, pictured left at the Ariana Grande concert before the attack and right present day, will also be at the major event and said she was \u0027speechless\u0027 when she heard the newsThe lucky group were nominated by the nine regional Lord Lieutenant offices after Harry and Meghan asked for those picked to come from a broad range of backgrounds and ages, including young people who have shown strong leadership, and those who have served their communities. Kensington Palace announced the group would be among the crowds allowed into the grounds of Windsor Castle to share in the atmosphere of the May 19 wedding at St George\u0027s Chapel.

Prince Harry interviews former US President Barack Obama as part of his guest editorship of BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme in December‘This is very much about them getting married surrounded by their families and friends,’ a source said.‘It is not a big state occasion in any way. It is an intimate family wedding. Well, as intimate as a royal wedding can be.’The prince’s spokesman said the Queen backed her grandson’s decision not to invite politicians or foreign dignitaries for the sake of it.          The couple have decided not to invite any political leaders both from the UK and abroad, which means that even British Prime Minister Theresa May isn\u0027t on the list. Pictured is Prince Harry and Barack Obama at the Invictus Games in Canada last yearKensington Palace said: ‘It has been decided that an official list of political leaders – both UK and international – is not required for Prince Harry and Miss Markle’s wedding. Her Majesty’s Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by The Royal Household.’ Government sources said Theresa May ‘wasn’t expecting an invitation’.Despite the wedding being an important national occasion, Harry is not in the direct line of succession – unlike his elder brother, Prince William, who had no choice but to invite dozens of politicians and Commonwealth representatives to his 2011 Westminster Abbey nuptials.Harry is currently fifth in line to the throne, but after the birth of his third niece or nephew later this month, will slip to sixth, behind the Cambridges’ three children.Prince Harry and Miss Markle have also chosen a much smaller venue than William and Kate, who were able to fit around 1,200 guests into Westminster Abbey, including then-Prime Minister David Cameron.

But what is the Belfast Agreement?What is the Good Friday Agreement?The Good Friday Agreement helped to end 30 years of sectarian conflict, that were also known as \u0027The Troubles\u0027. This conflict began when Northern Ireland separated from the rest of Ireland in the 1920s and away from British rule.Northern Ireland was then ided in two groups, the Unionists or the Loyalists, who wanted to remain a part of the UK and the Nationalists or the Republicans, who preferred the independence. Catholics protested after being discriminated against in the predominantly Protestant north and from the 1970s, violence erupted between armed groups on both sides. British troops were sent to the area, but came up against the largest of the Republican groups, the Irish Republican Army, or the IRA.The IRA bombed areas of Britain and Northern Ireland and Loyalists in groups like the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) were also responsible for many deaths. In 1972, the situation became markedly more serious as the IRA began targeting police officers and British army soldiers on the street.  Davis: The border impasse has become harder to resolve since Leo Varadkar became Irish PM14 people were killed by British troops during a peaceful protest led by the Catholics and Republicans in Derry and in a day that became known as Bloody Sunday, dampening hope that Northern Ireland would ever be peaceful again.However, in the 1990s, the IRA announced a ceasefire and after two years of discussions and 30 years of the Troubles, the Good Friday agreement was signed.A new government was formed with power being shared between the Unionists and the Nationalists in a group called the Northern Ireland Assembly. Every house in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was sent a copy of the agreement before the referendum was held in May 1998.The two countries voted in favour of the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland Assembly took their seats in December. However, those who were against the peace, continued violence and in 2002, the Assembly was suspended and the UK government had to take over decision-making.In 2007, power was returned and the British army ended its operations in Northern Ireland, but ten years later, the deal collapsed and has yet to be restored.When was the Belfast Agreement signed?The Belfast Agreement was signed on Friday, April 10, 1998 at 5:30pm and on the day the deal was reached, US Special Envoy for Northern Ireland George Mitchell stated: ‘I am pleased to announce that the two governments and the political parties in Northern Ireland have reached an agreement.’Who signed the Good Friday Agreement?The Good Friday Agreement was signed by Prime Minister Tony Blair, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, SDLP leader John Hume, Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams, Sinn Féin member Martin McGuinness and Labour Party politician Marjorie \u0027Mo\u0027 Mowlam.          David Davis said the Irish government had been influenced by Sinn Féin in its Brexit policyWhy did the DUP oppose the Belfast Agreement?Despite the GFA deal gaining widespread support across Ireland, Ian Paisley’s DUP was the only major party to oppose it, believing it would scupper a union between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.However, distrust between parties caused problems when the agreement was first put in place, but Tony Blair managed to win over Ian Paisley. Issues also arose in 2017 when Martin McGuinness resigned as Sinn Fein deputy first minister after accusing the DUP of ‘arrogance’ while handling an energy scheme.The DUP’s Arlene Foster resigned and the Assembly collapsed, with McGuinness dying later in March 2017. Despite offers of help from Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, the DUP and Sinn Fein remain at loggerheads.Speaking in Belfast on April 10 2018, former DUP leader Peter Robinson said that he was ‘right to oppose’ the Belfast Agreement.‘Most people when they talk about the Belfast Agreement are talking about a wider process - it seems to have taken on some of the events that took place almost four years before it and every agreement that happened afterwards.‘So if we are talking about a process that has at its heart compromise, partnership, people working together to make progress, then I think the whole community should support that. The specifics of the Belfast Agreement itself, clearly I opposed - I think I was right in opposing it.’Does the Tory-DUP alliance affect the Good Friday Agreement? Despite the UK government remaining impartial when dealing with the unionists and the nationalists, a direct alliance with the DUP would change this. Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams warned that a Tory-DUP alliance would lead to a \u0027coalition of chaos\u0027 and could put the GFA at risk. Alongside this, when writing for The Guardian, Jonathan Powell, the chief negotiator at the Belfast Agreement talks, said that the partnership was \u0027a terrible mistake with lasting consequences\u0027 that \u0027would risk undermining 20 years of hard work\u0027.Will Brexit be affected by the Belfast Agreement?Brexit secretary David Davis\u0027s comments about the Irish government being influenced by Sinn Féin in Britain\u0027s withdrawal from the EU could present some issues if a hard border is proposed. While Britain, Ireland and the EU have all stated that they want to avoid a hard border, many believe this is not possible with Theresa May\u0027s promise of a frictionless border while also leaving the EU customs border.While the DUP oppose a united Ireland as an alternative to remaining in the EU, Sinn Fein are touting it and officials fear that a return to before the Good Friday Agreement could occur, according to The Guardian. Former US Special Envoy for Northern Ireland George Mitchell warned that direct rule and a hard border could lead to a return of the violence seen from the 1970s on BBC\u0027s Today programme. George Mitchell said that a hard border would result in \u0027stereotyping resuming, demonisation resuming and people turn inward\u0027, and a lack of power-sharing could lead to \u0027regressive forces\u0027 becoming violent again.Leaders should see this as a \u0027dangerous signal...and act before there is a regression,\u0027 he added.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/03/15/04A301F4000003E8-0-image-a-175_1522766360623.jpg","title":"Charity owner praises Peter Kay used comeback appearance raise 35 000 children","story":"    Peter Kay, 44, who made a shock appearance in Blackpool on SaturdayA grieving mother has thanked Peter Kay for raising £34,000 for her charity after he made a shock appearance at a screening of his hit comedy Car Share, calling him \u0027a real star\u0027.The comedian had not been seen since cancelling his sell-out UK tour due to \u0027unforeseen family circumstances\u0027.But the 44-year-old stunned fans by appearing on stage at Blackpool Opera house on Saturday night as new episodes of his sitcom Car Share were aired.The Bolton-born Phoenix Nights star told the delighted crowd at the special fundraiser: \u0027Thanks for coming!\u0027And now campaigner Liz Curtis from Warlingham, Surrey, has thanked Kay for raising a staggering £34,000 for her charity The Lily Foundation.Liz, 43, set up the charity in 2007 to raise awareness of incurable mitochondrial disease, an inherited chronic illness.Peter Kay adds a THIRD screening of new Car Share episode...Share this articleHer eight-month-old daughter Lily died from the condition, which causes physical, developmental, cognitive and learning disabilities, organ failure and seizures.\u0027We can\u0027t thank Peter and his team enough for this incredibly generous donation.

The main thing is the train drivers coming in must not be shocked, and so you can’t use some colours, no red or green or yellow.”Health and safety meant the letters had to use LEDs rather than her usual neon, but they were always going to be pink, she said.“At night the whole station will be bathed in a pink light, and it will make people happy, I promise you, it will make people smile because pink will make them feel good.”Interviewed on the BBC’s Today programme, Emin gave no more clues about her weekend revelation that she had once been sexually assaulted by “a well-known female artist” who had attempted to grab her crotch at a party. Emin had responded by threatening to “punch her lights out”. Women should have the confidence to respond to any such assault at the time, she told John Humphrys: “I shouted and I caused such a scene, and I told everybody what she had done, much to their humiliation and embarrassment. I don’t think they’ll be doing that again in a hurry.”“Everybody is making accusations and saying things about men, but it happens with everybody in many different circumstances – people don’t seem to be seeing the whole picture that harassment is actually bullying in a lot of cases as well.”The St Pancras light work is a commission from the station owner and the Royal Academy, and will be seen by an estimated 50 million travellers over the year. Tim Marlow, the artistic director of the Royal Academy, called Emin one of the most important and influential artists in the world. “Her work is intense and compelling and blurs the boundaries between the personal and the public and between art and life,” he said.After time in the station Emin said she hoped the piece might find a home in Europe – or in her native Margate.Apart from wrapping her arms around Europe, Emin said she hoped one day her words could have a more personal resonance: “I desperately hope to be met at the train station in a really romantic way – one day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16356adb2d7956e6a46aeb79122fe860fa655464/0_0_2942_4200/master/2942.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e54af2dc60c287e5c52d3ba12406017 480w","title":"seven types atheism john gray review atheist believer material world","story":"An an impressively erudite work, ranging from St Augustine to Joseph Conrad, embraces an atheism that finds enough mystery in the material worldThere has been a rash of books in recent years by thinkers for whom the human race is getting nicer and nicer. Richard Dawkins, Steven Pinker, Matt Ridley and Sam Harris are rational humanists who believe in progress, however many famines and genocides may disfigure the planet. We are en route to a vastly improved future. Perhaps this return to the values of the western Enlightenment is not unrelated to the threat of radical Islam. The philosopher John Gray’s role has been to act as a Jeremiah among these Pollyannas, insisting that we are every bit as nasty as we ever were. If there is anything he detests, it is schemes of visionary transformation. He is a card-carrying misanthrope for whom human life has no unique importance, and for whom history has been little more than the sound of hacking and gouging. One might note that Christianity is as pessimistic as Gray but a lot more hopeful as well.The answer to the question of whether history has been improving is surely a decisive yes and no. For Marx, the modern age was both an enthralling emancipation and one long nightmare. The wide-eyed optimism of Pinker or Ridley is just as one-sided as the prophets of doom who refuse to concede that there is something to be said for such modern inventions as feminism, spin-dryers and antibiotics. The truth is that everyone believes in progress, but only a dwindling band of Victorian relics such as Dawkins believe in Progress. So this book is really hammering at an open door. How many champions of a vastly improved future are there in a postmodern culture?Gray also believes that humanists are in bad faith. Most of them are atheists, but all they have done is substitute humanity for God. They thus remain in thrall to the very religious faith they reject. In fact, most supposedly secular thought in Gray’s view is repressed religion, from the liberalism of John Locke to the millenarian visions of the Jacobins and Bolsheviks. The popular belief that atheism and religion are opposites is, in his view, a mistake. Gray also takes a swipe at the kind of atheism that sees religion as a primitive stab at understanding the universe, one that science will later replace. Gray, to his credit, sees that religions are not theories of the world but forms of life. They are less systems of belief than acts of faith. Fanatical God-haters such as the Marquis de Sade, Dostoevsky and the literary critic William Empson are also sent packing as no more than inverted believers. (God, Empson wrote with an agreeable flourish, “is the wickedest thing yet invented by the black heart of man”.) What remains is the kind of atheism that renounces God while having a low estimate of humanity. Since you could probably find this in most Oxbridge senior common rooms, it is hardly the most mind-shaking of conclusions.Unlike the rational humanists, Gray takes a dim view of reason. Yet although reason does not go all the way down in human affairs, without it we perish. He is right that there can be no perfect society, but wrong to imagine that things could not feasibly be a good deal better than they are. He relishes the folly of humankind while discreetly skating over its stupendous virtues. He also dwells on the racism of the 18th-century Enlightenment while remaining silent about its passion for freedom and justice. He seems not to recognise that his own gloomy outlook reflects less some universal truth than the dark times in which we live. One of his heroes is the 19th-century thinker Arthur Schopenhauer, perhaps the most morose philosopher who ever lived, for whom human life is driven by an insatiable, voracious Will, the world is an illusion and the whole of human history a blood-soaked battleground. Gray would rather embrace meaninglessness than the absolute truths of the political utopianists. The only question is why he should posit such an absurdly polarised choice in the first place.Gray belongs to that group of contemporary thinkers, of whom George Steiner is the doyen, who disdain the secular but can’t quite drag themselves to the church or synagogue. They turn, instead, to a kind of transcendence without content, of which there is no finer example than what one might call Hollywood spirituality. Those celebrities who dabble in Kabbalah or Scientology do so as a refuge from a material world crammed with too many chauffeurs, masseurs, bank accounts and swimming pools. The spiritual for them is the opposite of the material, a mistake that Gray also makes in his less luxury-laden way. This is not the view of Judaeo-Christianity. When Jesus speaks of salvation in terms of feeding the hungry and visiting the sick, he speaks as a devout Jew, for whom the spiritual is in the first place a matter of how one behaves towards others. Those who seek some otherworldly comfort in religion are apparently deaf to Jesus’s warning to his followers that if they were true to his word they would meet with the same fate as himself.Another aspect of Judaism is its iconoclasm. You are forbidden to make images of God, because the only image of God is human flesh and blood. But since the Jewish God is the God of the future, you are equally prohibited from making graven images of what is still to come. Besides, if you can represent the future here and now, then it can’t be the future. Gray, with his aversion to utopian blueprints, would surely agree. What he might be slower to concede is that the only image of the future is the failure of the present. The task of the Old Testament prophet is to remind his people that unless they change their ways here and now, protecting the poor from the violence of the rich and providing for the widows and the orphans, there won’t be any future worth having. Marx, a secular Jew who urged his wife to read the Hebrew scriptures, was true to this ban on visions of the future. In fact, his work is notorious for how little it has to say about the nature of communism. For a writer who began his career in fierce contention with utopian thought, this is hardly surprising. Nor is it surprising that the viscerally anti-Marxist Gray doesn’t see fit to mention it.Seven Types of Atheism is an impressively erudite work, ranging from the Gnostics to Joseph Conrad, St Augustine to Bertrand Russell. In the end, it settles for a brand of atheism that finds enough mystery in the material world itself without needing to supplement it with a higher one. Yet this, too, is just as much a throwback to the Victorian age as Dawkins’s evangelical campaign against religious evangelism. Authors such as George Eliot, reeling from the death of God, took solace in the unfathomable intricacies of the universe. Gray condemns secular humanism as the continuation of religion by other means, but his own faith in some vague, inexplicable enigma beyond the material is open to exactly the same charge.• Terry Eagleton’s Radical Sacrifice is published by Yale.

It was created by Swiss chocolatier Barry Callebaut - the world’s largest cocoa processor - which spent more than a decade unlocking and experimenting with the beans’ colours and flavours. The flavour is described by the company as “a tension between berry-fruitiness and luscious smoothness” but no extra colours or flavours are added to create the pinky hue, which instead comes from a powder extracted during the processing. It is not as sweet as milk chocolate, according to its creators, with a lighter flavour instead.Ruby chocolate – a fourth chocolate after traditional dark, milk and white – has been attracting huge interest from chocolate connoisseurs throughout the world since it was first revealed in September last year. It is claimed to be the first new natural colour for chocolate since Nestlé unveiled white chocolate more than 80 years ago.The new KitKat was introduced earlier this year in Japan and Korea, where consumers are no strangers to unusual variations of the popular confectionery. In Japan the varieties on sale at any given time stretch to dozens, including purple sweet potato, edamame bean and wasabi. In the UK it will go on sale in branches of Tesco on 16 April. “We know that a new type of KitKat is a really big deal and we are very excited to be able to offer a different type of chocolate for fans to try” said Alex Gonnella, marketing director for Nestlé’s UK confectionery business. “Ruby chocolate is a big innovation in confectionery and we are very proud that KitKat is the first major brand in the UK to feature this exciting new chocolate.”Pablo Perversi, chief innovation, quality and sustainability officer at Barry Callebaut, said: “I am very pleased to see the result of our partnership with Nestlé – the iconic four-finger KitKat made with our ruby chocolate. Consumers across the world will be intrigued by the unique taste of this crispy delight.”Following the UK launch, the product will go on sale across Europe and the US.

An average of 11 stores a day opened, while 16 a day closed. The data does not include independent shops.Fashion and footwear stores were the hardest hit in 2017, according to LDC, as shoppers’ freedom to spend on non-essentials was diminished by rising food price inflation, partly fuelled by the fall in the value of the pound after the vote for Brexit in 2016.However, there was a net rise in the number of beauty stores in 2017, while cafes, coffee shops, ice-cream parlours and bookstores also increased in number, according to the LDC data.The pace of closures increased substantially in the second half of last year, reflecting the switch to online shopping, combined with rising staff and business rates costs. Shoppers reined in spending, with consumer confidence reaching a four-year low in December. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: “2017 was tough for the British retail industry, particularly the second half of the year. We saw volatility from month to month and across different sectors as wage growth failed to keep up with inflation, forcing many shoppers to think more carefully about their spending habits.”The problems have continued into the first quarter of 2018, which PwC said was the toughest first quarter since the last recession in 2009-10. Big names including Toys R Us and Bargain Booze owner Conviviality have fallen into administration, while New Look is closing dozens of stores in a major restructure. Mothercare, Carpetright and Homebase are all considering closing dozens of stores. On Tuesday, lingerie brand Ultimo confirmed that it is to be wound up, blaming “more cautious consumer spending”.Shoe chains Brantano and Jones Bootmaker called in administrators last year, resulting in the closure of about 170 stores in total, while discount fashion chain Store Twenty One went into liquidation, closing 125 outlets. Jaeger and Style Group, which includes Jacques Vert and Windsmoor, also closed some shops despite being rescued from administration.Some bigger chains including Clarks, Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Debenhams have closed a handful of stores as shoppers increasingly opt to browse and buy clothing via their smartphone or laptop.Glen Took, consumer insight director at Kantar, said clothing and footwear retailers’ troubles reflected a change in culture towards enjoying experiences rather than buying products. “People are trying to make the most of their time doing something with family or friends and then they go shopping on a Sunday evening on the internet. If you look at social media culture, if you are going to have an amazing time doing something you can put on Instagram, what is going to give? It could be you are going to wear the same shoes you wore last week.”The Works discount bookshop chain drove the growth in bookstores, while WH Smith has been adding new specialist book sites as readers return to physical books while sales of ebooks have slowed.But the rise of online services spurred a dramatic drop in the number of banks, travel agents and estate agents on British high streets last year. Travel agency chains were hit by the highest number of net closures - 326 - while 201 banks, including more than 60 HSBC branches, shut their doors. With the ability to access goods and services quickly from home, families have less reason to hit the high street and are more likely to buy items only when they need them rather than picking up something on impulse or planning ahead. High street expert Mary Portas said the government could help by cutting business rates, but retailers needed to adapt or die. “We are going through a massive transition. Businesses that are going down are sometimes too big to be nimble and responsive and sometimes they are just mediocre and they haven’t invested in what consumers want. It is about being innovative and creative.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b7f1cd8722fa481a0ea964028ce05b555e7e1b4/0_49_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=caf9f3e38521e8879d6370108c8595c7 2600w","title":"australia all ages music venues brisbane rock","story":"With Australia’s live music scene struggling to survive, Brisbane’s promoters are using open and alcohol-free gigs to attract younger music lovers. Will it work?It’s Good Friday in Brisbane and most of the city is dead quiet, with pubs and clubs not opening until midnight due to Easter trading laws. In the inner suburb of West End, however, something very noisy is stirring.On a makeshift stage in a large room, a three-piece band called Hexmere is playing a raucous, raw brand of grindcore punk to a small crowd. There’s another gig planned for the following night, with many more people expected.These all-ages shows are being sporadically staged by the Outer Space art collective, which won the Brisbane city council’s tender to operate this 300-capacity venue for two years, rent-free. The space needs work. But it represents an experiment, a gamble and a new hope for the city’s youth culture.The fact that the city council chose to make the space available is important. Despite a rich history, live music in Brisbane, as in so many other cities around the world, struggles to survive against the pressures of gentrification, regulation and competition.The music industry’s inextricable links to alcohol and bars has left a dearth of venues accessible to under-18s, raising concerns about how the complex ecosystem that sustains a vibrant local music scene – comprising everything from record shops to independent labels to public radio – will reproduce itself without engaging audiences from a young age.Live from Outer Space is an attempt to buck that trend in Brisbane. Coordinator Alex Campbell watches Hexmere as sound technician Hannah buzzes around the room, checking noise levels and sonic balance. Campbell says she has encouraged women and non-binary people to get involved in the male-dominated space of sound engineering especially.In the crowd tonight are the three members of the Goon Sax, back home in Brisbane after seven months in Berlin. Their 19-year-old frontman, Louis Forster, is the son of the Go-Betweens’ Robert – less than half a mile from the venue, the Go Between Bridge s the Brisbane river. But surfing the city’s next wave hasn’t been easy, even for a band with such pedigree.While the Goon Sax’s members were under 18, the venues they played required them to be accompanied by a parent and to leave immediately after their set, while their friends were unable to attend.Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities. The nation of nearly 25 million has one of the fastest-rising populations of all OECD countries, overwhelmingly focused on its biggest cities: Sydney and Melbourne. But with car dependence, urban sprawl and unaffordable housing threatening their famed liveability, are they ready for the challenge? Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live.“It’s cool something like this has opened up,” says Forster. “I know my sister’s psyched about it – she’s 16 and she’s coming tomorrow night. I was pretty frustrated by it when I was a kid growing up. I remember going to soundchecks and standing outside venues and listening, stuff like that.”Brisbane takes some pride in its musical past – another international export, the Saints, are the subject of a mural celebrating their achievements on the other side of the river, and the band’s guitarist Ed Kuepper has a local park named after him. But the council’s decision to back Outer Space represents a recognition of the need to invest in the city’s cultural future.“There’s all these young kids who don’t have any places to go,” says Louis Whelan, who is director of Outer Space’s all-ages live-music programme and also plays in his own band, the Mouldy Lovers. “Most events are really alcohol-focused. Playing somewhere where people are just going to get wasted, it’s not the same thing as playing where people want to see music.“If there’s a whole new generation of people who are much more engaged with the arts and music, then when they get out and they have disposable incomes, they’re going to go to galleries, to venues, to buy local bands’ music and start their own labels. I think there’s a lot of value in it.”It’s not just kids who are struggling to find places to play. In Sydney – once a live-music Mecca to rival London or New York – bands now struggle to play at all, with venues under pressure from soaring real estate prices, noise complaints, punitive regulations and a cosy relationship between government and developers. The city’s longest-serving live venue, The Basement – which, over 45 years, has hosted artists from Dizzy Gillespie to Prince – closed last week, though its owners are hopeful of finding other premises.The situation has become so difficult that the state of New South Wales is now holding a parliamentary inquiry. Dave Faulkner, singer and songwriter of enduring Australian garage band the Hoodoo Gurus, told the inquiry that live music was treated like the sex industry, “as something to be shunned. We employ so many people, we generate incredible amounts of money throughout the economy – and yet we’re treated so badly.”Faced with similar issues, music scenes around the world have been forced underground, into house parties or often illegal warehouse gigs, accessible only to those in the know. “It starts to get a bit worrying when kids are in those scenes,” says Emily Collins, managing director of the government-funded advocacy body MusicNSW. “We’d much rather them be in venues where we can make sure it’s safe and they can learn to love music in a safe and supporting environment. At warehouse parties there are no security guards, there’s no regulation, no one monitoring alcohol consumption. And they’re more focused on over-18 activities anyway – not that anyone is checking ID.”All-ages shows have a twofold benefit, says Collins: they foster a self-sustaining community of audiences and performers that in turn helps nurture a creative city. The sticking point, particularly in Australia, is breaking the nexus between music and alcohol.Venues, already under severe financial duress, are reluctant to put on events where no money is coming over the bar and the regulatory environment is forbidding. “There are multiple bodies that need to be satisfied, so there is considerable complexity, high costs and red tape in running a compliant venue,” says Julian Knowles, chair of MusicNSW and a professor of music at Macquarie University.“There is no ‘agent of change’ law in New South Wales that puts the responsibility on developers to soundproof new developments near music venues. If new residents make noise complaints, the venue is held accountable and must meet acoustic treatment costs, so it’s very risky for venue operators. At best, it erodes business confidence and at worst it can shut down venues entirely.”The introduction of controversial lockout laws in 2014, imposing curfews on venues in a bid to curb alcohol-related violence more associated with nightclubs than live music events, have been relaxed to some degree, but otherwise only worsened the operating environment.Against this backdrop, MusicNSW offers funding to promoters and venues to stage all-ages shows, but Collins says applications are few. “People say it’s too hard as a venue – $15,000 won’t cut it.”Often bands are paid literally out of beer takings. “They’re basically saying: the more heavy drinkers attend your gig, the better you’ll get paid,” says Ray Ahn, bass player of another longstanding punk band, the Hard-Ons. “With that kind of a working model, it’s harder to organise all-ages shows. Where’s the money going to come from?”The parliamentary inquiry underlines what a cautionary tale Sydney has become. Dave Faulkner said the city’s culture was dying. “When people come to Sydney they don’t just come to see the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, they also go to have a night out and to see music – it’s what I do when I go to London or New York. But Sydney has been doing everything it can to destroy those places of entertainment and turn them into apartment buildings.”In the late 70s and early 80s, hundreds of pubs and clubs throughout the city and suburbs kept artists busy, with major Australian bands such as Midnight Oil honing their live skills by playing upwards of 200 shows a year.From the late 80s to the early 90s, Ahn says, the Hard-Ons would often play an all-ages show in the afternoon and another for over-18s in the evening. Now, they might have played one all-ages show in Australia in the last 10 years. When the band tour Europe or Japan, though, it’s a different story.“A lot of the shows we do in Europe are in purpose-built halls that have the bar on the outside,” Ahn says. “Inside, there is no bar – it’s like a flat-ceilinged room with a massive PA and volunteers running around everywhere. So where are they getting the money from? They’re getting it from the city council.”The environment in Germany was more easygoing, says Louis Forster, even when he was younger. “I spent a lot of time there growing up, and I could always get into venues – it was never a problem. Parents would bring their kids to shows, which was really fantastic.”In Australia, Melbourne actively promotes itself as the live-music capital, and with good reason. A Deloitte study in 2011 valued the sector’s economic contribution at over half a billion dollars, with small venues providing the bulk of revenue and employment. Though many venues have closed in recent years, the value of investing in the live-music sector at grassroots level has long been recognised.The Push, a not-for-profit youth music organisation, has been operating in Victoria since 1986, providing a launch platform for countless bands. As well as all-ages shows, it puts on mentoring programmes and skills workshops.Shaad D’Souza, a music journalist who used to coordinate all-ages events for the organisation, notes that it is a cultural investment as well as a financial one. “Lots of kids, when they grow up they’ll only really go to big festivals or big arena shows because that’s all they’ve had access to,” he says. “Whereas if you’re investing in all-ages shows, they develop a relationship with venues, they develop a relationship with artists, and then they know: ‘I want to support my local scene.’ They want to go to smaller venues they don’t just want to go to arena shows or festivals.”At the end of the night, Alex Campbell’s band, Bad Bangers, will launch their EP. The band are in their 20s now. “But that’s kind of why we started this – because there weren’t many all-ages spaces when we were younger.”In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

In 1984, the prominent Sydney architect Neville Gruzman suggested the city should be bulldozed into the surf.Today, the Gold Coast seems to be attempting that reinvention itself. It is Australia’s fastest growing city and larger than three of its state capitals (Canberra, Hobart and Darwin), with the 2018 Commonwealth Games doubtless accelerating a maturation already under way.Every month or so there’s a new hip place to be seen, an old high rise disappears and a shiny new one soars. Every week some new claim is made for the ultimate in gastronomic happiness.Do these ventures live up to the hype? Sometimes. But it hardly matters. The Gold Coast is a city built on hype, on rise and fall. As a longtime resident, I’ve experienced several waves of self-proclaimed urban renaissance and learned that, while the spin exists largely to generate the sale of sky homes, each growth phase possesses a grain of truth.The Gold Coast wants to grow up. But is that possible when the rest of the country’s estimations of it are so rigid?Unlike many major Australian cities, the Gold Coast does not retain much evidence of a colonial urban sensibility, in part because of rampant redevelopment and erasure, but largely because it never really got started.The urban vision was always more closely linked to a 20th-century American aesthetic. The influence of the strip cities of Miami, Los Angeles and particularly Las Vegas are in evidence as well as, more recently, nods to the 21st-century architectural ambition of Dubai and Shanghai. While each of these cities have marked differences they all share a postwar history of urban expansion and proliferation.All have grown at phenomenal rates, new frontier cities that owe less to major port affiliations or centrifugal notions of planning than they do to strip formations, late capitalism and experimental development. The big-ticket architecture says so.The $1bn luxury Jewel project currently under development epitomises this push for opulent new millennium design. An example of continuing high-end investment in architectural innovation, the development is a six-star three-tower structure modelled on shards of smoky quartz crystals found on a mountain in the region. The interpretation is refreshingly abstract compared with the ubiquitous “palm tree, primary colour” resort styling the Gold Coast has leaned so much on in the past.Across many sectors, the city is shrugging off the declarative localism it has played to in exchange for a more sophisticated spin on where it sits in the world. It will be interesting to note how the international spotlight will burn. In 2016, international tourism figures peaked at one million. Tourists from Asia make up the majority of those, as they have for decades. People from Singapore get the Gold Coast, as do people people from Hong Kong and Dubai – they are all cities that share a new frontier urban aesthetic.The real opposition to the Gold Coast’s ambition is national. Australians often experience the city in hyperactive mode, arriving to soak up the sun and get away with what they’re less likely to at home raging down streets like no one lives here, hiring mopeds and tuk tuks blasting Justin Bieber or ACDC, high on party drugs or table-sized martinis. Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities. The nation of nearly 25 million has one of the fastest-rising populations of all OECD countries, overwhelmingly focused on its biggest cities: Sydney and Melbourne. But with car dependence, urban sprawl and unaffordable housing threatening their famed liveability, are they ready for the challenge? Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live.They may have visited in a pack of mates at the annual Schoolies festival – a Spring Break equivalent that erupted in the 1970s and still attracts tens of thousands of school leavers. Or they may have vibrant memories of flying through the hyperreal universes of the Dreamworld, Movieworld and Seaworld theme parks as kids. It’s these off-kilter experiences – the combination of bright lights, sunburnt skin and cringey recollections – twinned with the consistent media overplay that continue to define national opinions of a city locals affectionately refer to as “the Goldie”.It is not unusual for major cities to have underworlds: corrupt power centres and schlocky, sometimes violent nightclub strips. It’s just that the depiction of such things erupting on Australia’s Gold Coast makes great trash TV. Stock footage proliferates of schoolies vomiting in bins, bikies brawling in restaurants, meter maids in gold bikinis and bare-knuckle violence – but these things exist as a fraction of a much larger whole.The burgeoning arts scene is emblematic of the city’s evolution. Twenty years ago, arts visibility, policy and recognition barely existed, and certainly not at levels that could match commercial imperatives. Today, the Gold Coast can hold its own. Under the directives of the Culture Strategy 2023, the city council has invested $7m in the development of an arts and cultural programme for Festival 2018, linked to the Commonwealth Games, while a $365m cultural precinct funded by all levels of government will be launched in stages. Yet the attitude of the rest of Australia towards the city, even though it is now one of the top five tourist destinations nationally, seems to be: “We want you to stay in your box.” Evidence of the Gold Coast’s continuing appeal as a preferred place to holiday and live goes largely unacknowledged.In part, this paradox is related to class. Australia prides itself on being an egalitarian society, but it can be highly parochial and territorial. The rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne is legendary neither would ever consider the Gold Coast as worthy of debate.The city’s location in Queensland doesn’t help. From 1968 to 1987, the state was under the corrupt rule of the disgraced premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, known as the “hillbilly dictator”, who fostered the creation of a police state and opposed homosexuality, abortion, demonstrations against anti-apartheid and even the 40-hour work week. Perceptions of Queenslanders have been affected ever since.This is no different from the idea that Parisians are all rude or New Yorkers unfriendly. The Gold Coast is more dynamic than its enduring mythologies suggest. It does not so much resemble an overgrown Porpoise Spit, the mythical town made famous by the film Muriel’s Wedding: an acrylic land of hoop earrings, dumb surfers and undone housewives burning down backyards.Cities have moods and boroughs, and things only locals know. They are at their best when they surprise when you sink in to the city and relate to it on its own terms. The Gold Coast has been allowed to be trashy, glitzy and even obscene, as long as it doesn’t gatecrash the VIP party – one smoky quartz slipper already dangerously close to the rope. In any case, this won’t be the city’s last renaissance.In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

A case in point, as has become sharply evident this week, is the much-vaunted “deconfliction” arrangement between Russia and Israel after the former entered the war in Syria on the side of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.Negotiated between Vladimir Putin and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, it was held up at first as evidence of the latter’s diplomatic skills – an arrangement that allowed Israel a free hand against weapons transfers from Iran to Hezbollah and maintained Israeli deterrence on its northern border.Over seven years, the civil war has dragged in multiple foreign nations, turning what started as a pro-democracy uprising into a quagmire of overlapping conflicts.Global powerhouses including Iran, Israel, Russia, Turkey, and the United States have all, to different extents, engaged their militaries in the conflict. At the same time, they have supported warring factions on the ground, including Iran-allied Hezbollah, Kurdish militia, and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces alliance. Islamic State and al-Qaida are also present.If that arrangement has for long looked very shaky, the reaction of Russia and Iran to Israeli strikes this week on an airbase in Syria, killing seven Iranian advisers, has brutally exposed the assumptions that underlie it, not least Moscow’s tolerance for Israel’s assumption of its freedom of action.The reality is that Israel – and Netanyahu in particular – has badly misread the trajectory of Russia’s re-engagement in the Middle East, which has created in the very kindest interpretation the context for Iran’s projection of its influence ever further west and ever closer to Israel’s borders.Why all this matters in the current febrile context following the latest alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria, is that Israel’s misjudgments sit at one corner of a dangerous matrix of unpredictability, perhaps unseen – as James Hohmann argued in the Washington Post – since the secretary of state Dean Acheson suggested in 1950 that Korea was outside the core defence perimeter of the US.On the American side that uncertainty around intentions has seen Donald Trump flip-flop so dramatically that in a handful of days he has somersaulted from suggesting first that his country was rushing for the exit on Syria to a situation where military strikes seem likely.In Israel, a wounded Netanyahu – who has built an entire political career on promising to be a bulwark against Iran – is now being confronted with his rhetoric and the consequence of his actions, not least his bloody public pricking of Iran in a way that Tehran may now find hard to discount.In the final corner there is Putin, whose calculations are opaque because that is his intention – not least over his ambitions and red lines.The result is a highly combustible situation in which no party to the conflict – direct or otherwise – can be certain of the assumptions that the others are operating under.All of which has created what Stephen Pinker describes in his illuminating book on violence and war, The Better Angels of Our Nature, as a classic “security” or “Hobbesian” dilemma, a situation where actions by a state ostensibly to heighten their security can prompt other states to act pre-emptively, risking a fugue of escalation. As more violence seems likely, what is also troubling is that the key mechanism for avoiding such an escalation – the UN security council – seems profoundly weakened by the further weaponisation of the US and Russian vetoes under both Trump and Putin.History teaches us that wars – from the first world war to Korea, the six-day war and the Falklands – are often fuelled by failures of messaging and interpretation.Looking around the Middle East today never has that felt more true. And never have wise heads been in such short supply.• Peter Beaumont is a Guardian reporter and former Jerusalem correspondent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ab5e02b4913589399324d8bbe8070c3db914551/0_0_3488_2093/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7c0b7972ac651ba2892b1b80f065f69d 1240w","title":"the guardian view on shoe box britain space is good for us lets have some","story":"So it is bizarre that the UK is one of the few western European nations to have no mandatory minimum space standards for housing. Little wonder that other nations have bigger homes while the UK gets shoe boxes. Ministers did introduce voluntary space standards for new homes in 2015, but as these could be ignored they only gave the appearance of solidity to pure wind. When this ruse was called out in 2016, the government said it would review how these were operating. Nothing has appeared. Part of this is to do with a rightwing legacy: Margaret Thatcher got rid of rules that set a reasonable internal size for public housing. Reintroducing legal standards in the interests of society is the right thing to do. It would also be a repudiation of a Thatcherite legacy, and is at odds with the direction of travel in housing.Houses are needed and the reasons are largely to do with social justice, inequality and the distribution of political power. There must be an acknowledgment of the psychological comforts that domesticity affords. Past rules would need to be updated – homes must no longer find space for dining tables and upright pianos but be designed for the activities and furniture that are typical today. The Grenfell Tower tragedy provided a new background for politicians to think about housing. For too long politicians have cultivated voters reliant on house prices remaining high, and rising. The policies that have allowed this have had a damaging impact on a growing proportion of the population. So far Theresa May’s government has exaggerated how far it is prepared to intervene on the side of this section of society. Setting mandatory standards for house sizes is one test of whether this rhetoric will yield to reality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1492e0e13c7dc32017a66fbc6e33bdd8e853eb6/628_1529_2880_1728/master/2880.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dc75e04c19daf1588f4fbce39f5ae99f 1240w","title":"tiny violins moaning pretty being beautiful blessing curse samantha brick","story":"Being beautiful mainly seems a blessing. But it can be a curse – and the main problem is that you are just not allowed to complain about itIt’s tough being beautiful. Other women, women who are not so genetically blessed, despise you, you see. They worry you will steal their husband. They get together with their average-looking friends and say nasty things behind your inordinately elegant back. They think that, just because you have flawless skin, you don’t have feelings. But you do have feelings: tragically, the world can’t look past your cut-glass cheekbones and understand that.If you have ever wondered What It’s Like to Go Through Life As a Really Beautiful Woman, this is about the sum of it, apparently. At least, according to an article published last week on New York magazine’s lifestyle website, the Cut. In it, an anonymous woman in her late 50s explains that being attractive opened a lot of doors for her in life, but also made women hate her. I’m fairly sure the beautiful-but-damned subject of the article wasn’t Samantha Brick, but it is very much reminiscent of her infamous 2012 magnum opus in the Daily Mail, There are Downsides to Looking This Pretty: Why Women Hate Me for Being Beautiful. And, like Brick’s much-laughed-at lament, it was immediately and mercilessly mocked on social media.Rightly so. The article reads like a parody, parroting tiresome tropes about jealous, catty women. Yet it’s a shame the response to the piece descended so swiftly into jeers. There is an interesting and important conversation to be had about what it’s like to go through life as a really beautiful woman – or a very handsome man. Looks aren’t everything, but count for a lot. We might not like to admit it, but we are all prone to treating people differently according to their appearance. Studies show that even babies prefer looking at more attractive faces. But while we are all affected by beauty biases, I’m not sure we are often prompted to examine and curb them – and they have real repercussions.But while beauty mainly seems to be a blessing, it can also be a curse. Being considered attractive works against you if you are a woman applying for a traditionally “masculine” job, for example. In 2015, a study from University College London’s School of Management found that while handsome men are seen as more competent, this makes them less likely to be hired in competitive workplaces because they are perceived as a threat. Funny, isn’t it? Despite there being clear evidence that men can be threatened by other men’s looks, they are rarely accused of same-sex jealousy in the way women are. It is almost as if society goes out of its way to pit women against each other.Ultimately, it seems that the main problem with being attractive is that people are not allowed to complain about it. As articles like the one in the Cut make clear, nothing brings out the sarcastic tiny violins faster than someone moaning about the pitfalls of aesthetic perfection. While that may be understandable, I think it is also worth understanding that society sometimes penalises prettiness. Let’s not be so quick to hate on people just because they write op-eds about being beautiful.It’s a big week for Mark Zuckerberg, who is appearing in front of Congress to apologise for inadvertently undermining democracy. Facebook reportedly prepared for this personal responsibility (PR) exercise by bringing in an army of experts to give its CEO a “crash course” in charm – a quality the ZuckBot is not known for.What does this charm curriculum comprise? If I happened to control a complex system of mass surveillance or was as good at hacking as certain Tory MPs, I would be able to tell you in detail. Sadly, this is not the case. So, I can only speculate that preparations kicked off with careful scrutiny of the personal data of all the politicians Zuck will be meeting. People like it when you ask them about themselves, Mark! Why not try asking that congressman – you know, the one who has been having a secret affair for the past three months – how he liked the new carbonara recipe he tried the other day?Facebook being Facebook, I imagine some fancy tech was involved in updating MZ’s interpersonal operating system. An empathy algorithm, perhaps, devised to recommend meaningful semantic structures that build a sense of genuine community. Or maybe there is proprietary communication code that prompts Zuckerberg to nod and say “yes” at regular intervals to make it seem as if he is actually listening and not just counting the minutes until he can escape from having to interact with mere mortals.Or maybe charm training was a little more analogue than that. Perhaps Zuckerberg was just advised to take off that unflattering T-shirt and wear a suit. Perhaps he was told to say the word “sorry” a statistically significant number of times. After all, if you repeat any old nonsense long enough, people will believe it. Facebook knows that better than just about anyone.One day you tweet a question about whether snakes fart, the next you’ve landed a book deal about animal flatulence. Well, Dani Rabaiotti knows how it is, anyway. Last year, the environmental scientist sent a tweet that turned into a viral hashtag (#doesitfart) that turned into a book called Does It Fart: the Definitive Field Guide to Animal Flatulence. This includes must-know information such as the fact that sloths don’t break wind. Meanwhile, seal farts smell like fish, while herrings use their liberated gas to communicate with each other, much like small children. The book only came out in the US last week, but it was released in Britain last year. I guess the UK is inordinately receptive to hot air."},{"url":null,"title":"mark zuckerbergs facebook hearing sham","story":"Now that the initial show trial is done, we need the real dealOn Tuesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was on the hot seat. Cameras surrounded him. The energy in the room – and on Twitter – was electric. At last, the reluctant CEO is made to answer some questions!Except it failed. It was designed to fail. It was a show designed to get Zuckerberg off the hook after only a few hours in Washington DC. It was a show that gave the pretense of a hearing without a real hearing. It was designed to deflect and confuse.Every senator was given less than five minutes for questions. That meant that there was no room for follow-ups, no chance for big discoveries and many frustratingly half-developed ideas. Compare that to Bill Gates’ hearing on Microsoft, where he faced lawyers and staff for several days, or the Kefauver hearings, which were over a year. By design, you can’t do a hearing of this magnitude in a day. The worst moments of the hearing for us, as citizens, were when senators asked if Zuckerberg would support legislation that would regulate Facebook. I don’t care whether Zuckerberg supports Honest Ads, or privacy laws, or GDPR. By asking him if he would support legislation, the senators elevated him to a kind of co-equal philosopher King whose view on Facebook regulation carried special weight. It shouldn’t.Facebook is a known behemoth corporate monopoly. It has exposed at least 87 million people’s data, enabled foreign propaganda, and perpetuated discrimination. We shouldn’t be begging for Facebook’s endorsement of laws, or for Mark Zuckerberg’s promises of self-regulation. We should treat him as a danger to democracy, and demand our senators get a real hearing.The best senators understood this was a show, and used it as such. “Your user agreement sucks,” said Senator John Kennedy. “Are you a monopoly?” asked Senator Lindsey Graham (Zuckerberg comicly responded that he didn’t “feel” like it.) Senator Richard Blumenthal said we needed laws, not promises or apologies.Because every senator was limited to under five minutes, Zuckerberg always tried to run the clock by talking about mission, or philosophy, or what he believed in. There were some good questions, but there was little chance for follow up. You could almost see him, well-trained to count the minutes, playing for time when things got a little hot. Senators Hironi and Booker, for instance, both pointed out the damning reporting by Julia Angwin at ProProblica, which showed that employers and landlords were using Facebook for discriminatory ads. Zuckerberg defended the company by saying they were hard to flag, and that they depend on community flagging to stop them. The tools Facebook provides make discrimination easy. Facebook has monopoly profit margins, so it can easily provide real staffing to protect against discrimination, if it wanted to. It doesn’t want to. Hironi and Booker’s could have shown that, but, like the rest of the senators, they each had only a few minutes for a line of questioning. Zuckerberg replied with vague answers about how their comments were “important” or “interesting” or “an important conversation to have.”Some of the hearing seemed designed to figure out whether Zuckerberg is a good or bad man, or whether he has a good or bad – or bizarre – political philosophy. Zuckerberg strikes me as reliably self-serving. That doesn’t make him that interesting as the CEO of a corporate monopoly it makes him a run-of-the-mill robber baron. Asking Zuckerberg philosophical questions, like how he thinks we should deal with questions of hate speech, treat him as a thought leader, a reasonable philosopher king. Accepting his failures to catch discriminatory housing ads, for instance, treats him as a good-hearted actor with limited resources, instead of someone who is making monopoly margins and billions in profits.In my view, we need to break up Facebook from Instagram and the other potential competitors that Facebook bought up. We need to – at a minimum – move towards opt-in, we need to hold Facebook responsible for enabling discrimination, and we need to require interoperability.But that’s not enough. There is so much we don’t know about Facebook. We know we have a corporate monopoly that has repeated serious violations that are threatening our democracy. We don’t know how their algorithm treats news organizations or content producers, how Facebook uses its own information about Facebook users or how tracking across platforms works, to just give a few examples. Now that the initial show trial is done, we need the real deal, one where no senator gets cut off after a few minutes. The real hearing would allow for unlimited questions from each of our senators, who represent millions of people. If it takes two months of sitting in Washington DC, let it take two months. This is our democracy.

Its buried are not men and women, but the carcasses of 13 nuclear submarines. Some have been dead for decades, such as the HMS Conqueror, which sank the Belgrano 36 years ago. Nine still have nuclear fuel rods, and there have been repeated leaks of radioactive waste. The Ministry of Defence claims all are safe. Then again, it sometimes doesn’t even disclose breaches until months later, when MPs and journalists have had to winch out the truth.All this runs true to local history. For nigh-on five decades, Devonport had its own Berlin Wall, with 50 acres of land walled up by the military. Complete with barbed wire running around the top, it was loathed by locals. It was only toppled in 2007. “The navy, the army, the air force: they come in, they do what they want, and take away the bits of the city they want for themselves,” says councillor Chris Penberthy, who grew up near the dockyard.“People do things to Plymouth,” he says. “Plymouth hasn’t often been allowed to do things for itself.” He is referring to the blitz, followed by the imposition of an Abercrombie city plan and the throwing up of shoddy housing. He also means the way in which well-meaning policy experts will today pitch up with some cash and pilot their brainwaves in Devonport and the impoverished west of the city. They come with a grand scheme to deal with household budgeting or child malnutrition and stay for a few months until the money runs out. Then they hurry off. A 60s baby, Penberthy grew up to the smell of Farley’s Rusks baking nearby. It joined Clarks’ shoes on a long rollcall of big local businesses. This is the Plymouth that residents liken to a northern mill town or a Welsh mining village. Just like them, the industry left decades ago. Just like them, it voted for Brexit.Representing the ward next door to Devonport, Penberthy sees ingrained deprivation in one of the richest countries in human history. Primary schools hold “brushing clubs” to help children look after their teeth, and “for some of those kids, aged eight or nine, it’ll be the first time they use a toothbrush”. Ahead of next month’s local elections, women on doorsteps say, “I vote how my husband tells me.” Families ripped off by the benefits office and bilked of desperately-needed cash for their disabled children sigh, “They must be right – they are the government.”What lends this even greater piquancy is Plymouth’s naval history, still celebrated in the breakfast rooms of a hundred lodging houses, with their paintings of Francis Drake on a bowling green. Before the dockyard became a radioactive burial ground, it employed tens of thousands of men. Today that figure is about 2,500.Post-industrial, post-imperial, post-Suez, Plymouth is no ordinary city it is a place where the furs in which Britain wraps itself are revealed as so many rags. Which makes what it does instead important not just locally but nationally. What it is doing is one of the most intriguing experiments I have seen in any British city. However far from perfect, it shows what can happen when a council tries to shape how business behaves in its backyard. It is what a city doing things for itself looks like. And it starts neither in the council chamber nor the city centre, but in a knackered hall in Devonport. Dotted across Devonport are the grand Regency buildings that remind visitors of its vast previous wealth and pre-1914 status as an independent town. Most imposing of all is the Guildhall, with its massive Doric pillars. By the mid-2000s, it had lain empty for years, being far too large for the now-shrunken local economy. Then, to councillors’ relief, along came a regional group called the Real Ideas Organisation (Rio).“The conversation began, ‘Do you think it needs to be a community centre, a business centre or an arts centre?’” recalls Rio chief executive Lyndsey Hall. “By the end, it was, ‘We don’t care what you do – just take it away.’” With a £1.75m grant, Hall did just that. Today, it’s not just a centre for community or business or arts: it’s all three – and more. “No one’s going to get rich out of running a building like this,” says Hall’s colleague Ed Whitelaw. “Why would any private company want to take it on?”But Hall and Whitelaw don’t run a standard business. Theirs is a social enterprise, a company that uses its profits and assets for public good. Rio derives an income from the Guildhall, but it doesn’t sweat the building for every last penny.To wander around the Guildhall is to see that ethos in action: the main hall with its stained-glass windows has just been vacated by a team of cheerleaders, and is let out for free to community groups. Other social enterprises rent office space and use the basement jail cells as meeting rooms. In the corner is a cafe and bakery.When the council met Rio in the late 2000s, social enterprises were still a novelty. Hall had been inspired by a visit to Toronto and seeing everything from supermarket chains to the giant Harbourfront arts centre operating as community businesses. But in the UK, social enterprises, or community interest companies, were only legally recognised in 2005. A product of fag-end Blairism, they came bearing that ideology’s virtues and vices: a desire to tackle age-old social problems in new ways and a bewildered wonderment at the magic that could somehow be worked by entrepreneurs. That haze hangs over the 2005 act, which establishes a watchdog for the new businesses – but says its “power should be exercised only to the extent necessary to maintain confidence in community interest companies”. As for how exactly communities were to be served by these companies – well, that was usually left for the companies themselves to define. Whether returning £10m or 10p to society – that’s up to them. “Some social enterprises we go, ‘brilliant, fabulous’,” says Rio’s Hall. “Other things named as social enterprises we go, ‘ugh’.”Yet consider the possibilities that a new form of entrepreneurship offers Plymouth, which faces the same huge challenge as numberless towns and cities across Britain and the west: how to get capital and power to stay local. One answer adopted by Chris Penberthy and the other Labour politicians voted in to lead the council in 2012 was to grow a different kind of business. The next year, Plymouth raced Bristol to become the first social enterprise city in the UK.“How do we grow our economy and grow ourselves a future? By finding companies who will do more than corporate social responsibility,” says Penberthy, who was put in charge of growing social enterprise in the city, a post then unknown to local government.“There was a lot of banging desks and ‘Do it now!’” recalls Alistair Macpherson, who worked at the council for years. In another municipal rarity, Penberthy set up a public fund to kickstart new social enterprises. More than largesse or political vision, this was a way for a local authority with dwindling budgets to fill in the gaps that big business wouldn’t touch.Those gaps are not just the dead buildings brought back to life by Rio, which is now at work on a £7m project to turn Devonport’s abandoned market hall into a high-tech centre for virtual reality. They’re also the solar farm that Macpherson built as head of Plymouth Energy Community on contaminated land next door to a bomb dump. And they’re in the city centre’s abandoned shops, such as the one now occupied by Moments Cafe which, as well as selling mugs of tea and ham omelettes, helps dementia sufferers and their carers. Run by nurse Kate Smith, the cafe’s staff has been trained to look out for memory problems or distress among customers.What drew Luke into the cafe was a sign reading “Memory Matters”. It was like a personal message. Last July, surgeons had removed a brain tumour by cutting out part of a lobe, and now he could no longer remember basic things, whether afternoon plans or people’s names. At the till he didn’t ask for a coffee: “I just wanted a number. A number for me to ring to speak about my memory.”Instead, Kate took him upstairs for a quiet chat – then it all came out. How the tumour meant he’d lost his building business and split from the mother of his four-year-old girl. How his head still hurt so much, despite all the heavy-duty meds. The attempts to kill himself. How the council had stuck him in a house-share with two other men, both threatening to beat him up. How he’d run away, with nowhere else to go. “I just bawled my eyes out,” says Luke, and not because of how much trouble he was in. “It was the acceptance from Kate. She listened and understood.”“You can’t leave him,” Smith remembers thinking to herself. “He’ll die.” So she lobbied council officers, drafted in support from Luke’s doctors, and got him a diary. Flip it open and the pages teem with Smith’s neatly written reminders to visit the hospital, phone the bank. It was a week’s work, reckons Smith. “And the rest,” laughs Luke. It paid off: he is now in a Travelodge while the council sorts out a permanent home. An amazing story, but it leaves you wondering why a just-opened cafe is picking up the pieces dropped by the NHS and the council – and whether tears over coffee and long hours ringing around a civic centre can ever form an actual business model. At the same time, it’s impossible to imagine such stories coming out of the mammoth Costa just a few doors down.Plymouth now has more than 150 social enterprises employing over 7,000 workers earning a combined income of over £500m. For a city of 250,000 people, which only adopted social enterprise five years ago, that’s remarkable growth. Even more surprising is the politics. Political control over Plymouth council changes only slightly less frequently than the tide, yet the Tory administration that took over in 2016 has also encouraged and funded social enterprise. If, as looks likely, Labour returns to power next month, it is committed to doubling the city’s co-operative economy by 2025. With neither side threatening to pull the plug, national charities such as Esmee Fairbairn and Power To Change have the security they need to plough millions into the city’s sector.To see what social enterprise could look like, walk 10 minutes west from Moments Cafe to yet another local graveyard. Once heaving with pubs and clubs, Union Street is now silent and shut. Yet inside The Clipper, once open all hours, Hannah Sloggett and Wendy Hart have plans to open a covered market and turn the two flats above into affordable homes for single fathers who lack the bedrooms for their visiting kids.I’m reminded of a remark from Rio’s Hall. “There was that moment on television when you’d have Alan Sugar doing The Apprentice and getting people to behave as badly as possible. Then an hour afterwards, it’d be The Secret Millionaire – with all these tycoons making people cry by giving them money out of the goodness of their hearts. “And that’s – that’s just wrong!” Her head crashes into her palms. “Why are we creating a culture where it’s OK to make money behaving as badly as possible in order for people to give it away? That’s the culture we’ve got to change. I don’t care whether it’s called social enterprise, or anything else.”Aditya Chakrabortty is senior economics commentator for the GuardianAdditional reporting by Tom Wright"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19947f4bcd6c7418621a575f904a74fb77f13bde/0_109_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5b6a9384f83d3338a2c84817ddf1bc73 1240w","title":"viktor orban aleksandar vucic europe eu","story":"Two weeks before securing his latest electoral victory, Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister, travelled to the northern Serbian town of Subotica to meet his close friend, Aleksandar Vučić, the president of Serbia. Outside the region, few people\u0026nbsppay much attention to the bond\u0026nbspbetween these two men. Yet overlooking it would\u0026nbspbe hazardous. A\u0026nbspclose look at this duo can reveal a\u0026nbsplot about the nexus, in today’s Europe, between political engineering, nationalism, and how demagogues\u0026nbspcan thrive.Orbán and Vučić like each other because they have much in common, although one has made the EU an enemy while being part of it, while the other remains outside and aspires to join the club. They’re roughly of the same generation – one that entered politics in the turbulent era of the crumbling of the communist bloc.\u0026nbspThey both pander to nationalist sentiment, while toeing a fine line trying to preserve a functional relationship with important players within the EU – not least in Germany. And they are strongmen, with little interest indeed for checks and balances, liberal democracy or free media.But what is most fascinating – and also very telling of this particularly inchoate phase of European politics – is how Orbán and Vučić have managed to reinvent themselves spectacularly over the years. Their recipe for political survival and entrenchment lies in being perfect chameleons. They may infuse state-controlled television\u0026nbspwith constant ideology, but they hardly hold deep beliefs. Slogans are to them just a dress code that can be replaced, whenever convenient. They draw their strength from having a good nose for where the wind of\u0026nbsppublic opinion may blow – and how that can best be\u0026nbspexploited.Look at their careers. Orbán went from a late-1980s poster-child of democratic transition, to a trailblazer of Europe’s current national-populist nightmares. Vučić\u0026nbspwas once a staunch admirer of Serbia’s blood-drenched warlords in the 1990s Balkans, and at one point\u0026nbsphe joined Slobodan Milošević’s propaganda outfit as information minister. But by the 2010s, he had mutated into a seemingly\u0026nbspreasonable, eager pro-European. He had\u0026nbspwell\u0026nbspunderstood that dreams of a “Greater Serbia” had\u0026nbspcollapsed in national exhaustion\u0026nbspand defeat.Just as Orbán had detected that Brussels’ attractiveness was waning and decided it was time to cast his political net elsewhere, Vučić saw opportunity in self-transformation. He tacked on to a formally pro-European course, while Orbán opted to go the other way. The directions seem opposite, but the motivation is the same: to secure power. To be sure, Machiavellian manoeuvring is hardly rare currency in politics. Orbán and Vučić are just good\u0026nbspat it. But what matters here is the impact these shifts may have on Europe’s future – and whether there’s any possibility of further and perhaps altogether different shifts.These two men matter. Orbán’s Hungary is a magnet for the far right elsewhere on the continent. Serbia holds\u0026nbspthe key to the stability of the Balkans – a region that forms Europe’s strategic, vulnerable underbelly, and which Winston Churchill once described as “producing more history than it can consume”.In his book on Europe, Postwar, the historian Tony Judt played down the role of intellectual dissident groups in consolidating the 1989 revolutions of central Europe. He pointed, rather, to how “party functionaries and bureaucrats transformed themselves in a matter of months from nomenklatura yes-men to glib practitioners of pluralist party politics”.“Survival,” Judt wrote, “depended on recalibrating one’s allegiances.” “Market economy”, “democratisation” and “civil society” (or “Europe”, which encompassed all three) became the buzzwords. This is something Orbán himself experienced. In Yugoslavia, unlike in Hungary, things were different, because various populations were\u0026nbspso intermingled. Nationalism became Milošević’s\u0026nbspway of securing a hold on power. That’s a\u0026nbspstory Vučić became part of.So what about today? I happened to be\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspBelgrade shortly after Orbán and\u0026nbspVučić met in Subotica. The talk among politicians and civil society activists was all about passions flaring up\u0026nbspagain over Kosovo. Speculation ran high as to whether Vučić might choose to play on tensions in the region to recast himself as\u0026nbspa territory-grabbing ultra-nationalist. It could be his way of compensating for a loss of personal legitimacy if EU membership prospects don’t\u0026nbspmaterialise.Interestingly, there were also comments about Orbán’s interest in the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina (many of whom voted last Sunday, as dual citizens), where Subotica is located. The most pessimistic take I heard was this: that Orbán and Vučić will next engage in a game of revisiting borders, playing on Hungarian grievances about the 1920 treaty of Trianon and Serbian obsessions over Kosovo. For all the talk about democratic backsliding, ethnic and territorial questions\u0026nbspmay be the next looming crisis for Europe, as\u0026nbspfar-fetched as it may seem.The EU has only one tool to prevent such worst-case scenarios, which is to stick together and defend its principles by using its soft power of pressures and incitements. It needs to keep opportunist demagogues from giving way to their darkest temptations – and to act now. Remember, these are chameleons, they adapt to circumstance. Just as they changed their colour before, they might just change it again. The question is how."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e532467e517af16771a4e81b6a751338d2814e61/15_33_1468_881/master/1468.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=015a1f4d10cf7e2759e5bf6470b2d412 1240w","title":"manchester city pep guardiola champions league","story":"Pep Guardiola blamed decisions that went against Manchester City in both legs of the Champions League quarter-final as they were knocked out by Liverpool 5-1 on aggregate at the Etihad Stadium.“I said the ball came from Milner, he said: ‘Ah from Milner, the pass?’ ‘Yes from Milner and when it comes from Milner it is not offside.’“When you go to half-time at 2-0 against that side it is a bit different.

But it was McCarthy who grabbed the headlines after he was quizzed about the fans’ negative reaction to the 56th-minute substitution of debutant Barry Cotter.The former Republic of Ireland boss, who was already due to leave the club at the end of the season, retorted: “I won’t have to listen to that again, that’s my last game - I’m out of here.”His curt remark cut short his managerial career at Ipswich with four games to go in the Championship, with his relationship with some of the home fans reaching a low point.A spokesman for the club said he made the decision to leave the club along with his assistant Terry Connor on Sunday, following the 1-0 away defeat against Brentford, and plans are being made to put in a replacement until the end of the season.The Blues boss, who announced at the end of March he would be leaving his role in the summer, gave a three-minute press conference at the end of the game before revealing he was leaving.Reacting to boos when young defender Cotter was substituted in the second half, McCarthy said: “It was a disgraceful reaction, that, but I won’t have to listen to it again because that’s my last game. I’m out of here.”With that he banged the desk and departed, with the club then confirming the news on their website and Twitter feed.“I spoke with Marcus (Evans, owner) at the weekend and we agreed that it was in the best interests for me, the players and the club that I move on now,” McCarthy said in the website story.“I said I would see the season out but it’s been a new experience and it’s not one I have been enjoying to be honest.“I have continued to do my job to the best of my ability but there is something missing and I’m not comfortable with that.“I have had a great time here and worked with some great people and to all those who have given me wonderful support over the last five and a half years - and there are many - I want to put on record my personal thanks.“The players here can look forward to a new challenge with whoever comes in and I want to wish them, the staff and the club the best of fortunes.”McCarthy was linked with his hometown club Barnsley before the appointment of Jose Morais, who saw his side’s hopes of Championship survival take a hit with Tuesday’s result.Morais said: “It’s a defeat and there’s nothing more than to move on. All the games are big games and must-win games and we expected this game to be a must-win game. It was a difficult game, I don’t expect it to be easy, but I expect us to have the ability to win.“We created chances and we had the chances to lead the game and the confidence still exists in the team.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa40e8c5cee277d28e74e298cdc5a36fd4837961/31_0_4196_2517/master/4196.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=37b3a4fdbd8e418283c35e5924a126b8 1240w","title":"roma barcelona champions league quarter final match report","story":"The celebrations went on so long that for a while it seemed Roma’s incredulous supporters would never go home. The sea of red, white and yellow flags in the Curva Sud were lifted with pride, strangers were hugging each other and the anthems floating around the Roman air were still being belted out a good 20 minutes after the conclusion of one of the most remarkable comebacks in the history of the Champions League.It had been an extraordinary occasion, with one glance off the head of Kostas Manolas in the 82nd minute sparking scenes of pure elation among the locals, and nobody should criticise Roma for reacting as if they had just become the champions of Europe. They achieved something extraordinary, defying the odds on a wild night at the Stadio Olimpico by overhauling a 4-1 deficit to Barcelona from the first leg, and how the underdogs cherished reaching the semi-finals for the first time since 1984.Barcelona had nowhere to hide. Last year they stunned Paris Saint-Germain in the round of 16, advancing despite being thrashed 4-0 in the first leg, but the shoe was on their leaden foot this time. They were reduced to such a state of disarray that even Lionel Messi was booked for cynically hacking at Aleksandar Kolarov and Ernesto Valverde’s sluggish team could have no complaints about their third consecutive quarter-final exit, even though Roma tortured their fans by leaving it late and almost blew it when a defensive mix-up presented Ousmane Dembélé with an opportunity to rescue La Liga’s champions-elect.His chip drifted over Alisson Becker’s unguarded goal, however, and the truth is that Barcelona, so insipid until they were behind, deserved to go out. They will be no great loss on this evidence, even if neutrals will mourn Messi’s absence from the last four, and no condescension should be aimed at Roma given that Eusebio Di Francesco’s fearless team finished top of a group that contained Atlético Madrid and Chelsea and beat Shakhtar Donetsk in the last 16. Nothing summed up their defiance more than the players who got their second and third goals. Daniele De Rossi and Manolas both scored at the wrong end in the first leg, leaving Roma with an enormous challenge, but they chose the perfect way to respond, standing tall while their opponents cowered.Roma, fourth in Serie A, had leaders all over the pitch. “Mission Impossible” was the headline on the front of Gazzetta dello Sport and even the most devoted follower of I Giallorossi could have been forgiven for thinking Barcelona’s advantage was too imposing. Only 11 sides had recovered after losing the first leg by three goals or more in this competition’s 63-year history and Roma faced opponents who had the safety net of Messi’s genius.But with red smoke billowing out of the brilliantly boisterous Curva Sud and the noise deafening, the hosts wasted no time exposing the frailties in Barcelona’s defence. Alessandro Florenzi’s long pass in the sixth minute was perfectly flighted and the outstanding Edin Dzeko, who had kept the tie alive with his artful poaching in the first leg, bustled Jordi Alba and Samuel Utiti aside before rolling the ball past Marc-André ter Stegen.Valverde will be criticised for his defensive focus. He opted for pragmatism, starting Sergi Roberto and waiting until the 85th minute to introduce Dembélé and Paulinho, and still Barcelona were overwhelmed in midfield, where De Rossi, Radja Nainggolan and Kevin Strootman were powerful, creative and dominant. Luis Suárez’s only noteworthy contribution was picking up a booking for timewasting and it was strange to think that Barcelona remain unbeaten in the league given how reliant they have become on Messi.Alisson was protected by his back three and the damage for Barcelona would have been more severe at half-time if Patrik Schick had shown greater precision with two free headers or Dzeko had snuck another effort past Ter Stegen.The question at the start of the second half was whether Roma would tire after such a frenzied effort. It felt as though any dip in intensity would prove costly, especially when Barcelona began to exert a measure of control in midfield, with Sergio Busquets, Andrés Iniesta and Ivan Rakitic showing signs of gathering their thoughts.The clock was Roma’s enemy. Yet the mood changed when Strootman hounded Iniesta out of possession in the 55th minute, allowing Schick to run at Umtiti. The forward tumbled and appealed in vain for a penalty but Roma had found a second wind and moments later Dzeko was outmuscling Gerard Piqué, turning and preparing to shoot from close range. Piqué’s foul was desperate and this time Clement Turpin, the French referee, awarded a penalty that De Rossi sent past Ter Stegen.It was a cathartic moment for the Roma captain, whose team had more than 30 minutes to find the conclusive breakthrough. They tore forward, Ter Stegen saving from Nainggolan and Stephan El Shaarawy, De Rossi heading just wide, and they breathed a sigh of relief when Messi shot straight at Alisson from 18 yards.That was a reminder of Barça’s lingering threat, yet Roma were far more enterprising and, when Manolas darted to the near post to meet Kolarov’s corner, they were all off the bench to join in the manic celebrations. Even the ball boys were involved. For Roma there were memories to last a lifetime."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04ab8a08954d885d96cd7c0403b3fa020207eba7/0_167_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0ba4749d87e8e0c7642a82f46a3bd07a 1240w","title":"aid early child development education","story":"Calls for urgent action as study shows nutrition and health initiatives take bulk of global funding for children under sixIn order to meet the early childhood development targets set out in the sustainable development goals, donors must take a holistic approach, said the report.The analysis uses data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to compare spending on several key areas where resources can be tracked: health, nutrition, sanitation and pre-primary education. It focuses on spending aimed at children aged from birth to six years old. “Benefits of investing in pre-primary education are found to be the greatest for the most disadvantaged, who are often the least prepared when starting primary school and are therefore most likely to be left behind,” said Sarah Brown, president of Theirworld. “But despite all the evidence, millions of children are continuing to miss out on the chance of a great start in life.” Campaigners have warned repeatedly that education projects are severely underfunded, and those for early years even more so. In February, at a global summit, world leaders promised to spend $2.3bn (£1.6bn) on education over the next three years, following warnings from the World Bank of a “global learning crisis”.

By  Philip Murphy‘So, Professor Murphy,” said the voice at the end of the line. “What does the Commonwealth mean to you?” It was 2014, and I had agreed to do a live interview about the Commonwealth for a radio talk show. Media interest had been sparked by the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, and while I waited, phone in hand, for my turn to speak, the presenter was busily soliciting Commonwealth-related thoughts from anyone he could find on Glasgow’s streets that morning.Finally, just as the clock was ticking towards the very end of the show, the presenter turned his attentions to me. But I was stumped by the question. What does the Commonwealth mean to me? It was only since I had become director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies (ICwS) a few years earlier that it had “meant” anything much at all. And what was that meaning? Lots of drinks receptions in the hollowed-out citadels of Britain’s former imperial power? Endless well-meaning conferences exploring how the Commonwealth could achieve its “true potential”?In the three-and-a-half seconds while all this was racing through my head, the presenter correctly anticipated that a cheery anecdote would not be forthcoming, and moved on to the more concrete question: “What does the Commonwealth actually do?” I blurted out something spectacularly feeble along the lines of: “Well, it doesn’t do very much, but then it doesn’t cost very much.” And that was it – straight into the 10 o’clock news and traffic roundup. Not my finest hour.With the Commonwealth Games taking place at the moment and the biennial Commonwealth heads of government meeting opening in London next week, my institute will again be fielding a high volume of press enquiries. And this time, I’ll be ready for the “What does it mean to you?” question. Back in 2014, I wasn’t. But it was a variant of another question that I had regularly been asked in the five years since I became director of the ICwS: “How did you become interested in the Commonwealth?” There was always an assumption that some element of my upbringing or family history must have sparked my interest in this unique organisation, one that is very largely made up of former parts of the British empire. It currently has 53 members, including Britain itself, which range in size from India, with a population of more than 1.3 billion people, to the tiny Pacific island states of Tuvalu and Nauru, with populations of about 11,000 and 13,000 respectively. But there was nothing I could really point to. I grew up in Hull. Very occasionally we did go overseas on family holidays – but only to the Isle of Man. I can’t remember anyone even mentioning Commonwealth Day while I was at school in the 1970s and 80s. Had they been fee-paying public schools, where a good smattering of the families would probably have had records of imperial service, the situation might have been different. But they most decidedly were not.Later, as a postgraduate student studying how the Conservative party reacted to the decolonisation of Africa, I became familiar with the idea of the Commonwealth as a great, soothing comfort blanket for the party’s dwindling band of post-second world war imperial enthusiasts. They could reassure themselves that the sad business of granting independence to British colonies wasn’t really the end of the line. Like the souls of the faithful departed, these countries would simply join the heavenly throng of the Commonwealth and live in eternal peace and harmony.For the next 20 years or so, insofar as I thought about the Commonwealth, it was largely as a relatively minor aspect of British foreign policy. During the postwar period, the organisation had moved from being seen as an essential prop of Britain’s “great power” status to representing a puzzle, then an irritant, and finally a constant source of disappointment. It has maintained a loyal band of supporters, mostly concentrated in a series of London-based affiliated organisations. Yet even they often seem unable to provide any very convincing reasons for their enthusiasm.Suddenly, people started to talk about the Commonwealth again. The trouble was that most of what they were saying was nonsense.In the weeks after Britain voted for Brexit, as I tried to come to terms with what seemed to me an unmitigated disaster, there were always sympathetic friends on hand to make matters worse. “You’re at the centre of things now,” they said. “You must be very busy. Apparently the Commonwealth is the way of the future.” To which, as the director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, my response was: “If the Commonwealth is the future, then we’re in even more trouble than I thought.”Despite the leave campaign’s best efforts to turn the Commonwealth into a symbol of Britain’s ability to stand on the international stage independently of the EU, its power and influence has long been on the wane. Just a year before the Brexit referendum, the party manifestos for the UK general election reflected the Commonwealth’s diminished importance. In place of Labour’s 1997 vow to give renewed priority to this “unique network of contacts linked by history, language and legal systems”, the party now barely mentioned it. The Conservatives were a little more forthcoming, although they largely cut and pasted the words from their 2010 document. Ukip, predictably, scattered in references far more frequently than anyone else. Yet even they had dropped a startlingly ambitious proposal that had featured in its 2010 manifesto, to establish “a Commonwealth Free Trade Area” with the other Commonwealth countries.So, how exactly did it manage to shuffle its way back into the political conversation? For the leave campaign, depicting the Commonwealth as a huge potential trading opportunity for the UK was a useful fiction. This was reassuring mood music for a campaign keen to demonstrate that Britain would not be left helpless and isolated after Brexit. Yet beyond a few hand-me-down figures about its supposed economic potential, there were few clues about how or why the volume of trade with Commonwealth member states would be increased.Although the Commonwealth featured as an element in the snake oil sold to voters by the leave campaign, it was by no means the most potent ingredient. Indeed, many Brexiters struggled with the whole concept of the Commonwealth. On the one hand, it fed into their arguments that Britain had the opportunity to engage more actively with growing economies outside the EU. But it also sat uneasily within a campaign that had focused sharply on the issue of immigration.Once the result was announced, some of Britain’s most prominent Commonwealth enthusiasts began celebrating. Less than a week after the vote, the Daily Telegraph carried an article by David Howell, then chairman of the Royal Commonwealth Society, under the headline “A bright future awaits Britain post-Brexit in the Commonwealth markets”. It rehearsed a series of arguments that had been regularly trotted out for two decades, including the idea of a “Commonwealth advantage” in terms of the ease and cost of trade, and the notion that the world’s future growth areas would be outside the EU: “It is to Asia, Africa and Latin America we need to look for the big prizes, and the Commonwealth network is the gateway to many of these fast-growing new economies,” Lord Howell wrote.Given the ever more certain prospect that we will, indeed, leave the EU, it is worth looking closely at whether there is anything to this view. The origins of Howell’s argument go back to a brief and not very well-substantiated 1994 article by the Australian scholar Katherine West, titled “Britain, the Commonwealth and the Global Economy”, which was published in the the Commonwealth Journal of International Affairs. The piece began with the proposition that, for the UK, Europe had “become an economic black spot, with double-digit unemployment and the lowest rates of growth in the developed world”. It suggested that the British government’s “Eurocentric political rhetoric” tended to disguise the importance to Britain of markets outside the EU. West then moved to note “the spectacular economic growth” of Asian markets, suggesting again that “myopic concentration” on Europe on the part of British policymakers was an impediment to the exploitation of these markets.Tony Blair’s New Labour government, which took office in May 1997, initially seemed keen to run with this idea. The UK was about to host a Commonwealth heads of government meeting for the first time in 20 years, and the idea of the Commonwealth as an instrument to promote British trade seemed a useful way of fitting this rather creaking institution into New Labour’s modernising agenda.This new commercially minded love affair between the Blair government and the Commonwealth was, however, fairly shortlived. In the short term, Blair himself seemed disillusioned from virtually his first sight of the Commonwealth in action, irritated by the drawn-out and inconclusive nature of the Edinburgh Commonwealth heads of government meeting. In the longer term, and particularly after 911, Blair’s attentions focused on Anglo-American relations and the Middle East.Nevertheless, it was clear that promoting the notion of the Commonwealth as an under-utilised business asset was a way of persuading the British government to take it seriously. During the next two decades, bodies such as the Royal Commonwealth Society, the Commonwealth Business Council and the Commonwealth Secretariat pushed the idea vigorously. In particular, they suggested that there was a “Commonwealth effect” that rendered intra-Commonwealth trade cheaper and easier – an idea that can be traced directly to West’s 1994 article.These figures are now regularly rehearsed at Commonwealth gatherings, but there has been little objective analysis of this report, and we might well be cautious in reading too much into them. First, as the study notes, there are wide variations in the extent to which inidual Commonwealth countries trade with others. For some, the proportion is relatively low. The UK and Canada are mentioned in this context as countries “positioned close to large non-Commonwealth markets”. By contrast, there are other member states, including Singapore and Malaysia, that enjoy greater geographical proximity to major Commonwealth trading partners, and so conduct a much higher proportion of intra-Commonwealth trade. Given this, and the fact that there are huge variations in the levels of trade conducted by inidual member states, it is difficult to see what we can actually learn from an average figure for “Commonwealth advantage” between two notional Commonwealth states.It is worth noting, too, that in the run-up to the referendum, Commonwealth member states were virtually as one in wishing Britain to remain part of the EU. Behind this uncharacteristic outbreak of unanimity is the simple fact that Brexit throws the UK’s future trading relationships into confusion. The working assumption is that the current EU agreements, which allow many developing Commonwealth countries access to the UK market on advantageous terms, will lapse in Britain at the moment that Brexit takes effect. It will only be after that point that the UK has the legal capacity to negotiate trade agreements independently of the EU.This means many less-developed Commonwealth countries that currently conduct a significant proportion of their trade with the UK risk being hit by an immediate tariff hike. Given the finite resources available to the UK government for complex trade negotiations, and that attention is likely to be focused on the more lucrative markets of Europe, Asia and North America, Commonwealth countries quite reasonably fear that they will be a relatively low priority for Brexit Britain. The UK is also a major contributor to the EU aid budget, from which many Commonwealth countries benefit, and British overseas dependencies face the prospect of losing access to this important source of development funding altogether.In October 2010, Michael Ancram – then the former Conservative shadow foreign secretary – published a pamphlet setting out a new agenda for British foreign policy. The document, titled Farewell to Drift: A New Foreign Policy for a Network World, showed the influence of David Howell’s worldview: the forces of globalisation were steadily undermining the significance of old-fashioned power blocs such as the EU. Conversely, the Commonwealth, with its lack of treaty or constitution and its emphasis on collaboration and mutual support, was “a readymade vehicle for positive action”.“For too long the Commonwealth has been under-funded and underappreciated by many of its members, including the UK,” Ancram wrote. “For us it costs only 20p per person per year, while the EU costs £52 per person per year. It urgently needs, with British help, encouragement and involvement to become a bolder organisation that recognises its own strengths. It could have associate members as well as new members indeed some of the giants of the world like Japan could become interested, especially if it is based in the emerging powerhouse of India. It is in our interest to encourage such countries to become involved in the Commonwealth in one way or another.”During the 2016 referendum campaign, Ancram duly pinned his colours firmly to the leave mast. His encomium nicely encapsulated many elements of the British myth of the Commonwealth. This includes the tension between wishing to use the organisation more effectively, and disavowing any wish to lead it. Ancram was not the first Commonwealth enthusiast to recommend moving its headquarters to India, the most populous member state – but, more than seven years since the publication of his pamphlet, that prospect is no less remote. With many members of India’s policymaking elite seeing the Commonwealth as little more than a quaint relic of British imperialism, there is little chance of them offering it this sort of flag of convenience. There was also something familiar in Ancram’s ambiguous contrast between the supposed 20p cost of the Commonwealth, against the EU’s £52. Were we supposed to conclude that the Commonwealth is better value for money, or simply that it is under-resourced?Commonwealth enthusiasts generally want to have it both ways: the Commonwealth has supposedly vast potential (thus the idea of Japan joining as an associate member), which could be augmented further with a little additional funding, yet membership will always remain cheaper than the EU, and not only in terms of the UK’s direct financial contribution. Somehow, this mythical Commonwealth of the future will cost less than the EU in terms of the vast number of hours required to negotiate its treaties and other formal agreements it will not require members to make significant concessions in return for some collective good and it will have only the most rudimentary of mechanisms to enforce its will.In this light, the Commonwealth is the international relations equivalent of a homeopathic remedy – a cadre of staff so small as to be almost invisible when dissolved across a body comprising 2.4 billion people, which nevertheless does or could achieve miraculous results. But the promise of the Commonwealth can be seen in another, arguably far more realistic way. It is based on the prospect offered by charlatans and quacks throughout the ages – that of something for nothing.In the decades since the second world war, the process of devising and agreeing mechanisms for European cooperation has indeed been time-consuming and expensive. But it has resulted in a series of concrete achievements, above all the creation of the world’s largest free-trading bloc. Decisions made at an EU level affect the texture of daily life in its member states in the way that the Commonwealth’s empty pronouncements do not. As a result, any contemporary survey of international relations since 1945 is likely to devote considerable space to the EU and little or none to the Commonwealth. Frankly, the EU matters, in a way that the Commonwealth does not.This has long been apparent to those within the UK government who engage directly with the Commonwealth. It is far less obvious, however, to the vast majority of people in the UK, who know the organisation largely through occasional high-profile events such as the Commonwealth Games, and through the annual round-robin delivered in the Queen’s speech. It is at this level, and in this specifically British context, that the myth of the Commonwealth is arguably most dangerous. It encourages perceptions of the organisation as some sort of genuine global network with the UK at its centre, the other members ready to fall into line and embrace the prodigal mother whenever Britain finally decides that it is time to resume a guiding role.It was this combination of a widespread unfamiliarity with how the modern Commonwealth actually functions, and a lingering sense that it is in some way a special asset to the UK, that allowed some in the leave camp to present it during the 2016 referendum campaign as a direct alternative to the EU. This was despite the fact that the vast majority of Commonwealth members, and indeed the secretary general, Patricia Scotland, emphasised that membership of both organisations was not only wholly compatible but also mutually beneficial. The referendum result marked the point when the Commonwealth ceased to be simply a puzzle in Whitehall – an itch the civil service didn’t quite know how or where to scratch – and became a contributory factor in, arguably, Britain’s greatest foreign policy disaster since the end of the second world war.What, then, should be the basis of the UK’s future relationship with the Commonwealth? It could be argued that the referendum result has already ordained that this relationship will be an ever-closer one. But I doubt that. Brexit is unlikely to enhance British trade with Commonwealth countries. Indeed, in the short term, it might actually reduce it, as the UK struggles to replicate deals already in place under its EU membership. There may be closer trading and diplomatic relations with Australia and New Zealand, which represent the acceptable face of the organisation to those leave supporters who continue to regard the citizens of the notional white Commonwealth as “kith and kin”. But when it comes to the genuinely vast potential of the Indian market, a UK government driven by the anti-immigration agenda of leave voters is unlikely to make great strides in that direction. For example, India seems likely to want a relaxation of visa restrictions on its nationals in return for trade liberalisation. Certainly, the issue of immigration overshadowed Theresa May’s visit there in November 2016, leading to accusations that the UK wanted India’s business, but not its people. And whatever the future holds, invoking the name of the Commonwealth is unlikely to oil the wheels of any trade deal.As the Commonwealth summit in London approaches, get ready to hear about the long list of good causes – from ending war and poverty to tackling climate change, and from spreading democracy to promoting gender equality – that the organisation champions. All of this is, indeed, laudable. But given the Commonwealth’s record in recent years, one would need a great deal of faith and a remarkably short memory to believe that the organisation really can make a significant contribution in any of these areas. What is surely beyond doubt is that the Commonwealth cannot rescue the UK from the grievous, self-inflicted wound of Brexit. And any suggestion that it can will only serve to rob the organisation of whatever last vestiges of credibility it still possesses.Adapted from The Empire’s New Clothes: The Myth of the Commonwealth by Philip Murphy, published by Hurst on 19 April• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57c2c6cc3e19ffa370cae85b4d0d13dc9f435f0d/0_0_4582_2651/master/4582.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c94b6db33526686d55a66c1b1e3001d 720w","title":"save the children inquiry staff misconduct brendan cox","story":"Move follows complaints about employees’ behaviour and exit of senior staff membersSave the Children, the global charity mired in allegations that it failed to investigate sexual abuse and inappropriate behaviour by staff, is to be formally investigated by the Charity Commission. In a statement announcing a statutory inquiry, the commission said it had been prompted by “concerns about the charity’s handling, reporting and response to serious allegations of misconduct and harassment against senior staff members in 2012 and 2015”.The commission describes a statutory inquiry as its “most serious form of engagement” with a charity. The news, announced on Tuesday night, will be another blow for the charity two months after it emerged that both Justin Forsyth, its former chief executive, and Brendan Cox, the former policy director and widower of the MP Jo Cox, left the charity in 2015 following allegations of misconduct. The two men knew each other from their years working for Gordon Brown and the Labour party.After he left Save the Children, Forsyth went on to a senior role at Unicef. He resigned in February after the reports of inappropriate behaviour emerged. Cox also resigned from the charities More in Common and the Jo Cox Foundation, set up in the aftermath of his wife’s murder.The commission, which itself has been criticised for failing to follow up allegations involving the charities it polices, has been working with Save the Children since the facts about Forsyth and Cox emerged in the wake of the scandal involving Oxfam workers in Haiti.Save the Children is already reviewing its workplace culture and the implementation of recommendations made by a previous review. But the Charity Commission said its recent work with it, and new information from other sources that has recently come into the regulator’s possession, meant that the commission wanted to make further inquiries.It says it is concerned about how the 2015 allegations were reported to the commission, and how other complaints were handled and reviewed. It also questions “the charity’s decision-making since February 2018 on its public position regarding these allegations”.In wording that suggests that new witnesses may have come forward, the statement says the investigation will look at the frankness of the charity’s disclosure to the commission of “serious incidents relating to staffing matters”. However, the investigation is only into the management of the charity itself, not its charitable work. It will take place in private, hearing evidence from staff, past and present and any other witnesses, and examining documentation. It will be conducted by the commission’s investigations and enforcement unit, headed by Michelle Russell. But charity law is intended to ensure that charities serve their beneficiaries, and although the report will be published, the commission has no power of sanction. A spokesman emphasised that the decision to open a statutory investigation did not mean it had established any evidence of wrongdoing. It carried out more than 100 such inquiries last year. In February, Save the Children’s current chief executive, Kevin Watkins, announced a “root and branch review” of the charity’s organisational culture, including measures to preserve staff safety and “any behavioural challenges among senior leadership”. The charity said the review would commence by the end of this week and that it would report its findings in June. The final report will be “published, shared with the Charity Commission and made available to government and every single member of staff”.In evidence to a House of Commons committee at the time, Watkins said Save the Children dealt with 193 child protection and 35 sexual harassment cases involving allegations against its staff around the world last year. He told the international development select committee that the misconduct cases in 120 countries led to 30 dismissals.A Save the Children spokesman said: “We apologise for any pain these matters have caused and sincerely hope that the complainants feel able to help us with the review in the coming weeks. “This is so that we can better support our skilled and highly valued staff as they help change the lives of millions of children around the world every day.” As the scandal threatened the vital work of numerous charities, the heads of 22 aid organisations took the unprecedented step of apologising for the sector’s failure to tackle sexual abuse. They vowed to toughen safeguards against misconduct.The letter, signed by the heads of ActionAid UK, Christian Aid, Cafod, Care International UK, as well as Oxfam, Save the Children and others, said: “We are truly sorry.”The scandal has been blamed for last month’s Sport Relief event raising a third less than expected on the night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8813d562fb0761a4cd3a8522467584fe5b7d081/466_0_3249_1949/master/3249.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=797013dc488a89a275659f39898ec14b 1240w","title":"commonwealth games england not doing so good largest team 5m","story":"Largest ever team to leave these shores is trailing Australia by a distance and the administrative backup has missed a trick tooTeam England ticked very few boxes at the Commonwealth Games on Tuesday, from the support officials who incomprehensibly botched the entry form for the cyclist Melissa Lowther to the athletes who became the latest high-profile names to fail to win medals.With 390 athletes and 198 support staff, the England party is the largest ever sent from home shores to a sporting event, comfortably eclipsing the Great Britain team which travelled to the 2016 Olympics. At a cost of £5m of taxpayers’ and national lottery money to cover a preparation camp in Brisbane, flights, kit and other expenses, it has not come cheap. As the established names, arguably those most likely to inspire the future generation, continued to fall by the wayside on Tuesday through injury or lack of performance, it became increasingly difficult to defend that sum.Tom Daley, one of a handful of household names here, announced he was withdrawing from the 10m platform inidual event because of a hip injury. By nightfall on Australia’s east coast the weather had turned grisly, thrashing rain soaking spectators at the Carrara Stadium and English athletes producing performances to match.Andrew Pozzi, a world champion with every opportunity to win, finished joint sixth in the 110m hurdles final, beating only one man. Ahead of him were Cyprus’s Milan Trajkovic, whose only senior titles are a pair of golds at the Games of the Small States of Europe, and the Australian bronze medallist Nicholas Hough, ranked 43rd in the world last year. “It doesn’t take a brain surgeon to see I should have been fighting for the medals,” Pozzi said. “I was in good enough shape to win a medal. These opportunities don’t come up often, so I have to wait another four years.”In the hammer the Olympic bronze medallist Sophie Hitchon conceded she might need to fine-tune a new technique she is experimenting with after three foul throws left her in last place. The 26-year-old had entered the contest as favourite, expected at the very least to improve on the Commonwealth bronze medal she won at Glasgow in 2014. Her capitulation encapsulated a miserable Games for England’s most well-known performers.There have been notable exceptions, particularly at the Aquatics Centre, where Ben Proud defended his 50m freestyle title, but even he was making amends for disqualification in the 50m butterfly, an event in which he was also reigning champion, earlier in the week. “When I lost the opportunity to retain my 50m fly title I really was clinging on to what I had left,” Proud said after winning in 21.35sec, half a second ahead of South Africa’s Bradley Tandy and Cameron McEvoy of Australia.Despite a slew of medals in the pool and at the gymnastics, where Nile Wilson has repeatedly performed, the gap to the home nation in the overall standings is growing. With 130 medals, including 50 golds, Australia are not going to be caught by England, who have 74, including 24 gold. “The tiny island nation of England are not doing so good,” cackled a DJ on a local radio station.The Brownlee brothers had set the tone in the triathlon on the opening morning of competition. Alistair, a double Olympic champion, trailed home in 10th while Jonny, who has claimed silver and bronze medals behind his sibling, was seventh. Both cited injury but neither seemed particularly cut by the defeat.Max Whitlock is Olympic champion on the floor but could finish only seventh, beaten by the Cypriot Marios Georgiou, a part-time dancer who goes by the name “street boy killer”. To his credit Whitlock fronted up after his defeat and said he was still getting used to a new routine but it did call into question how important the Commonwealth Games is to athletes who know there are bigger tests round the corner.The curse of the champions continued as Adam Peaty, fresh from winning the 100m breaststroke, was also defeated for the first time in four years in the 50m breaststroke at a Games which is showing little regard for bookmakers’ odds. Peaty reasoned that swimmers typically peak in the summer months, not in April when they would usually be in heavy training.The same is true in athletics but Adam Gemili, another name who withdrew with injury, said he felt the time of year is irrelevant. “We all knew it was going to be in April and had plenty of time to prepare for that,” he said. “It shouldn’t really be an excuse for anyone. It’s more just unfortunate circumstances and a bit of bad luck.”The chef de mission, Sarah Winckless, might have been tempted to implore the team’s big names to raise their game but she is occupying shaky ground when it comes to performance. The team’s leader was forced to apologise to the 21-year-old Lowther after she was unable to compete in the cycling because an official failed to tick a box on an entry form for the time trial.The extraordinary administrative error was not spotted until it was too late, despite “seven or eight” layers of checks when the mistake could have been identified. Despite the reputation of the Commonwealth Games as the “friendly games”, the organisers refused to bend the rules to allow her to race. It is understood she is devastated and her family, who were hoping to watch her on the TV from their home in Wakefield, are furious.Winckless, a world champion rower in 2005 and 2006, offered a personal apology to Lowther. “No athlete should suffer because of an administrative error by my group,” she said. “As soon as we knew of the error we did everything to rectify it and it went to the Commonwealth Games Federation re-allocation committee – unfortunately they were not minded to add her into the draw.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73e84e70e20cfa198d5b02fa2348df3c456e2c71/9_78_2028_1216/master/2028.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8d9714429f0ef00ef4d6002da0e9cf34 1240w","title":"grand national aintree course heavy red marauder 2001","story":"• Bad weather leaves Aintree ‘heavy in places’, says course clerk• Only four horses finished almost unraceable National 17 years agoThe going on the Grand National course at Aintree was “heavy in places” on Tuesday evening after 8mm of rain fell at the track in 24 hours, raising the possibility the conditions on Saturday will be the most demanding since Red Marauder’s 33-1 success in 2001.“We were due a couple of millimetres on Monday night and a couple more early morning,” Andrew Tulloch, Aintree’s clerk of the course, said. “But unfortunately we got a lot more than that. Hopefully it will dry a bit before Thursday and it looks like we’ve had most of the rain.“But having said that, temperatures haven’t really got up much. It feels more like autumn than spring, it’s significantly colder than yesterday and, if it had just gone up a couple of degrees with a bit of sunshine, that would have helped. But that’s Mother Nature for you.”The ground was close to unraceable 17 years ago, when the four finishers from 40 starters included two horses that had been remounted by their jockeys, a practice now banned. The race was the second to be run on heavy ground in a four-year period, following Earth Summit’s win in 1998 when six of 37 starters completed, including one that had been remounted.Only two Grand Nationals since 2001 have been run on going any slower than good-to-soft but with some rain in the forecast for Aintree on Thursday and Friday, the ground seems likely to be soft at best. As a result, the betting could change significantly as punters latch on to runners with low weights and proven form on heavy ground.The first major gamble of the week arrived on Tuesday, as Ross O’Sullivan’s mare Baie Des Iles was backed down to a top price of 20-1 having been available at 66-1 last week. Katie Walsh, O’Sullivan’s wife, will be in the grey’s saddle as she bids to become the first female jockey to win the National, and Baie Des Iles not only has form at extreme distances and on soft ground but is also set to carry only 10st 7lb this weekend.“Baie Des Iles could end up being our worst result,” Rupert Adams, a spokesman for William Hill, said on Tuesday. “She will love the ground, is a grey and most importantly has Katie Walsh on board. It is a possible perfect storm.”Walsh is one of three female jockeys expected to line up for Saturday’s race, and Milansbar, the mount of Bryony Frost, is another soft-ground specialist that could attract support if the ground remains slow.“When he won at Warwick, Bryony had never sat on him before and she just gelled with him straight away,” Robert Bothway, Milansbar’s owner, said on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27dd3f8e30a7daa658b96d250cda81247f49d297/152_81_2371_1422/master/2371.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3c2d05bad64789f8548bce40c86806ec 1240w","title":"leicester ben youngs dodged bullet northampton comeback","story":"If the enduring image of England’s opening Six Nations victory in Italy was a quartet of Exeter players deep in celebration, oblivious to the downward spiral that was to follow, then the lingering sound was unmistakably that of Ben Youngs crying out in pain.Youngs’ tournament lasted only 10 minutes before suffering a knee injury which at the time looked likely to end his season, possibly even his chances of touring South Africa. The shriek of agony said as much and Eddie Jones knew only too well that the prognosis was not good, seconding Richard Wigglesworth within minutes of the final whistle.“I got a bit of stick for the yelp,” says Youngs. “Sometimes it is the fear of what it might be, especially when it is your knee. When something like that happens you fear the worst. But I certainly feel like I dodged a bullet. The results of the scan showed that I didn’t need an operation and that ice and corrective rehab would get me right, and I knew that I would still be able to play at the back-end of the season.”It is too simplistic to pin England’s subsequent stumbles on one single factor – the breakdown, Billy Vunipola’s absence or fatigue, for example – but of all the excuses offered up, Youngs’ injury seems as valid as any. Danny Care had nowhere near the impact he tends to when habitually replacing Youngs after an hour and Wigglesworth, truth be told, toiled on his international comeback. Leicester’s head coach, Matt O’Connor, was not exaggerating when he remarked that Youngs had been “drastically missed”.Youngs chose to keep his distance from the England squad during his lay-off, opting against fulfilling any commercial duties at Twickenham or offering any advice in the WhatsApp group, instead watching from the sofa with the knee in a brace. The road to recovery has been a smooth one – surgery was avoided – and he is ready to make his comeback against Northampton on Saturday with Leicester currently third and, as they always tend to do, timing their play-off push perfectly.“I was in a brace, sleeping in it, in it 24-7. I was on crutches, I couldn’t really do a lot so I would have been completely in the way. It was my decision to watch from home – you see a lot more on the TV. I’m not one that gets up and down and starts throwing things but I get a little bit animated. I care about that group.”If England have keenly felt Youngs’ absence, however, Leicester have not. The Tigers have won their last five in the Premiership, having ended 2017 with a run of six straight defeats. Indeed, it was not so long ago that O’Connor’s position was under threat but Youngs pinpoints the victory at Saracens in February as the seminal moment of the season. Furthermore Leicester have a habit of improving as winter turns to spring – since the Premiership adopted a four-team format for the 2005-06 season the Tigers have been ever-present. And victory over their east Midlands rival Northampton would go a long way to securing their place this season.“We just seem to start randomly at the beginning of the year, then we get our act together,” says Youngs. “I think the pride that we’ve always made the top four helps. Even when we’ve had seasons when it’s been really disruptive and we’ve had coaches come and go, we’ve still always had that resilience. We’ve been able to do that even when we were faced with adversity.”Land Rover, the official vehicle partner of Premiership Rugby, is celebrating 10 seasons of supporting grassroots rugby in the UK.

Australia’s men have beaten New Zealand 2-1 in a very nervy hockey meeting between the two in Pool A. India duel with England shortly, while Canada take on South Africa, from the same group. Story of the day contender: Five Cameroonian athletes have been reported missing from the athletes village, with suspicion they have fled with the intention not to return home.In the badminton, Ciaran Chambers, of Northern Ireland, has been defeated by Sri Lanka in the round of 32, but earlier, Rajiv Ouseph got the better of Uganda’s Ekiring. In the women’s singles, it’s England v Jersey, with Chloe Birch taking on Elise Dixon. We are an hour away from Jack Laugher, the Olympic champion, defending his title. He’s in the 1m springboard final, after breezing through the preliminaries this morning. Laugher is one of five from the home nations in a 12-strong final. After that, Lois Toulson and Robyn Birch will be in action in the 10m women’s platform.The rhythmic gymnastics team finals are under way, with the first rotation in full swing. England and Wales are both in contention. All we can think of really, though, is this, right?In the netball, Uganda are getting the better of Scotland, to the tune of a 51-35 scoreline.

Before the athletics kicks in, in around an hour or so, in the pool, there’s the men’s 1m springboard final and, a little later, the women’s synchronised 10m platform medal event. Once we return to the track and field, we have the men’s high jump final, long jump and, lastly, the women’s 400m. Elsewhere, there will be plenty of fun and games in the shape of badminton, beach volleyball, hockey and table tennis.

And what a goal it was. Jacob Whetton picked up the ball on the right byline, dribbled into the circle and from an impossibly acute angle lifted the ball past the keeper and into the top side netting of the far post. That was eye of the needle stuff. So it’s 1-0 Australia with seven minutes remaining in the second quarter.And with that goal I shall pull stumps for the evening. Fear not, I leave you in the very capable hands of Ben Fisher. Enjoy your evening.Australia and New Zealand are 0-0 at the end of the first quarter of their Pool A men’s hockey clash.

Scotland’s McMath and the Isle of Man’s Kneale still in the hunt, just two behind.Unfortunately for the home crowd, and himself, Willett is the first man eliminated from the final six. India’s Mittal leads with 28 from 30 shots, with McMath and Kneale on 26.India have put in a lot of resources into strengthening their shooting team and it’s paying off at these Games.We’re back at the Belmont Shooting Centre for the men’s double trap final. Australia’s James Willett is in the hunt alongside India’s Ankur Mittal and Ashab Mohd, Scotland’s David McMath, and the Isle of Man’s Tim Kneale. Also in action is Pakistan’s Aamer Iqbal.The way this final works is that after each round one shooter drops off and the remaining shooters go at it again. So, it’s pretty much like The Hunger Games. Or perhaps like Stephen King’s The Long Walk, a story about an endurance race in which competitors get shot dead when they drop below an assigned pace. The winner is the last man standing.In the men’s hockey Pakistan and Malaysia are 1-1 in their Pool B match as the fourth quarter gets underway. Australia and New Zealand will be banging heads in about 45 minutes.More updates from earlier action:Northern Ireland’s Kristina O’Hara won her semifinal in the women’s boxing 45-48kg ision meaning she will take on India’s MC Mery Kom for the gold on Saturday.In the shoot-off Singh hits both targets, while Cox hits only one. Gold to Singh! Cox will be shattered having taken a healthy lead into the final round. Even after a shaky start she needed to hit ‘just’ 7 of the last 12 targets to secure the gold but she hit only six, which meant a shoot-off was necessary.Singh’s consistency has seen her win India’s 12th gold medal of these Games.But Cox falters down the stretch, scoring 18 to Singh’s 25, which means she finishes level with Singh on 96! The pair will have a shoot-off for gold.Scotland’s Linda Pearson, meantime, has secured the bronze medal! The women’s double trap final is underway at the Belmont Shooting Centre. We’re in the fourth and final round and Australia’s Emma Cox, who was leading into the final round, is currently looking to overhaul India’s Shreyasi Singh who has completed her fourth round. Singh has 96 points in the bank after a final round 25.If you’re unfamiliar with the double trap, it’s that event where competitors, armed with a shotgun, aim to hit clay targets lobbed into the air. As the name suggests, in the double trap two clay targets are launched at a time which requires the shooter to nail the first target, scan the sky and hit the second before it drops to the ground. Cox is a school teacher in Victoria and clearly has a good eye. Are teachers still allowed to throw blackboard dusters are students like they did back in the day? You wouldn’t test Cox’s aim if they were.As I write, Cox draws to within 3 points of Singh and appears to have this one in the bag!Underway right now at the Coomera Indoor Sports Centre are qualifiers in rhythmic gymnastics. It really is remarkable what these young women and girls are able to do. Strength, speed, grace and the kind of hand eye coordination that would see them put in the first slip position were they to put their hand to cricket. Some of the catches are remarkable.In case you’ve missed it, five Cameroonian athletes have been reported as missing. Here’s our report:At 4.30pm today Australia’s Kookaburras (that’s the men’s hockey team, for those not familiar with the home nation’s penchant for naming their national sporting teams after native animals) will play New Zealand is the preliminary rounds. Before that, Malaysia will take on Pakistan. That match is due to get underway soon and I’ll endeavour to keep you posted.A reminder that women’s 3m synchro final was held earlier with Australia’s Esther Qin and Georgia Sheehan coming from the clouds to win the gold. They came good when it counted most, executing their final e with aplomb and nary asplash when their rivals faltered. One of those rivals was fellow Aussies Maddison Keeney and Anabelle Smith who recorded a failed e in their final round while in the gold medal position.As I mentioned, it’s been a good morning for Australia’s Daniel Repacholi who won gold in the 50m pistol event. In what was his last Commonwealth Games before retirement, the 35-year-old bear-of-a-man with a bushranger beard thick enough to house a family of marsupials backed up wins in Melbourne 2006 and Glasgow 2014 to take his third Commonwealth Games crown.He won with a 6.7-point margin from Bangladesh’s Shakil Ahmed and India’s Om Mitharval.“It’s f---ing awesome,” said Repacholi, who finished fourth in his only other event on Monday, the 10m air pistol.“I came here for two, but I got one. I can walk away with that and hold my head high.“The other day it didn’t work for me, it just wasn’t my time, but this time it worked fine.”Here we go again. It may be the seventh day but there is no rest in sight for the athletes of these Games, with another 15 gold medals up for grabs in the glorious Gold Coast sunshine.Two of those have already been secured: Daniel Repacholi, the Australian with the monster frame and a beard to match, won the 50m pistol final in a Games record at Belmont Shooting Centre in Brisbane and Esther Qin and Georgia Sheehan, also of Australia, claimed the women’s synchronised 3m springboard in the ing pool.The Australian pair won with a score of 284.10, ahead of England’s Alicia Blagg and Katherine Torrance in second. But it was agony for another Australian duo, Maddison Keeney and Anabelle Smith, who were left disappointed after recording a failed e while in the gold medal position.There has been a degree of drama on the netball court too, with New Zealand’s Silver Ferns going down to England 54-45 to cast doubt on their hopes of reaching a medal match. Various events in the badminton, boxing, ing, hockey, gymnastics, squash, table tennis and lawn bowling are also underway – we’ll keep you updated throughout the Queensland day.Coming up later we’ll be able to feast on athletics, beach volleyball and more netball. To think this is one of the “quieter” days of competition.As for those medals, here’s what is left to be won today:"},{"url":null,"title":"zuckerberg facebook testimony latest news regulation congress","story":"Facebook’s CEO appeared before Congress in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal to address concerns over users’ dataMark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, warned on Tuesday of an online propaganda “arms race” with Russia and vowed that fighting interference in elections around the world is now his top priority.The 33-year-old billionaire, during testimony that lasted nearly five hours, was speaking to Congress in what was widely seen as a moment of reckoning for America’s tech industry. It came in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which, Facebook has admitted, the personal information of up to 87 million users were harvested without their permission.Zuckerberg’s comments gave an insight into the unnerving reach and influence of Facebook in numerous democratic societies. “The most important thing I care about right now is making sure no one interferes in the various 2018 elections around the world,” he said under questioning by Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico.The senator made reference to a billboard displayed earlier in the hearing that showed images – including Trump, the Green Party candidate Jill Stein, and the Confederate flag – allegedly spread online by Russian operatives during the 2016 presidential election. He asked if Zuckerberg could guarantee such images would not appear on Facebook again.“Senator, no, I can’t guarantee that because this is an ongoing arms race,” the CEO said. “As long as there are people sitting in Russia whose job it is to try and interfere with elections around the world, this is going to be an ongoing conflict.”Earlier in the hearing, Zuckerberg acknowledged that “one of my greatest regrets in running the company” was being slow to uncover and act against disinformation campaigns by Russian trolls during the election.The blockbuster joint hearing of the US Senate’s commerce and judiciary committees on Capitol Hill was a humbling moment for the young entrepreneur. Wearing a suit, white shirt and sky blue tie instead of his customary T-shirt, he sat contrite and silent as senator after senator expressed deep concerns about the company’s gathering of personal information.Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat, told him: “Let me just cut to the chase. If you and other social media companies do not get your act in order, none of us are going to have any privacy any more. If Facebook and other online companies will not or cannot fix the privacy invasions, then we are going to have to. We, the Congress.”Senator John Thune, a Republican and the chairman of the Senate commerce committee, noted that Facebook’s business model offers a free service in exchange for personal data. “For this model to persist, both sides of the bargain need to know what’s involved,” he said. “I’m not convinced Facebook’s users have the information they need to make decisions.”Thune added: “Mr Zuckerberg, in many ways you and the company that you’ve created, the story you’ve created, represent the American dream ... At the same time, you have an obligation, and it’s up to you, to ensure that dream doesn’t become a privacy nightmare for the scores of people who use Facebook.”Zuckerberg and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, have been on a media apology tour since the Cambridge Analytica story broke in the Observer, the Guardian’s sister Sunday newspaper in the UK, and he continued to apologize several times during Tuesday’s hearing.Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook should not have trusted Cambridge Analytica’s assurance that it would stop using the personal information it harvested. “In retrospect, that was a mistake. We shouldn’t have taken their word for it. We considered that a closed case.” He admitted that Facebook did not alert the Federal Trade Commission about the data collection. Under questioning, he promised that Facebook was conducting a “full investigation” into every app that has access to users’ information, numbering tens of thousands. “If we find they’re doing anything improper, we’ll ban them from Facebook,” he said.He also initially claimed that Cambridge Analytica had not been an advertiser in 2015 but, after a brief adjournment in which he consulted with staff, he corrected himself: it had indeed been an advertiser later that year and therefore could have been banned. When Zuckerberg, who was making his first appearance before Congress, first took his seat, surrounded by a thick forest of clicking cameras, he looked somewhat like a prisoner in the dock. But he seemed to grow in confidence as the afternoon wore on and tried to appear open and cooperative. He frequently used the respectful term “Senator” and complimented them for asking “important questions”, some of which he said “his team” would report back on later.Some senators tried to throw him off balance. John Kennedy of Louisiana said bluntly: “Your user agreement sucks.” Democrat Dick Durbin asked: “Would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?” There was a long pause before Zuckerberg replied: “No.” There was laughter in the room.Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal then almost gave him cause to regret it. He challenged Facebook’s contention that Aleksandr Kogan, a Moldovan-born researcher from Cambridge University, deceived the company when he harvested user data. Blumenthal had what he claimed was a previously undisclosed 2014 terms of service document that explicitly permitted Kogan to “sell, licence (by whatever means and on whatever terms) and archive your contribution and data”.Blumenthal said: “We’ve seen the apology tours before. You have refused to acknowledge even an ethical violation to report this violation of the FTC consent decree. My reservation about your testimony today is that I don’t see how you can change your business model unless there are specific rules of the road. Your business model is to maximise profit over privacy.”Several topics dominated the hearing, including the 2016 presidential election. Zuckerberg confirmed that Facebook officials have been interviewed by officials from the special counsel Robert Mueller, who has been investigating Russia’s role in meddling in the 2016 election. “I know we are working with them,” said Zuckerberg, acknowledging that “there may be” a subpoena but he was uncertain.Regulation was also brought up repeatedly, including by the Republican senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, who asked Zuckerberg whether Facebook was a monopoly. “It certainly doesn’t feel like that to me,” he replied, prompting mirth in the public gallery. Graham pressed him on the issue of regulation. Zuckerberg said: “My position is not that there should be no regulation.”Asked if Facebook would therefore embrace regulation, the CEO said: “If it’s the right regulation, then yes.” Graham: “Would you work with us?” Zuckerberg: “Absolutely.”Senator John Cornyn pushed him on whether Facebook is a neutral platform. Zuckerberg replied, “I agree that we are responsible for the content” – a significant concession that could open the way for Facebook to be held to the same legal standards as a traditional media company.Zuckerberg will face a second grilling on Wednesday from the US House energy and commerce committee."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05ef38aafe153279c1860221bf1451a732739ba2/0_221_5000_2998/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ab5da3767efe023dc323cd11e2ed60b5 1240w","title":"amber rudd crackdown dark web","story":"Home secretary pledges £9m to help combat online criminals dealing in drugs, child pornography and gunsHome secretary Amber Rudd is to announce a crackdown on criminals who exploit the dark web in pursuit of drug deals, child pornography, guns, credit scams and other illegal activities. About £9m has been set aside by the Home Office in a push to try to clean up the dark web, a largely hidden part of the internet whose users can operate with relative anonymity.Rudd is to make the announcement on Wednesday afternoon at a conference in Manchester organised by the National Cyber Security Centre, the front window for the government surveillance agency GCHQ.In other measures, more than £5m is to be spent on establishing police units at regional and local level dedicated to help fight cyber crime. Until recently, cyber-crime has not been a priority for police forces, with most under-resourced. An excerpt from Rudd’s speech released in advance pinpoints the dark web as a target. “A dark and dangerous place where anonymity emboldens people to break the law in the most horrifying of ways. A platform of dangerous crimes and horrific abuse. A sickening shopping list of services and products are available.“So today I’m pleased to announce that we will be giving over £9m to enhance the UK’s specialist law enforcement response. They will use this money to help combat the criminals who continually exploit the anonymity of the dark web.”Earlier this year, Matthew Falder, a paedophile operating on the dark web, admitted 137 charges and was sentenced to 32 years. The Home Office funding is part of £1.9bn pledged by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in 2016 to improve the UK’s defences against cyber-attacks, including those on business and infrastructure. The £1.9bn was to cover spending through to 2021. The Home Office is to spend about £50m, including the crackdown on the dark web and cyber capability for the police at regional and local level, during 2018-2019.Rudd will say: “The world of cyber is fast developing and we need a fast-developing response to match, one that recognises that it is the responsibility of everyone in the UK to fight the evolving threat.”More police are to be trained to help them develop the skills needed to investigate cases of cyber-crime.“My own father was the victim of fraud and I know from personal experience the importance of supporting those who have been victimised through no fault of their own. And now that it’s happening online, it’s happening to even more people.”She will add: “But business owners, cyber-security experts and iniduals can do a lot to help too. Because in the same way that shops protect themselves from burglary with locks, alarms and security guards, I expect businesses to take equivalent precautions digitally.”In a separate development, Donald Toon, the director for economic and cyber-crime at the National Crime Agency, one of the co-authors with the NCSC of a report this week on the risks of cyber attacks on business, said the UK is to secure a handful of unexplained wealth orders (UWOs) in the next few months as part of an effort to target assets they suspect are part of money-laundering or other illicit operations.Billions have poured into the UK from Russia, China and the Middle East to buy up property, companies and other investments. UWOs have only been used twice so far, both times on the same inidual. Toon said his officers were working on about 100 cases and he expected about five more UWOs to be issued in the next three months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37de9b683e104cf2334f25e9368a01c378638096/0_0_4175_2505/master/4175.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4c61167b8eed7b6e5255c6aa082da61e 1240w","title":"huawei matebook x pro laptop review slim macbook pro rival","story":"Beautiful screen, excellent keyboard, great trackpad – Huawei’s new machine shows it has what it takes to build a great laptopThe MateBook X Pro is Huawei’s more powerful follow up to last year’s excellent MateBook X, and as the name might imply it is aimed squarely at Apple’s MacBook Pro.PC laptops have come a long way in the last few years, with good design, build and performance – all hallmarks of Apple’s laptop line – now common in the £1,000-plus category.It would be fair to say that the MateBook X Pro has more than a passing resemblance to Apple’s top-end laptop. It’s not that it’s a carbon copy, more a machine that takes just the good bits.With the lid closed it looks like a fairly generic thin-and-light aluminium laptop with a gentle taper and a Huawei logo on the top, available in “space grey” and silver. Open it and you find a MacBook-like backlit keyboard, large trackpad, a power button and two side grilles.But the screen is the star of the show. It’s a beautiful and crisp 13.9in 3:2-ratio screen squeezed into the frame with very slim bezels all round. It’s easily one of the best on the market and is quite large by modern laptop standards, housed in a smaller body typically associated with a 12in-screen laptop.The build of the machine is generally very good, with chamfered edges and a good fit and finish. There’s no give or flex in the keyboard, but there is a little in the rest of the deck and at the sides. The screen also has a little bit of give when squeezed when closed, or twisted when open.The MateBook X Pro is available in a couple of configurations, with a choice of 8th generation Core i5 and i7 processors, 8 or 16GB of RAM and 256 or 512GB of storage.Most of that is par for the course, but the Huawei machine also comes with a discrete Nvidia GeForce MX150 graphics card with 2GB of dedicated memory, which is rare for a machine of this size.The MX150 won’t set the gaming world alight, but it is a significant step up in performance for things like editing photos and video, or even powering a 4K display over your typical integrated graphics chips. It’s worth noting that the MX150 comes in two versions and the MateBook X Pro is fitted with the lower power 10W version, which is less powerful but more frugal than the 25W version that some other machines have fitted.Overall the MateBook X Pro was one of the best performing laptops I’ve ever used, easily handling anything and everything from video editing and advanced photo editing, to a bit of light gaming and Chrome with as many tabs as you can fit on one screen.The MateBook X Pro might be thin, but it still has a single full-sized USB 3.0 port along side a USB-C port and a Thunderbolt 3 port. Either of the USB-C-shaped ports can be used to charge the machine, while there’s a traditional headphones socket, but no card reader.Huawei is well known for its battery life in smartphones. Unfortunately, while the MateBook X Pro has reasonable battery life it isn’t anywhere near class-leading. It will get you through a work day without needing the charger, but if you want to watch a video on the commute home you’ll be out of luck.In my testing the MateBook X Pro lasted just over eight hours between charges while performing regular office duties, which includes lots of email, around 15 browser tabs open in Chrome, some photo editing, listening to music via Bluetooth headphones and lots of writing into lightweight text editors. Heavier things such as gaming affected the battery life quite a bit, but generally speaking most users will plug the laptop in to game or perform similarly demanding tasks for any extended period.Performance aside, the MateBook X Pro is a lovely machine to use. It’s whisper-quiet for the most part, with its fans only spinning under sustained heavy load, and its brilliant screen is matched by an equally excellent keyboard and trackpad. The keyboard looks like a MacBook Pro keyboard, but with real key travel. It’s a satisfying typing experience that is rarer than you might think on even expensive laptops.The keyboard also hides one of the most interesting tricks I’ve seen on a laptop in a while. The key between F6 and F7 is actually a pop-up webcam. Press it and it reveals a one-megapixel camera, which certainly has a tendency for the up-the-nose shot, but simply doesn’t get in the way during normal use. If you’re one of the vast majority of laptop users that barely ever turn on their webcam, this is a great compromise and it means no one is going to be able to hack your webcam and spy on you. There’s even a mute switch for the microphones, so no one will be able to listen to you either.The large trackpad is silky smooth and responsive, making it one of the best in the industry – at no stage did I end up zooming when I tried to scroll, which is something many PC laptops still struggle with.The power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner and will recognise you and log you into Windows when switching on with one momentary press, taking about eight seconds to power on and be useable. The MateBook X Pro has a Dolby Atmos sound system with four speakers built into it: two tweeters at the back and two bass speakers at the front, not that there’s any visual indication that they’re there.I was sceptical, but the four-speaker system actually works very well. It’s louder, clearer and has a smidgeon more bass than most of the best of the rest, although the audio is less direct than it might be on a machine with front-facing speakers such as Microsoft’s Surface Pro.They’re still laptop speakers, so don’t expect true room-filling sound or the quality of a set of external speakers, but they’re capable of being clearly heard while cooking and provide solid impromptu movie-watching experience.The Huawei MateBook X Pro will cost €1,499 with a Core i5, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, €1,699 for the same processor and RAM but 512GB of storage, or €1,899 with a Core i7, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage – as tested.A UK launch and pricing has yet to be determined.For comparison, For comparison, Dell’s XPS 13 with a comparable screen and 8th generation Core i5 starts at £1,399, Microsoft’s Surface Laptop starts at £979, the Surface Book 2 starts at £1,499 and Apple’s MacBook Pro starts at £1,249.Models with discrete graphics cost more, with Microsoft’s Surface Book 2 starting at £1,999 and Apple’s 15in MacBook Pro starting at £2,349.The MateBook X Pro shows that Huawei has what it takes to build a great laptop.The screen is brilliant and the tiny bezels mean you get a very good sized display in a pretty small body – 14in, it turns out, is a great size for both work and play on a thin and light laptop. It’s not a one-trick pony, either. It has one of the best keyboards on the market, an excellent, large trackpad and solid connectivity, it is a do-it-all machine in a beautiful case.It’s not perfect, though. There’s give in the aluminium where I don’t think there should be, and the battery life is good but not class-leading. But on the whole Huawei has created something quite special here.Pros: beautiful screen, tiny bezels, slim, compact, excellent keyboard, great trackpad, USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, regular USB port, fingerprint scanner, discrete GPU, pop-up webcam, Dolby Atmos speakers that are goodCons: battery life not class-leading, no SD card slot, webcam has an up-nose angle, only two USB-C ports of which one has to charge the machine"},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

We all saw it. I wanted to keep it but then I thought, no, it’s like keeping a radioactive thing,” he said. Truqui, who is based in Switzerland, served as an assistant to the late Father Gabriele Amorth, a famous exorcist who claimed to have performed more than 100,000 exorcisms. Truqui is heading to Rome this month to teach a new course on exorcism for priests who want to learn the ancient rite, which he says is rooted in the Gospels.“Christ was the first exorcist,” says Truqui. “The power of casting out demons was one of the signs that Christianity was a true religion.”These days, most faithful Catholics believe the idea of expelling demons is antiquated. While Pope Francis has spent more time talking about the devil than other modern popes – and reportedly once performed an impromptu exorcism – he has only rarely discussed the ritual.Yet demand for exorcism is on the rise, Truqui says, as more bishops around the world, who were once sceptical about the practice, have come to see it as a possible solution to their parishioners’ problems, especially in cases where they believe modern medicine and psychiatry have failed.But how does a practice that is synonymous with a horror movie, and which is steeped in the supernatural, have a place in the modern church, even as it condemns people who dabble in so-called “black magic”?While exorcism has been criticised for stigmatising and possibly harming iniduals who suffer from mental illnesses or physical ailments that might be difficult to diagnose, and despite some high profile cases of abuse by exorcists, Truqui claims the “patients” he sees find peace in the process.“At the end of the exorcism, there is always relief,” he says.His subjects, he says, have problems that cannot be explained in normal medical terms. One, who he believes may have been cursed by her mother-in-law, feels an almost constant sensation of daggers entering her legs, knitting needles in her arms, and a clenched hand at her chin. Another was so obsessed by self-gratification that he masturbated 40 times a day. “Normally speaking it is humanly impossible … so that is a satanic thing,” says Truqui.These people, he claims, are capable of feats of superhuman strength. Sometimes their voice changes and they growl or speak in tongues. He claims to have witnessed people with vexations who can suddenly speak in Hebrew or Aramaic even though they have never studied the languages. Some are obsessive and show knowledge of what Truqui calls “secret things”, like what a person who is not present is doing or wearing, and they are sometimes overwhelmed by feelings of discomfort when they are in places of worship.“Most of the time, the people who see me are victims,” he says.Truqui also spoke at length about Satan, who he described as a pragmatic foe. “The devil tempts the holy man in his holiness and the sinner in his sin,” he says.While he is at pains to point out that he does not believe Pope Francis is possessed or vexed by the devil, he says that the devil would know that Francis would not be tempted by lust for a woman. Instead, he would prey on Francis’s sympathy for the poor, and tempt him to ignore the affluent.The process of exorcism itself, he says, is relatively boring, compared with the Hollywood version: an exorcist puts his hand on a person’s back or head, and begins by reciting the Lord’s Prayer. A vexed or possessed person, Truqui says, might then start speaking for the devil."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34bd8f52eed5f4293e09eded326b26bda3425686/0_0_4354_2613/master/4354.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=af5ce929ae2748ab1693ef8a72c31c81 1240w","title":"iranian rial all time low us dollars tehran","story":"Bureaux de change close down to avoid queues after Tehran tries to stabilise exchange rateIran’s government is scrambling to contain a currency crisis after the rial hit an all-time low, prompting panic-buying of hard-to-find dollars amid political uncertainty. The Iranian currency has been steadily losing its value against the dollar since the 1979 Islamic revolution, when one dollar bought 70 rials. This week, one dollar was exchanged for up to 60,000 rials in central Tehran, as people sceptical of the country’s economic performance and uncertain about its future political stability rushed to get hold of more-stable foreign tender. President Hassan Rouhani initially succeeded in controlling currency fluctuations inherited from his predecessor. While one dollar bought 36,000 rials in 2013, when he was first elected, it was the equivalent to 40,000 rials in April last year and 60,000 rials on Monday.Vice-president Eshaq Jahangiri said the government would impose a unified rate of 42,000 rials for a dollar. On Tuesday, there were no signs that the policy was being successfully implemented as many currency exchanges in Tehran closed their shops to avoid long queues. Others did not sell.The central bank, whose governor general was summoned to speak behind a turbulent session of the Iranian parliament on Tuesday, also limited the amount of foreign currency people that were allowed to keep in cash to €10,000 (£8,700) or equivalent. The crisis comes three months after protests over economic grievances that soon took on a political dimension and spread to up to 80 cities, taking politicians by surprise. In May, Donald Trump faces a deadline to either sign a presidential waiver on sanctions on Iran, or withdraw the US from the 2015 nuclear accord. The latter would have severe consequences for Iran as it the nuclear-related sanctions that were lifted as part of the agreement may be restored. Saeed Laylaz, a prominent Tehran-based economist close to the Rouhani team, said both internal and external political reasons were driving the currency devaluation. Some officials have blamed Iran’s regional rivals, including US-backed Saudi Arabia and the UAE, for limiting Tehran’s access to dollars.Khajehpour said the currency nosee was not down to the country’s economic performance, but could have an impact on it. “We’re in a period of transition both in terms of relationship between the government and the deep state but also space that it has provided for corrupt practices. We’re in a very delicate phase in political relationships depending on what the outcome is – Rouhani can either be weakened or strengthened,” he said. “If this so-called unification of exchange rate is implemented successfully, if they manage to unify the exchange rate and pull through and provide enough liquidity to the market, then to keep this rate or around this rate, it will be a real achievement.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30acd21b524ed5f309b8e318968cc61e6f821c96/0_136_2293_1376/master/2293.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c95fe6280369126ca52f3b1ef12c273a 1240w","title":"myanmar judge rules reuters reporters must stand trial over report of rohingya massacre","story":"Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo to be tried over report on atrocity the army admits took placeTwo Reuters journalists arrested while investigating a massacre of Rohingya Muslims will face trial in Myanmar after a court rejected a motion to drop the case against them.Reporters Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, were detained in December and accused of violating the country’s Official Secrets Act for possessing material relating to security operations in Rakhine state that was handed to them by the police.Myanmar has faced global condemnation and accusations of extrajudicial killings, ethnic cleansing and genocide as some 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled Rakhine for Bangladesh following a military crackdown on insurgents. The Rohingya are Muslims who live in majority-Buddhist Myanmar. They are often described as the world\u0027s most persecuted minority.\u0026nbspNearly all of Myanmar\u0027s 1.1 million Rohingya live in the western coastal state of Rakhine. The government does not recognise them as citizens, effectively rendering them stateless.Extremist nationalist movements insist the group are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, although the Rohingya say they are native to Rakhine state.Rights groups accuse Burmese authorities of ethnic cleansing, systematically forcing Rohingya from the country through violence and persecution, a charge the government has denied.The government rejects the allegations and says it was defending itself against attacks from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army that took place in August last year.The two reporters have been held in Yangon’s Insein prison since their arrest while facing hearings to determine whether the case will go to trial, with 17 out of 25 witnesses having given testimony.Their lawyers asked the court to dismiss the case last week, citing in part troubling discrepancies in witness statements, but the motion was swiftly rejected in a Yangon courtroom packed with supporters, family and media.“The court decided that the proposal from the defendants’ lawyer to release the defendants before all the witnesses were cross-examined has been rejected,” judge Ye Lwin said.The pair had been investigating a massacre of 10 Rohingya men on 2 September in the Rakhine village of Inn Din that was carried out by security forces and local villagers.The military admitted that the atrocity took place and Reuters later published the story while the reporters were in prison.In a rare punishment in a country where the military has long operated with impunity, seven soldiers were sentenced to jail with hard labour for their part in the killings on Tuesday.The army has claimed the Rohingya men were terrorists, but has not presented any evidence to back up the claim. Wa Lone referred to the sentencing of the soldiers as he was being directed back into the police van following the hearing.“Those who killed people in the mass killing were given a sentence of 10 years. We were simply trying to find out the news and report this and we are facing a trial that could result in us going to prison for 14 years,” he said.One of his lawyers Than Zaw Aung also compared the cases.“My question is why are the journalists still in detention in prison if their report is true.” The case against the journalists has proceeded despite international calls for their release. Reuters announced last month that that prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney had joined the legal team.Reuters president, Stephen J Adler, said in a statement that the company was deeply disappointed with the court’s decision.“We believe that there are solid grounds for the court to dismiss this matter and to release our journalists. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were reporting on issues in Myanmar in an independent and impartial way,” he said. “They have not violated any laws in the course of their newsgathering and were simply doing their jobs.”Family members of the reporters were in tears after the ruling, but Wa Lone, who turned 32 on Wednesday and was brought cake by his friends, still expressed optimism.“I believe in democracy. I also believe that one day we will be released because of freedom of expression,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4aff7ce1b81157c03caec0f549e180bde1d301bc/0_0_5456_3273/master/5456.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1c119d88cff786b9d0ed55b9fccb2ded 1240w","title":"new zealands human rights tribunal breaching human rights due to delays","story":"Tribunal’s chairman says system is on the brink of collapse and failing the most vulnerable because of an increase in cases The New Zealand human rights review tribunal is in crisis and on the brink of collapse because of an “exponential increase” in cases, according to a revealing letter from its chairman, who says he is overstretched and failing some of New Zealand’s most vulnerable people.Documents obtained by the New Zealand Herald include a letter from the tribunal chairman, Roger Haines, QC, to the incoming minister of justice, Andrew Little, saying the tribunal was experiencing massive delays hearing cases, had a backlog that would take five years to clear, and people’s human rights were at risk as they experienced long waits for their day in court.“The delays in the tribunal are reaching the point where the system is in danger of falling into disrepute if not collapsing,” Haines wrote.“Access to justice is being denied to almost all. For a tribunal charged with protecting human rights the situation is ironic, to say the least.”In a statement the ministry of justice said the government was reviewing how to rectify the situation, and the extreme load of responsibility on Haines who, by law, had to be a part of every panel that heard a case. The human rights review tribunal investigates alleged breaches of the human rights act, the privacy act and the health and disability act, largely relating to discrimination. In 2012-2013 the tribunal heard 36 cases, but by 2016-2017 this figure had leapt to 127. At the current rate, cases were taking 22 to 28 months from filing a complaint to first hearing, a delay Little said was not good enough. A human rights lawyer and Greens MP, Golriz Ghahraman, said the lengthy waiting time at the tribunal was a breach of human rights. “Having your case heard expediently is a human right, access to justice includes timely access to justice,” Ghahraman said.Little said there were likely to be provisions in the May budget to allow the court to function better, which may include additional employees, as well as planning for urgent legislative change before the end of the year that would allow deputies to chair hearings so the workload could be spread.“We certainly inherited this problem,” Little said. “The number of applications to the human rights review tribunal has increased quite significantly with more privacy complaints than ever before, and the resources have not been increased to allow them to do their job.”The opposition’s justice minister declined to comment.

Both sides rejected the other’s proposals to set up UN-led inquiries into the alleged attack, leaving some sort of military response against the Assad regime more likely. Russia said the allies were using the issue as a pretext to attack Syria, its longstanding Middle East ally to which it has lent extensive military support during the seven-year civil war. The US president, Donald Trump, who has cancelled a trip to Peru this weekend, has promised a “major decision”. In London, Theresa May called her national security council to discuss the crisis sparked by the attack on 7 April on the rebel-held town of Douma which left 45 people dead. ‘Online arms race’ – Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and chief executive of Facebook, has vowed to ensure that no one messes with the elections around the world this year and warned of an online propaganda “arms race” with Russia during five hours of interrogation by US Congress members. He told one senator that he could not guarantee that some of the images allegedly spread on Facebook by Russian operatives during the US presidential election would not reappear. “This is going to be an ongoing conflict,” he said. Despite the billionaire’s obvious discomfort at the hearings, where he felt obliged to ditch his trademark T-shirt and jeans for a business suit and tie, his comments nevertheless gave what our Washington correspondent David Smith calls an “insight into the unnerving reach and influence of Facebook in numerous democratic societies”. And our Silicon Valley expert, Julia Carrie Wong, writes that the decision by two senators to livestream the hearings on Facebook only underlined Zuckerberg’s influence. He’s on again later today.His testimony comes after Facebook admitted that the personal data of 87 million users was harvested by Cambridge Analytica without permission. Both companies – with two others – face a class action after lawyers in the US and UK filed a lawsuit yesterday. It claims on behalf of one million UK users and 70 million US users that the firms took private information from the social media network to develop “political propaganda campaigns” in the UK and the US.Centre of attention – Britain’s potential new centrist political party has links to Tony Blair and his son, Euan, the Guardian has learned. As the Observer revealed on Sunday, LoveFilm’s founder, Simon Franks, has set up a company as a vehicle to get the party started. Sources have told our political team that one person who was approached to join was told that Euan Blair – who runs a start-up company – was on the board and that Blair senior had advised on identifying donors. Euan Blair did not respond for comment and a spokesperson for his father denied any involvement.Fox hunt – Documents and computer records have reportedly been seized from the London offices of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox in raids by European commission officials. A spokesman for the commission confirmed that a series of “unannounced inspections” had taken place at the offices of unnamed companies in several EU countries on Tuesday. They are investigating a potential abuse of Fox’s dominant position in the broadcasting of major sports events amid concerns of the regulators in Brussels that the entertainment conglomerate “may have violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices”.The lower deck solution – Airbus says it is planning to introduce sleeping compartments in the cargo holds of its wide-bodied A330 passenger aircraft. The jet manufacturer says it has received positive feedback about the idea from airlines and it raises the prospect that those of us who can’t afford business or first-class travel might finally be able to get a decent sleep on a long-haul flight. However, Airbus’s partner, Zodiac Aerospace, doesn’t really sell the idea very appealingly, saying the scheme reaffirms its expertise in “lower-deck solutions”.OK, slight break with morning briefing tradition here but what better point in the day to highlight a piece from our food team about healthy breakfasts. Admittedly you might not have time to start dry toasting oats and almonds right now – as one recipe demands – so it might be one to put on the back-burner for the weekend. Anyway, these dishes are really healthy, so another word of warning: if you’re hoping that the article will somehow find a way to say that bacon and eggs are healthy, you’re going to be disappointed. That said, the “overnight oats with blueberry, vanilla and chia” sounds tasty even though it might just be a posh way of soaking your porridge overnight. The 10-minute almond granola has also got the briefing team interested. Slightly more exotic offerings – and more time-consuming ones – include coconut brown rice porridge with mango and lime, and ashura cereal with yoghurt and fruit.Pep Guardiola blamed decisions that went against Manchester City in both legs of the Champions League quarter-final as they were knocked out by Liverpool 5-1 on aggregate at the Etihad stadium. Guardiola’s half-time bust-up helped bring City’s house of cards crashing down as they imploded in self-immolating fury, writes Barney Ronay. After last night’s other quarter-final, Roma’s captain, Daniele De Rossi, praised the coach, Eusebio Di Francesco, after his side completed a remarkable comeback against Barcelona to reach the last four. Leicester’s Ben Youngs says he is delighted to have avoided knee surgery and to be fit for a comeback in Saturday’s game against Northampton. “It definitely feels like I dodged a bullet,” he tells Gerard Meagher. And day seven of the Commonwealth Games is under way on Australia’s Gold Coast, with another 15 medals up for grabs.Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, has warned of “darker clouds looming” for the global economy amid trade tensions between the US and China. She says the current system was “in danger of being torn apart”. The markets are a little bit less apocalyptic, with mildest falls in Japan and Australia overnight, but Hong Kong is still feeling positive this morning. The pound is sitting at $1.418 and €1.146.The Mail splashes with a story about energy bills under the headline “Minister slams greed of British Gas”. It also features the stramash about a floral tribute left by the family of the intruder stabbed to death in London last week being torn down. Other papers led on this. “Shameless” says the Mirror, while the Metro calls it the “The war of the posies”.The Guardian leads with the class action against Facebook, alongside the latest on Syria. The Times leads with a domestic take on the crisis saying “May resists calls to join US action against Syria”, but the Telegraph says “May stands behind Trump”.

The march of history towards economic liberalisation was irreversible, he said at another point, restating China’s commitment to free trade.Then he slipped in a Chinese proverb: “Heaven has its own law and those who embrace it will prosper.” The saying, meant to celebrate China’s unique blend of socialism and a market-driven economy, contained another message: that China would continue to play by its own rules.Xi’s remarks – his first public comments since Beijing and Washington began sparring over tariffs – at first appeared conciliatory. He pledged to further open up China’s financial services sector, lower tariffs on car imports, encourage other imports and better protect intellectual property – the latter issue being one of the key grievances of Donald Trump’s White House.But US investors and businesses have been hearing most of these promises for at least the past two years. Some of the pledges will have minimal impact. For instance, lowering import duties on cars will benefit relatively few US companies, most of which already produce and ship their vehicles from within China. Xi also promised to open up China’s shipbuilding and manufacturing sectors, though Andrew Collier, the managing director of Orient Capital Research, noted that manufacturing had been relatively accessible to foreign investors since China joined the World Trade Organisation in 2001. “Xi delivered a masterful, carefully framed, conciliatory response to Trump,” Collier said.The US president said on Tuesday after Xi’s speech that he was “very thankful” for the Chinese leader’s pledges on tariffs and the car industry. “We will make great progress together!” he tweeted.The US has threatened to impose tariffs on as much as $150bn (£105bn) of Chinese imports in response to what it says are unfair Chinese trade policies that protect domestic markets while forcing foreign companies to hand over their technology and intellectual property. China has responded with its own list of US goods it could levy, including soya beans, aircraft and other major US exports, many of which come from battleground states influential in upcoming midterm elections.“China seems to have gotten a lot of mileage from Xi’s rote statements and minor concessions that Trump has turned around and spun as evidence of his deal-making prowess,” said Eswar Prasad, a senior professor on trade policy at Cornell University in the US and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.Xi’s speech, which had been expected to set out bold reforms, was instead similar to his remarks in Davos last year. In that speech he framed China as the world’s new champion of free trade in an implicit rebuke to Trump. On Tuesday Xi again emphasised China’s commitment to economic openness. “China’s cheek is something to behold given that they are building a new international order alongside the one they pledged to leave undisturbed,” wrote Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. One of China’s key industrial policies is aimed at replacing foreign technology with domestically made components and establishing Chinese companies as global champions. Much of the White House’s tariffs target the policy, known as Made in China 2020.Xi’s comments, while offering little, may still be enough to tamp down escalating rhetoric. Some of the measures Xi named appear to be moving forward, which could also help. The People’s Bank of China said on Wednesday that previously announced moves to put foreign companies on an equal footing with domestic rivals in the financial services sector would be implemented by the end of the year.“China is laying a preliminary foundation to talk with the US,” said Pang Zhongying, a Beijing-based international relations expert. “I think the time is gradually coming for China and the US to negotiate.”Additional reporting by Wang Xueying "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb16424df71d0782e4c88c0a2c0ff3d65460dddb/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=860\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=36539f24a45ad6f9351ac39d614c18c1 1720w","title":"good news at last the world isnt as horrific as you think","story":"Training yourself how to put the news into perspective – practising ‘factfulness’ – will change your outlook for the betterThings are bad, and it feels like they are getting worse, right? War, violence, natural disasters, corruption. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer and we will soon run out of resources unless something drastic is done. That’s the picture most people in the west see in the media and carry around in their heads.I call it the overdramatic worldview. It’s stressful and misleading. In fact, the vast majority of the world’s population live somewhere in the middle of the income scale. Perhaps they are not what we think of as middle class, but they are not living in extreme poverty. Their girls go to school, their children get vaccinated. Perhaps not on every single measure, or every single year, but step by step, year by year, the world is improving. In the past two centuries, life expectancy has more than doubled. Although the world faces huge challenges, we have made tremendous progress.The overdramatic worldview draws people to the most negative answers. It is not caused simply by out-of-date knowledge. My experience, over decades of lecturing and testing, has finally brought me to see that the overdramatic worldview comes from the very way our brains work. The brain is a product of millions of years of evolution, and we are hard-wired with instincts that helped our ancestors to survive in small groups of hunters and gatherers. We crave sugar and fat, which used to be life-saving sources of energy when food was scarce. But today these cravings make obesity one of the biggest global health problems. In the same way, we are interested in gossip and dramatic stories, which used to be the only source of news and useful information. This craving for drama causes misconceptions and helps create an overdramatic worldview.We still need these dramatic instincts to give meaning to our world. If we sifted every input and analysed every decision rationally, a normal life would be impossible. Just as we should not cut out all sugar and fat, we should not ask a surgeon to remove the parts of our brain that deal with emotions. But we need to learn to control our drama intake.Our instinct to notice the bad more than the good is related to three things: the misremembering of the past selective reporting by journalists and activists and the feeling that as long as things are bad, it’s heartless to say they are getting better. For centuries, older people have romanticised their youths and insisted that things ain’t what they used to be. Well, that’s true. Most things used to be worse. This tendency to misremember is compounded by the never-ending negative news from across the world.Stories about gradual improvements rarely make the front page even when they occur on a dramatic scale and affect millions of people. And thanks to increasing press freedom and improving technology, we hear about more disasters than ever before. This improved reporting is itself a sign of human progress, but it creates the impression of the exact opposite. At the same time, activists and lobbyists manage to make every dip in an improving trend appear to be the end of the world, scaring us with alarmist exaggerations and prophecies. In the United States, the violent crime rate has been falling since 1990. But each time something horrific or shocking happened – pretty much every year – a crisis was reported. The majority of people believe that violent crime is getting worse.My guess is you feel that me saying that the world is getting better is like me telling you that everything is fine, and that feels ridiculous. I agree. Everything is not fine. We should still be very concerned. As long as there are plane crashes, preventable child deaths, endangered species, climate change sceptics, male chauvinists, crazy dictators, toxic waste, journalists in prison, and girls not getting an education, we cannot relax. But it is just as ridiculous to look away from the progress that has been made. The consequent loss of hope can be devastating. When people wrongly believe that nothing is improving, they may lose confidence in measures that actually work.How can we help our brains to realise that things are getting better? Think of the world as a very sick premature baby in an incubator. After a week, she is improving, but she has to stay in the incubator because her health is still critical. Does it make sense to say that the infant’s situation is improving? Yes. Does it make sense to say it is bad? Yes, absolutely. Does saying “things are improving” imply that everything is fine, and we should all not worry? Not at all: it’s both bad and better. That is how we must think about the current state of the world.Remember that the media and activists rely on drama to grab your attention that negative stories are more dramatic than positive ones and how simple it is to construct a story of crisis from a temporary dip pulled out of its context of a long-term improvement. When you hear about something terrible, calm yourself by asking: if there had been a positive improvement, would I have heard about that? Even if there had been hundreds of larger improvements, would I have heard?This is “factfulness”: understanding as a source of mental peace. Like a healthy diet and regular exercise, it can and should become part of people’s daily lives. Start to practise it, and you will make better decisions, stay alert to real dangers and possibilities, and avoid being constantly stressed about the wrong things.• Hans Rosling was a Swedish physician, academic and statistician, who died in 2017.

Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty ImagesUK Labour politician Barry Gardiner has insisted he “absolutely” does not believe the Good Friday Agreement is outdated and said he was “deeply sorry” that remarks he made about the deal had led to a “misunderstanding”.Gardiner, Britain’s shadow international trade secretary, told a conference in Brussels last month that the Irish Government was playing up the issue of the Border in Brexit negotiations for economic reasons and described the Good Friday Agreement as a “shibboleth”.In a recording of his remarks, which The Irish Times has heard, he said:“I think we must also recognise that there are real economic reasons why people have played up the issue of the Irish border and the need to have the shibboleth of the Good Friday agreement. And that is because it is hugely in the Republic of Ireland’s economic interest to make sure that there is no tariff and no external border there”.In a statement released on Tuesday, Mr Gardiner apologised for the remarks, saying: “The Good Friday Agreement is a vital and essential part of the relationship between the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and has been central to the two decades of peace it has brought about.“Labour is completely committed to the agreement and opposed to any return of a hard border between North and South.“We are committed to negotiating a new customs union between the UK and Ireland as part of a final Brexit settlement, which would play a key role in ensuring there is no hard border.“I am deeply sorry that my informal remarks in a meeting last month have led to misunderstanding on that point — in particular, that my use of the word ‘shibboleth’ in its sense of ‘pass word’ or ‘test of membership’ gave the impression that I thought the Good Friday Agreement was in any way outdated or unimportant.

Photograph:  Louisa GouliamakiAFPGetty Given that Greece had first-hand experience of a fascist government as recently as 1967-1974, and that today it has a neo-Nazi party lying third in the opinion polls, the need for a democratic profile is all the more evident.Following the attempted coup in Turkey in July 2016 (which has yet to be explained), eight members of the Turkish military arrived in Greece, claiming political asylum. Turkey has persistently argued for their extradition but has provided no prima facie evidence of their involvement in the alleged coup. Last month, Turkey renewed its application to the Greek courts, with charges against the soldiers of terrorism and attempted murder.The Greek courts, for their part, have consistently refused to extradite the soldiers on the grounds that they would not receive a fair trial. This reached its peak last month when the appeals court stated that “If they are extradited they will be subjected to torture, humiliation and degradation.” Turkey in return has accused Greece of harbouring terrorism.The escalating row between Greece and Turkey concerns not only human rights but a raft of other issues such as borders, mineral exploitation and the treatment of refugees. The refugee situation will become a seasonal problem as spring and summer approach, making the dangerous crossing from Turkey to Greece slightly less dangerous, and it is exacerbated by Turkey’s threat to rescind its agreement with the EU to restrain Syrian and other refugees from making the crossing to Greece.The human rights issues in all these cases echo the recent situation regarding the Irish courts and the requested extradition of a Polish citizen. But more is at stake than the inidual fates of the Turks and the Pole. Ireland’s problems with Poland are of course an internal EU matter, but this and the Greek-Turkish problem have something in common: for 45 years, Europe was split east-west by the Soviet hegemony, but today there are no geographical borders to the conflict between populism and elitism.The Greek government is an uneasy alliance between the far-left and the far-right. The Italian election threatened a similar result. It’s increasingly difficult to find stability in Europe as a whole and it’s getting easier – perhaps too easy – to become a Eurosceptic.While the majority (60 per cent) of Greeks still favour European membership, the question is being asked: what exactly does the EU represent in terms of policies and the way they affect ordinary people? Is it inclusive of cultures, religions, skin colours? Is it aligned unreservedly to Nato? Is it compassionate?There are EU member states which do not, at present, conform to the ideals and principles on which the European concept was established. For example the Czech Republic, Denmark, Holland and Austria exhibit anti-people profiles in respect of refugees and asylum seekers – issues on which Greece’s positive record is demonstrable.But an editorial in Kathimerini (Greece’s leading daily) recently pointed to several factors which show Greece as a third-world country: cooked-up charges of corruption against former government ministers and prime ministers kowtowing to the demands of imprisoned terrorists and the alleged association of the governing party with a gun-toting Greek-Russian billionaire. Yanis Palaiologos, author of an expose of Greece’s bureaucratic shortcomings, pointed out last month that the government, “while it may be in office, is still not in power”. This is, in effect, negative government.Syriza came to power because citizens had exhausted their tolerance for the two-party system and the paralysis in the public service. But the inevitable submission to force majeure from the EU, the International Monetary Fund and domestic vested interests disabled the impetus for change.Like many Europeans, Greeks are in a state of disenchantment, with the absence of political leadership that might alleviate the motor neurone disease of their national existence.The Greek situation amounts to an inexperienced and outclassed government split on ideological lines, incapable of honouring its pre-election promises, and still uncertain whether it can exit its third bailout with any dignity or assurance.Greek journalists call consistently for a “new narrative” – a route map to a future that is credible and acceptable. But we are discovering that the self-doubts of Greeks may be shared with others in Europe and that the need for a new narrative is common to all. The current disagreements between centre and periphery in fact call into question whether there is any cohesive factor within the EU shared by all its citizens.The negative government in Greece seems to be symptomatic of an European implosion. President Michael D Higgins’s recent call, while in Athens, for the smaller states to enter the European conversation depends on their having something to say that is sensible and ethically agreeable.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/03/30/TELEMMGLPICT000159114527_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"british cheese now status symbol us japan","story":"British cheese makers are rapidly expanding to cope with the demand as traditional cheeses like Stilton and Red Leicester are increasingly being recognized as a status symbol abroadBritish cheese exports are booming in a boost for the UK economy, thanks to a growing demand for smelly cheeseboards in US and Japan.British cheese makers are rapidly expanding to cope with the demand as traditional cheeses like Stilton and Red Leicester are increasingly being recognized as a status symbol abroad, experts have said. Cheese producers now send around a third of their product abroad, with January 2018 seeing a 23 per cent increase in UK cheese exports compared with January of 2017, data from Dairy UK shows.English Blue Stilton cheese for sale at Broadway Market, HackneyFor example a £25m pound expansion is underway at a historic dairy in Leicestershire to meet a surge in demand for cheese from overseas. Long Clawson Dairy makes Stilton and other cheeses, and sends around 20 per cent of its products to 40 countries, including the US, Canada, China and Australia.NFU Dairy Board Chairman Michael Oakes, said cheese exports out of the UK had doubled in recent years amid a growing demand for upmarket cheeses displaying the Union jack and red tractor logo. \u0026quotThere is a growing trend for cheeseboards within fine dining experiences, particularly in the US and Japan. A cheese course is typically enjoyed with wine and is very much a luxury experience involving high quality, strong tasting cheeses. \u0026quotDiners very much want to see the traditional cheese names like Stilton and red Leicester, and they want to see the Union Jack and Red tractor logos. Its a similar effect as Belgian or Swiss chocolate over here, it has that air of luxury, it is a status symbol.

However, it turned out to be a determined seal, which swam 50 miles through Britain’s river network from the North Sea in pursuit of fish.The long-distance swimmer had most likely become lost and disorientated after chasing a salmon or sea trout upstream, according to experts.The seal is thought to have swum through York on its way to the Dales, in pursuit of fresh Spring salmon.Seals are mammals which usually prefer a salt water marine environment, as this is where most of the fish they can eat are found, but can also swim in fresh water, and do this when they chase their food sources up rivers.Anthony Hurd, the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust’s Living Seas Centre Manager in Flamborough, said it is not rare for seals to travel upstream in search of food, but that it is “surprising” the animal was spotted so far inland. It is thought by the Trust that the animal became lost while on its journey to catch fish.Bex Lynam, The Trust’s North Sea Marine Advocacy Officer, told The Telegraph: “Seals are known to use a number of the UK’s rivers and on occasions will swim upriver for quite some distance. “It’s thought that they are simply following their food source which would include salmon or sea trout making their way up the river at particular times of the year. “They may then become disorientated, especially younger seals, which is why they have been reported found in fields and similar unusual locations, having hauled themselves out of the river and on to dry land.”Seals are mammals which usually prefer a salt water marine environment, as this is where most of the fish they can eat are found, but can also swim in fresh water, and do this when they chase their food sources up rivers.Walkers were stunned to see the large grey male seal near Thirsk, at a spot near Topcliffe Weir.He was pictured by amateur photographer Karen Hargreave, from the area, who said she had never seen anything like it before.She said: \u0026quotSome friends of ours went for a walk, and saw something large in the river. \u0026quotOn closer inspection they realised it was a seal and as I am interested in wildlife they messaged me. \u0026quotApparently the seal had turned up last Thursday morning. Locals from the mill spoke to various experts, some I think may have visited the site, and confirmed it was a large healthy male. \u0026quotHe had probably swum up from the Humber estuary following salmon. \u0026quotWhen I saw the message, I rang my friend as I couldn\u0027t quite believe it. She confirmed the sighting .but also said that it had since disappeared. \u0026quotMy husband and I decided to try our luck on Friday morning, and sure enough he was still there,  out on the bank. He was an amazing sight.\u0026quotThe seal was seen swimming in a wierHe was also spotted by walker Tony Wilson, 48, who thought the animal was a sheep.Mr Wilson said: \u0026quotIt looked so bizarre. At first I thought it was a sheep but as I got closer I saw he was a great big grey seal. I couldn\u0027t figure out how he\u0027d arrived there but speaking to people in the village later it seems he\u0027d swam all the way from the sea up the river.\u0026quotSea life experts were impressed by the \u0026quotincredible\u0026quot journey the seal made. Head Curator at Sea Life Manchester, Alan Kwan told The Telegraph: \u0026quotIt\u0027s true what they say, there\u0027s no such thing as a free dinner, even in the animal world! It\u0027s likely the seal hankered after a particularly dishy fish - so much so that the seal gave chase for 50 miles! Seals are incredible animals, the transition from sea to freshwater wouldn\u0027t have bothered him at all.\u0026quot Yulia Skripal reportedly turns down help from the Russians despite claim she was \u0026#39abducted\u0026#39Royal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsRoyal wedding guest list: Theresa May and Donald Trump are not invitedChild stabbings rise by 63pc amid \u0026#39disturbing\u0026#39 trend of younger knife crime victimsCar thieves target middle-class areas, as police warn drivers to invest in a steering wheel lockTheresa May stands behind Donald Trump on Syria strikes, as Russia warns against \u0026#39illegal\u0026#39 intervention Comment: It’s all too easy to take a staple like Front Row for grantedPaedophile hunters ignore police pleas and bring 150 offenders to justiceScotland\u0026#39s high streets lose shops at highest rate in BritainDavid Davis \u0026#39clashes with Brexit negotiating team over sealing trade deal by autumn\u0026#39Relatives of Japanese abducted by North Korea urge US to raise issue in Trump-Kim summitTen-day hospital stay is enough to make pensioners age 10 years, new NHS medical chief warns \u0026#39I\u0026#39m really sorry\u0026#39: Mark Zuckerberg has been apologising for privacy lapses since before Facebook even beganMark Zuckerberg\u0026#39s testimony to Congress: Facebook boss admits company working with Mueller\u0026#39s Russia probeRobbers pick fight with wheelchair-bound man who turned out to be a 6ft 7in tall Afghanistan veteranNHS returns to china cups and saucers in war on disposable cupsTheresa May among world\u0026#39s most admired women for first time... but she is still below Taylor Swift and the Queen Protests banned outside abortion clinic in landmark vote by London council We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "}]
