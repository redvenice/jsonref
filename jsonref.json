Green has put a plan in place for the company to pay in £50m a year to make good the shortfall, but it remains a millstone for him and any potential purchaser.           In 2015 Green was embroiled in the BHS fiasco which saw him sell BHS to Dominic Chappell, who had been declared bankrupt three timesThe CVA plans, first reported by Sky News, could still be delayed or halted depending on talks with stakeholders.The insolvency mechanism has been used by a slew of major retailers over the past year, frequently resulting in the closure of some stores and resulting job losses.The group could also use the process to seek a change to rent terms from landlords, including substantial reductions.The formal talks with landlords are expected to begin in the next few weeks while the restructuring process could be formally launched as early as next month.\u0027It should have been me\u0027: Male friend of Louis Tomlinson\u0027s...Pictured: Former science teacher, 36, who drowned her...Share this articleAny proposal would require the approval of creditors including landlords and the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) at a vote.The Pensions Regulator (TPR), the UK\u0027s regulator for workplace pension schemes, confirmed to Press Association that it is aware of the situation.A spokesman for TPR said: \u0027We are in close discussions with the trustees of the pension scheme.

It took a long-running surveillance operation to establish he was the missing member of the gang  A long-running police investigation found Seed was the mystery gang member called \u0027Basil\u0027Seed had evaded capture by leaving few traces of his existence. He paid no tax, claimed no benefits and rarely used a bank account. A source told MailOnline: \u0027He was under surveillance the whole time. The problem initially was that he didn\u0027t have the goods and this separation between thief and the gems went on for a long time.\u0027To get the best chance of conviction and recovering the jewellery, police had to wait and wait.\u0027Detectives were confident that as time passed he would be have to be reunited with the jewels.

He originally paid £13 a week in rent but now pays £105.          Despite having piles of stolen jewellery, Seed continued to live in a council flat in this block          Police raided the modest property after a three-year probe to find out who \u0027Basil\u0027 wasSeed told jurors: \u0027I was unemployed for a while and then I started fixing TVs and videos - just fixing problems if anyone had a problem with a computer. I have always been good with computers.\u0027Before the PC came out you had to go and build your own computer. I have written a few programmes. I started writing software when I was at university.\u0027I did not get into jewellery until about the mid-90s. It is purely a thing for making money I have never had much interest in it or liking for it.\u0027He spent most of his adult life selling jewellery in the \u0027black\u0027 economy but also tinkered with electronic gadgetry including mobile phone signal blockers.Seed claimed he met fellow Hatton Garden gang members Reader, Kenny Collins and Jones while working in Hatton Garden.Covert recordings showed other members of the gang didn\u0027t understand Seed\u0027s technology, with Danny Jones overheard saying: \u0027He can baffle me with b******t.\u0027His frugal lifestyle was the subject of mockery by fellow gang members who said his portion of the takings would see him through for the rest of his life because he lived in the cheapest \u0027gaffs\u0027.          Inside, officers found a mess of old electrical equipment and jewellery in a wardrobe          Flying Squad officers uncovered electrical equipment from the electronics geek\u0027s flatA photograph of his balcony showed a clutter of discarded objects amongst which was a buzzer with a speaker attached he had developed to frighten pigeons away.Seed accepted he was a hoarder and led a chaotic life which involved weekly bouts of heavy drinking.He said he could have acquired a BT workman\u0027s jacket - which prosecutors claimed was used to gain access to the sites before the raids from a drinking companion who left it at his flat.Seed\u0027s biophysicist father John taught himself to degree level before taking a PhD at Christ Church, Cambridge but little else emerged about his family during the trial.He has a brother and sister who live in Cambridge he is said to have strong ties with.Seed likes to holiday, staying in a quiet village in Portugal at least once a year, flying with budget airlines out of season when its cheaper and the weather is still good.Eloquent and witty, he tried to charm the jury with his wit while maintaining he had nothing to do with the raids.His barrister Richard Sutton, QC, even suggested Basil could be a foreign criminal with link to a £86m diamond vault heist in Antwerp in 2003.But the jury found Seed and Basil are one of the same.   How \u0027diamond wheezers\u0027 gang of veteran crooks carried off their record-breaking heist which inspired blockbuster movie starring Michael CaineThe Hatton Garden raid was the \u0027swansong\u0027 job of a gang of ageing crooks with dreams of retiring to the Costa del Sol.The gang drew on experiences from two crimes – the £26million Brink\u0027s Mat gold heist and the £6million Security Express cash robbery.The gang planned the raid for the long Easter bank holiday weekend when they believed they would be free to work uninterrupted after security guards locked up on Thursday night.Reader travelled to the site by bus using someone else\u0027s Freedom Pass, while Collins transported the rest of the gang, dressed as workmen in high-visibility vests, in a battered white Transit van.Seed, who had sourced a key to the building\u0027s heavy double wooden doors, let himself in.He then let his accomplices in through the fire escape where they brought in tools and equipment in wheelie bins along with large metal joists, while Collins acted as lookout from over he road at 25 Hatton Garden. They then dropped into the basement, where one of the men forced open the metal shutter before \u0027Basil\u0027 dealt with the alarms.          The industrial drill used in the break-inAlthough they had breached the wall on the first night, they were faced with another problem - the back of the metal cabinet housing the safe deposit boxes, which was bolted to the ceiling and floor. Almost ten hours after entering the building, with no success, the gang were forced to call time on their efforts and left for the night.The failure proved too much for Reader and he quit to the disgust of Perkins, who would later call him \u0027an old ponce\u0027 and said: \u002712 years I\u0027ve been with him, three four bits of work, f***ed every one of them.\u0027The gang arrived back at 88-90 Hatton Garden at 10pm the following night and Seed let Jones and Perkins in and the pair enthusiastically got to work battering the metal cabinet to the floor using the recently purchased pump. When they finally knocked the cabinet down, Basil and Jones squeezed through the hole and jemmied open as many of the safe deposit boxes as they could. When they emerged from the fire escape at 5.44am they had ransacked 73 of the 999 safe deposit boxes, 44 of which were being used by 40 tenants. Mysteriously, the burglars left a cassette tape found in one of the boxes of \u0027someone confessing to something\u0027 for the authorities to find.            They then made off in their white Transit van, now sitting low on its suspension, with just short of millions in of stolen gold, gems, jewellery and cash hidden in two wheelie bins. But the main players were caught out as they boasted of their exploits during a drinking session at the Castle pub in Islington and they were jailed in March 2016.Brian Reader was given six years while Collins, Terry Perkins, 69, Daniel Jones, 60, and William Lincoln, 63, all got seven years for conspiracy to commit burglary.They were later ordered to repay £27.5million between them or have their sentences increased.A week later Perkins died in jail while awaiting trial for his role in another raid. The raid inspired the film \u0027King of Thieves\u0027, which premiered on September 14 last year, and starred Michael Caine and Ray Winstone.      Brian Reader\u0027Career criminal\u0027 Brian Reader was known as \u0027the Guv\u0027nor\u0027 and was a partner in crime of notorious gangland figure Kenneth Noye - despite the fact the pair were like \u0027chalk and cheese\u0027.Aged 76, Reader is the oldest of the gang and he even travelled to the robbery on a bus using a pensioner\u0027s \u0027Freedom Pass\u0027.One police officer even described him as \u0027the last of the gentlemen thieves.\u0027The second-hand car dealer, from Dartford, was jailed for his part in the infamous Brink\u0027s Mat robbery in 1983.The notorious heist involved armed robbers stealing £26million in gold bullion from Brink\u0027s Mat, near London\u0027s Heathrow Airport.Reader was jailed at the Old Bailey in 1986 for conspiracy to handle stolen goods after plotting to with fellow crook Kenneth Noye to convert the gold.Noye was an expert in converting criminal property and even mixed some of the gold with copper coins to lessen its purity and disguise it. He then recruited Reader to help him sell the gold.Reader was also present at Noye\u0027s house on the night an undercover policeman, Detective Constable John Fordham, who had been monitoring Noye, was stabbed 11 times.After Fordham\u0027s death, his colleagues discovered 11 gold bars wrapped in red-and-white cloth hidden in a shallow gully beside the garage wall.Noye and Reader were found not guilty of the murder of DC Fordham but five months later both were jailed in 1986 for handling the stolen bullion.            Carl Wood Carl Wood, 58, was a trusted associate of the ringleaders, recruited as an \u0027extra pair of hands\u0027 to pull off the heist.Wood grew up in Hackney, has been married to wife Paula for 19 years and has two adult daughters who have children of their own.He was diagnosed with Crohn\u0027s disease in his early 20s, an inflammatory bowel disease which he claimed often left him bed-ridden and in agony.In conversations recorded by police bugs, Terry Perkins suggests Wood was vouched for by his old friend Billy Hickson, who stood trial alongside Perkins over the £6million Security Express heist.Wood was around £20,000 in debt, but in January 2015 attended the Adventure Travel Show, at the Kensington Olympia, featuring \u0027once-in-a-lifetime travel experiences\u0027 in apparent anticipation of his future wealth.He did not attend the planning meetings, but was regularly updated by his friend of 30 years, Daniel Jones.The pair would regularly meet for walks followed by sandwiches and coffee at their local gardening centre.Dressed in dark clothing, hi-visibility waistcoat and navy baseball cap and wearing a white surgeon\u0027s style mask dark gloves and glasses, Wood was one of the men who entered 88-90 Hatton Garden on the first night of the raid.In 1993 he stood trial with two police officers, who had teamed up with crook Robert Kean in a bid to recover £600,000 owed to the villain by an underworld financier.They were caught by police corruption busters who secretly filmed them at the hotel as Wood was heard bragging how he would beat the debtor with an iron bar after claiming he owed him £80,000.He was jailed for four years for his role in the plot. Morgan was branded \u0027despicable\u0027 as he was jailed for seven years, Costello was jailed for 30 months and Kean was given a seven-year sentence.

The stakes could not be higher. "},{"url":null,"title":"Kevin Spacey legal counsel seen leaving swanky Hollywood hotel Netflix lawyer staying","story":"    Shady driver: Kevin Spacey was filmed leaving the Sunset Tower Hotel in Los Angeles on Wednesday, with the actor trying to avoid detection as he speed off alone in his car (Spacey above on Wednesday)           K Spax: Spacey is about to start trial in Massachusetts for allegedly groping a teen, who said he was 23 at the time, while out at a bar in Nantucket     Lift: A member of the Netflix legal team who specifically deals with the streaming service\u0027s original content, Tim Caballero, was also at the hotel (Caballero above lifting at the hotel)The reason for Spacey\u0027s visit is a bit of a mystery, but it does seem likely that the actor was spending part of his time dealing with one of the many legal cases he is facing these days.Tim Caballero, a member of the Netflix legal team who specifically deals with the streaming service\u0027s original content, was at the Sunset Tower at the same time as Spacey.  Caballero, a lover of physical fitness, posted a video of himself lifting weights at the hotel to Instagram, using the Sunset Tower\u0027s gym despite the fact that he lives in Los Angeles. Axed man: Bryan Singer is fired from Red Sonja reboot after...Bono\u0027s partner in socially responsible investment firm is...Share this articleThe results of his lifting are on full display in his profile photo on the social media site, where he is seen swearing a black string bikini and cropped gray shirt. Spacey was removed as both the star and producer of House of Cards when allegations of sexual assault involving underage minors and other men began rolling in around late 2017, and also had his biopic about Gore Vidal shelved by the streaming giant.It is unclear how, or if, Spacey\u0027s contract with Netflix was ever settled in the wake of that decision.A Netflix spokesperson told DailyMail.com however that there are no negotiations between Spacey and Netflix at this time and called the fact that the two men were both at the hotel a coincidence.           Midnight in the garden of good and evil: His lawyer Jay Barron (above) appeared to be walking alongside the car to make sure that Spacey managed to exit without incidentThere is also the matter of a lawsuit against the actor which is set to be heard in Los Angeles federal court. A judge is set to rule in the coming days whether or not the man who has accused Spacey of sexual assault can remain anonymous during the upcoming trial. He has alleged that Spacey forced him to touch his genitals and groped him during a massage, while also claiming the actor tried to block him from leaving at points.Spacey allegedly let the masseuse go after his offer to perform an oral sex act was rebuffed by the man.Spacey\u0027s Los Angeles visit caught many by surprise, with the actor having declared months back that he is now a resident of Maryland.There is also little chance of a comeback for Spacey any time soon, with the actor having been fired or edited it out of almost every movie that was set for release in the wake of claims he attempted to sexually assault a then-underage Anthony Rapp.The one exception to that was Billionaire Boys Club, which was released in July and made $2.2 million at the box office on a $15 million budget. The incident that spurred Spacey\u0027s downfall allegedly took place at Spacey\u0027s apartment in 1986 when the actor invited Rapp to a party while they were both appearing on Broadway.In an interview with Buzzfeed, Rapp said that he found himself alone in the apartment at the end of the night and that Spacey then began to make his move.\u0027He picked me up like a groom picks up the bride over the threshold. But I don\u0027t, like, squirm away initially, because I\u0027m like, \u0027What\u0027s going on?\u0027 And then he lays down on top of me,\u0027 said Rapp, who detailed being pressed up against the bed before being able to squirm away and ultimately leave the house without being assaulted by Spacey.          Usual suspect: Spacey is also on trial in Massachusetts for allegedly groping a teen, who said he was 23 at the time, while out at a bar in Nantucket (above in January at his arraignment) Spacey made the decision to come out of the closet in a statement apologizing to actor Anthony Rapp, who said in an interview that the actor attempted to sexually assault him in 1986, an incident Spacey says he does not remember.Rapp was 14 at the time while Spacey was 26.The actor did get a bit of good news last week in his criminal case.Lawyers for the disgraced Oscar winner presented multiple motions to the judge, and while none of those motions have been ruled on, the judge did order that the man accusing Spacey of assault and his girlfriend-at-the-time preserve their phone and cloud records.The defense wants to extend the time period for which they can obtain any texts of saved information in the accuser\u0027s cloud from January 2017 to December 2017.That was the lone decision handed down on Monday, with the judge promising to rule on the other motions at the next hearing on April 4 in Nantucket.Spacey was not in court, after being told back in January that he would not be needed for the appearance.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Dads Army cast striking resemblance classic 1970s line recreate lost episodes","story":"    The new stars of Dad\u0027s Army pose as the stars of the classic sitcom, bearing an uncanny resemblance to the iconic charactersWhat\u0027s occurring?

This constituency voted in very large numbers for Brexit.   \u0027We need a deal, we need to get that over the line. But if we don\u0027t have a deal then we should leave with no deal.\u0027                        \u0027I\u0027ve been working very constructively with Steve Barclay since his appointment a couple of months ago despite the fact that he and I were vigorously on opposite sides of the debate during the referendum, and we are continuing to work very constructively together today and in the days to come.\u0027Mr Lidington said he believed that Leave-backing ministers had used the free vote as \u0027an opportunity to register how unhappy they were with being in the position where we don\u0027t really have an option as a country except to seek an extension of our time in the European Union\u0027.Mr Lidington said that leaving on March 29 with no deal remains the \u0027legal default position\u0027 but the likelihood of it happening had \u0027diminished\u0027 after this week\u0027s votes.He said he was still hoping that the UK will \u0027leave as soon as possible in an orderly fashion\u0027 by MPs backing Mrs May\u0027s Withdrawal Agreement next week.Asked if defeat for the PM\u0027s deal might mean an extension of a year or more, Mr Lidington said: \u0027Those are the indications which the Brussels institutions of the EU - the Commission, the Council secretariat and certain member state governments - have been giving to us.\u0027He added: \u0027I hope that MPs of all parties will be over this weekend just reflecting on the way forward.\u0027Tory whips asked both David Gauke and business minister Richard Harrington to resign over the rebellion on Wednesday night, sources said.But both were said to be standing their ground amid fears their departure would lead to a mass walkout by more than a dozen other \u0027Remain\u0027 ministers.One senior source told The Sun: \u0027It was all of us – or none of us. And there were other Ministers who voted with the Government on No Deal who would have gone too. The whips realised it wouldn\u0027t work.\u0027 Hours later she  wrested back control of the Brexit process from Parliament last night, despite a huge Tory split over plans to delay Britain\u0027s departure by three months.Earlier the Prime Minister gave a dressing down to Amber Rudd, Mr Gauke, Greg Clark and David Mundell after they helped Labour rule out a No Deal Brexit in all circumstances.Mrs May tore into the group for undermining her plan to confront MPs with a choice between her deal and a long delay to Brexit. One Cabinet source said Mrs May accused Miss Rudd and other Remainer rebels of \u0027disloyalty\u0027 for abstaining in the vote. Another told The Times: \u0027She went bat****.\u0027During the meeting, Chancellor Philip Hammond is said to have tried to explain the open rebellion by ministers, saying there was \u0027confusion\u0027 around Wednesday night\u0027s votes.He had been seen rowing with Chief Whip Julian Smith ahead of the ision. But Mr Smith told those assembled there was no excuse to break collective responsibility.He praised Sarah Newton for doing the honourable thing in resigning as a junior DWP minister so she could vote against, according to The Spectator.When Mr Clark attempted to explain his actions by saying he was \u0027confused\u0027, Mr Smith is said to have walked out of the meeting. Mr Clark\u0027s efforts to justify himself were said to have \u0027ended badly\u0027 after Mrs May shut him down. Later, Remainer ministers described the criticism of their conduct as unfair. One source said: \u0027They challenged the Chief Whip and the PM over the handling of the vote.

Furious MPs called for him to be sacked after the vote was lost. But it was unclear whether he had told them to abstain.Another MP said 30 rebels had held a pre-vote caucus, where they are said to have decided to abstain, undermining reports they were told they could.  Yesterday members of the \u0027gang of four\u0027 Remainer ministers who defied the Prime Minister over No Deal arrived in Downing Street together to face her for the first time.Brexiteers are furious Scottish Secretary David Mundell, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, Justice Secretary David Gauke and Business Secretary Greg Clark have not been sacked after they helped inflict a humiliating defeat on Theresa May in the Commons on Wednesday night.It came as Mrs May\u0027s chief of staff Gavin Barwell was also urged to quit over claims he went \u0027rogue\u0027 and told Remainer Cabinet ministers they could abstain without any fear of being axed. Ms Rudd arrived at No 10 with Mr Gauke and Mr Clark  minutes before she said she abstained because of the \u0027generational damage\u0027 she claims a No Deal Brexit would cause Britain.She added: \u0027If Brexit is delayed it is because many of my colleagues in Commons have refused to join those of us who have consistently voted for PM\u0027s good deal\u0027.  In a comical moment Ms Rudd\u0027s dramatic entrance to Downing Street was scuppered by under-fire Transport Secretary Chris Grayling who sidled over and scuppered the photo opportunity. The rebel cabinet members are said to have used the code word \u0027tally-ho!\u0027 before they helped inflict a humiliating defeat on the Prime Minister.  So how long WILL Brexit be delayed, can it be cancelled and will there be a second referendum? YOUR guide to what happens next after May won a vote on extending Article 50Theresa May finally gave up on Brexit happening on time tonight after MPs backed her plan to seek delay.With just 15 days until Britain was supposed to leave the European Union postponement appears to be almost inevitable.But the Prime Minister now faces two immediate new battles that will be played out over the next seven days - one in Westminster and then another in Brussels.How they go will determine whether Britain can still Brexit within weeks or will be forced to stay an EU member for months, years - or maybe even for good.    Theresa May finally gave up on Brexit happening on time tonight after MPs backed her plan to seek delay              Brenton Harrison Tarrant flashes white supremacist symbol in courtComic Relief pays tribute to Louis Tomlinson\u0027s late sister FélicitéDramatic footage within the mosque of the Christchurch attackChristchurch shooting victim posts video from his hospital bedFormer boss of Christchurch right-wing terrorist speaks outFamily footage of Madeleine McCann days before disappearanceSurvivors of terrorist attack in Christchurch speak outParents looking for missing son after Christchurch terror attackSee the jackscrew similar to one found in Ethiopian Airlines wreckNZ mosque shooting survivor: \u0027I had to jump the wall\u0027 to escapeMore than 40 people killed inside two New Zealand mosquesMrs May\u0027s first task is to have a third and possibly final attempt at getting her deal agreed by MPs.The stage is set for a new \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on the plan - probably on Tuesday or Wednesday, just a week after it was crushed a second time.The Prime Minister must find 75 votes to over turn this week\u0027s 149 drubbing. Talks are ongoing with her DUP allies, who have 10 MPs, while Brexit hardliners - amounting about 68 MPs - show signs of splitting.If Mrs May can pull off an unlikely victory, she will go to Brussels to seek a delay of up to three months to get the deal into law.If she fails, the Prime Minister will still have to appear at the EU headquarters next Thursday afternoon - but has already accepted she will be asking for a much longer delay. Failure will make the mission to Brussels a much harder task. The EU has demanded a clear outline of what delay is for and assurances Mrs May can deliver on what she says.Worse still, all 27 EU states must agree unanimously on the terms of any delay - and there are clear splits inside the bloc on what could and should be agreed.Mrs May will be excluded from the decision process as Britain does not get a vote on Brexit matters.The EU is likely to offer an extension of some kind as few in Brussels want a No Deal on March 29 but the Government is likely to have to accept conditions.This is likely to include continuing to pay £10billion a year in membership fees and taking part in European Parliament elections on May 22.If she secures a delay Mrs May will then need to pilot Britain to a new form of Brexit - knowing a delay of years gives time for her enemies to circle and oust her. A two year delay would give time for a General Election and even a referendum before the Government even tried to negotiate a new form of Brexit in time for whatever the new deadline is.  Could Brexit be stopped? Mrs May has warned this is a possibility. While she will not revoke Article 50 herself, she has warned political chaos could see the Government replaced by Jeremy Corbyn or another pro-Remain administration.If Article 50 is not revoked or extended on March 29, and UK law changed accordingly, Britain will leave the EU without a deal, despite the votes this week to block it.Could there be a third meaningful vote? Downing Street says yes but has not scheduled it. In practice, the new vote will be held on Tuesday or Wednesday next week Mrs May attends the EU Council on Thursday.The EU will not negotiate further on the deal so it would seem it is likely to be a rerun rather than a different deal to that which failed on Tuesday.But the events of this week could see Brexiteers swing in behind Mrs May\u0027s deal, little more than a week after overwhelmingly rejecting it. That will be what Mrs May will be hoping in any case. So it\u0027s a clear choice between June 30 or a much longer deal? Broadly. If MPs endorse the deal next week, the PM can negotiate the short term extension. If they don\u0027t it will be a longer delay - but with string attached the Commons will have to endorse.  Will there be a second referendum?   MPs voted against a second referendum by 334 to 85 today - the first time a direct vote has been called.But the vote was not binding and it is unlikely the question has been answered forever. If there is a long delay to Brexit, new referendum campaigners will move again.Organising a referendum will take about a year - to pass the laws, agree the question, appoint campaigns and have the actual battle.             Michel Barnier is among senior EU figures who have warned that Britain will only get an extension if it has a clear idea of what it would be used forBrenton Harrison Tarrant flashes white supremacist symbol in courtComic Relief pays tribute to Louis Tomlinson\u0027s late sister FélicitéDramatic footage within the mosque of the Christchurch attackChristchurch shooting victim posts video from his hospital bedFormer boss of Christchurch right-wing terrorist speaks outFamily footage of Madeleine McCann days before disappearanceSurvivors of terrorist attack in Christchurch speak outParents looking for missing son after Christchurch terror attackSee the jackscrew similar to one found in Ethiopian Airlines wreckNZ mosque shooting survivor: \u0027I had to jump the wall\u0027 to escapeMore than 40 people killed inside two New Zealand mosquesWhat will the EU tell Mrs May? EU leaders have already spelled out that an extension will not be granted just because British politics is bitterly ided.They want to see clear reasoning for extending Article 50. If she arrives with a deal that has been agreed between now and then it seems likely that a shorter extension could be agreed.If MPs still have not agreed a deal, they will want to see evidence that another plan is in place, like a second refrendum or a general election. But all of the EU\u0027s 27 other nations have to agree. Are there any other reasons they could refuse an extension? The EU has hinted at a two year delay, although some prominent figures have pushed for a short delay.Another key date is May 23. Mrs May\u0027s own motion points out that any extension beyond June 30 \u0027would require the UK to hold European Parliament elections\u0027 due to take place on that day.This would raise the prospect of Brexiteer MEPs like Nigel Farage running for office again.   European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said that Brexit should be completed before the European elections which take place between May 23 and 26.\u0027If the UK has not left the EU by then, it will be legally required to hold these elections,\u0027 he said.What happens if the EU27 do not agree to a delay to Brexit?A refusal to get an extension would most likely be because there was no deal in place and no alternative prospect. Despite last night\u0027s votes, it could see the UK leave without a deal on March 29 or try to force through a new deal in a matter of days.  Theresa Mays says Britain stands with New Zealand as she sends her \u0027deepest condolences\u0027 to the families of the dozens killed in the Christchurch Mosque massacresTheresa May today expressed her grief after one or more white supremacists stormed mosques in New Zealand to murder dozens of Muslims during Friday prayers.The horrifying attacks in Christchurch today have taken the lives of 49 people causing grief and consternation across the world.Today Theresa May led the messages of condolence from Britain with the Queen expected to respond later.Mrs May tweeted: \u0027On behalf of the UK, my deepest condolences to the people of New Zealand after the horrifying terrorist attack in Christchurch.

A screw found in the wreckage was set to push the nose of the plane down upon impact          Boeing 737 Max aircraft, pictured here at the Farnborough International Air Show last year, has been grounded across the world since the crashThe system was designed to prevent the 737 MAX from climbing too steeply and stalling, a problem that emerged when engineers discovered the placement of the plane\u0027s larger engines sometimes caused the craft to pitch up during climbs.In the two crashes, vertical speed oscillation of roughly 15 to 20 seconds is a telltale sign that suggests the MCAS system may have been involved,  R. John Hansman Jr., a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told the New York Times.He said that some oscillation is natural due to turbulence, but would typically have a  of either less than eight seconds or more than a minute. \u0027Even from the available data, there are similarities between the Lion Air case and this case in terms of this 15 second periodicity. That would point toward a similar phenomenon.

Pictured: The plane\u0027s black boxes arrive in the French capitalSimilarities between the flight path in the Lion Air incident and Sunday\u0027s Ethiopian Airlines crash have raised fresh questions about the system.Boeing said on Monday it has been working closely with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on development, planning and certification of the software upgrade, and it will be deployed across the 737 MAX fleet in the coming weeks.The FAA expects to approve these design changes no later than April 2019, it has said.Boeing shares rose as much as 1.5 per cent in midday trading, reversing course from losses of about 1.5 per cent earlier in the session. Earlier, it emerged that the pilot of the doomed Ethiopian Airlines jet requested permission \u0027in a panicky voice\u0027 to return to the airport shortly after takeoff.Within a minute of departure, Captain Yared Getachew reported a \u0027flight control\u0027 problem because the aircraft was well below the minimum safe height during a climb, it is claimed.     Investigation: One of the black box flight recorders from the crashed Ethiopian Airlines jet  After being cleared by the control room to turn back, Flight 302 climbed to an unusually high altitude and disappeared from radar over a restricted military zone, a source told the New York Times. All contact between air controllers and the Nairobi-bound Boeing 737 MAX 8 was lost five minutes after it took off, a person who reviewed air traffic communications told the newspaper.The report said air traffic controllers observed the jet \u0027oscillating up and down by hundreds of feet\u0027 prior to the crash which killed 157 on Sunday morning.Speaking in a \u0027panicky voice,\u0027 the doomed aircraft\u0027s captain is said to have requested permission to return to the airport almost immediately after takeoff as the plane \u0027accelerated to abnormal speed.\u0027          Yared Getachew (pictured) was the main pilot on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302\u0027Break break, request back to home,\u0027 the Times quoted the pilot as saying just prior to the crash. \u0027Request vector (direction) for landing.\u0027Boeing was criticised after the Lion Air crash for allegedly failing to adequately inform 737 pilots about the functioning of the stall prevention system.Ethiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde GebreMariam said the doomed flight\u0027s captain was an experienced aviator with more than 8,000 flight hours. Meanwhile, a French investigation into the crash  opened today as US aerospace giant Boeing stopped delivering the top-selling Max 8 aircraft.The MAX has been grounded worldwide following the disaster - the second involving the model in five months - and the fallout has left the company, regulators and airlines scrambling to respond. \u0027We are pausing the delivery of the 737 MAX until we come up with a solution,\u0027 a Boeing spokesman said Thursday, adding: \u0027We are going to continue the production but we are assessing our capacities.\u0027An Ethiopian delegation delivered the black boxes to France\u0027s BEA air safety agency \u0027and the investigation process has started in Paris\u0027, Ethiopian Airlines said Friday on Twitter.The BEA confirmed it had received the black box recorders from the plane, which was just four months old and crashed minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa on Sunday.BEA investigators will now try to retrieve information from the cockpit voice and flight data recorders, which were damaged in the disaster.Thousands of miles away, distraught families were demanding answers as they visited the deep black crater where the plane smashed into a field outside the capital, disintegrating on impact.Ethiopian Airlines, Africa\u0027s largest carrier, sent the black boxes to France because it does not have the equipment to analyze the data.The information that they contain helps explain 90 percent of all crashes, according to aviation experts.    Devastated relatives of crash victims have been visiting the site in recent days as investigations continue into the cause of the disasterOn Wednesday, US authorities said new evidence showed similarities between the Ethiopia crash and that of a Lion Air flight in Indonesia in October that killed 189 people.The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said findings from the crash site and \u0027newly refined satellite data\u0027 warranted \u0027further investigation of the possibility of a shared cause for the two incidents.\u0027 An FAA emergency order grounded 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 aircraft until further notice, effectively taking the aircraft out of the skies globally.The move came after a growing number of airlines and countries decided not to fly the planes or ban them from their airspace until it is determined there are no safety issues.US President Donald Trump told reporters the \u0027safety of the American people and all peoples is our paramount concern\u0027.FAA acting chief Daniel Elwell said the agency had been \u0027working tirelessly\u0027 to find the cause of the accident but faced delays because of the damage to the flight data recorders.The new information shows \u0027the track of that airplane was close enough to the track of the Lion Air flight\u0027 to warrant the grounding of the airplanes so more information can be gathered to determine if there is a link, Elwell said Wednesday on CNBC.    The MAX has been grounded worldwide following the disaster - the second involving the model in five months - and the fallout has left the company, regulators and airlines scrambling to respondBoeing\u0027s shares have fallen 12 percent in the days after the crash in Ethiopia, wiping out nearly $30 billion in value.The 737 MAX series is Boeing\u0027s fastest-selling model and it is still relatively new with fewer than 500 in service.There are 74 registered in the United States and 387 in use worldwide with 59 carriers, according to the FAA. The accounts of the recent crashes were echoed in concerns registered by US pilots on how the 737 MAX 8 behaves.At least four American pilots complained following the Lion Air crash that the aircraft would suddenly pitch downward shortly after takeoff, according to documents reviewed by AFP on the Aviation Safety Reporting System, a voluntary incident database maintained by NASA.In two anonymous reports on flights just after the Lion Air disaster, pilots disconnected the autopilot and corrected the plane\u0027s trajectory in response.It was unclear if US transport authorities review the database or investigated the incidents.However, the FAA said this week it had ordered Boeing to update its flight software and training.Questions about the Lion Air crash have honed in on a stall prevention system, the MCAS, designed to automatically point the plane\u0027s nose downwards if it is in danger of stalling.According to the flight data recorder, the pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 struggled to control the aircraft as the MCAS repeatedly pushed the nose down after takeoff.The Ethiopian Airlines pilots reported similar difficulties before their aircraft plunged to the ground. Why Investigators Fear the Two Boeing 737s Crashed for Similar Reasons - The New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"PIERS MORGAN 49 massacred innocent Muslims prove words lethal consequences Mr President","story":" I clicked on a Twitter link and saw his murderous rampage unfurl in real time, from his own body-camera, like some gruesomely graphic video war-game. Only this was real life, with real people being shot dead – men, women, children  The motivation for Tarrant’s murderous intent lay in very old-fashioned white supremacist ‘values’. He is seen left in the live stream and right in a picture from social mediaI don’t know how someone can calmly walk towards a child lying on the floor riddled with bullets, and then fire more into their tiny bodies.Yet that is what this monster did.In doing so, he proved himself to be just as sub-human as the ISIS terrorists he professes to detest, the barbarians who throw gay people off roofs, stone women to death and set fire to enemies in cages so they burn alive.By the time the Christchurch assassin, an Australian named Brenton Tarrant, was finished shooting up the Al Noor Mosque, at least 41 people were dead and scores more wounded, 20 critically.\u0027Trump is a symbol of renewed white identity and common...White House says it is \u0027outrageous\u0027 to connect mosque...Share this articleAt a second location, the Masjid Mosque in Linwood across the other side of city, seven more were killed as part of a carefully planned and co-ordinated attack.The joint attacks represented one of the bloodiest, most deadly mass shootings in modern history.And unlike the Las Vegas atrocity a year ago, for which killer Stephen Paddock’s motives remain a mystery, this time we know exactly why Tarrant did it.He posted an extensive 74-page ‘manifesto’ detailing his reasons.It was a rambling, incoherent litany of shockingly deluded nonsense that can be edited down to only one significant word: hate.This was an act of terrorism by a white supremacist that hates people not like him. Especially Muslims.And he hates them so much he felt compelled to kill them.Specifically, Tarrant said he had to murder these poor defenceless Muslims because he wanted to ‘ensure the existence of our people, and a future for white children’ and to ‘directly reduce immigration rates to European lands’.He chose New Zealand because it would show ‘nowhere in the world was safe’.In its execution, this was a very modern massacre.Tarrant cited the hugely popular violent video game Fortnite, saying it ‘trained me to be a killer’.He said he got the idea to target a mosque after watching a video on Facebook.And he then put cameras on himself so he could live-stream himself killing people.But the motivation for Tarrant’s murderous intent lay in very old-fashioned white supremacist ‘values’.His real hope was to spark a race war in America.That’s why he chose to carry out a mass shooting - believing that using a semi-automatic assault rifle would fire up renewed debate in the U.S. about gun laws.‘With enough pressure,’ he wrote, ‘the left wing within the United States will seek to abolish the second amendment, and the right wing within the U.S. will see this as an attack on their very freedom and liberty. This attempted abolishment of rights by the left will result in a dramatic polarisation of the people in the United States and eventually a fracturing of the U.S. along cultural and racial lines.’Tarrant also said he was a supporter of US President Donald Trump who he described as a ‘symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose.’Now let me be very clear: I don’t hold President Trump personally responsible for what happened in Christchurch.          Today, President Trump had another opportunity to firmly and equivocally denounce white supremacists and the far-right ideology they stand for. But he couldn’t do itThis attack happened because a deranged lunatic filled with raging hate perpetrated a wicked act of evil.But what I do hold President Trump responsible for is his abject failure to properly denounce these kind of white supremacists and make it crystal clear that he holds them in nothing but absolute contempt.He had a chance to do this after the appalling attack in Charlottesville in 2017 when a white supremacist drove his car into a crowd of people, killing civil rights activist Heather Heyer.But instead, Trump absurdly tried to draw some moral equivalence between the far right marchers and counter-demonstrators.‘You had people that were very fine people on both sides’ he said, in one of the most tone-deaf statements by any President in US history.What Trump SHOULD have done that day is denounce all far-right white supremacists as a shameful blight on America.He should have understood that his words, as the most powerful man on earth, have huge impact around the world, and that every far-right white supremacist will have taken succour from his failure to properly denounce them that day.As Democrat Senator Richard Blumenthal said today: ‘Words do have consequences and we know that at the very pinnacle of power in our own country, people are talking about ‘good people on both sides’.Trump tweeted after this morning’s attack: ‘My warmest sympathy and best wishes goes out to the people of New Zealand after the horrible massacre in the Mosques. 49 innocent people have so senselessly died, with so many more seriously injured. The U.S. stands by New Zealand for anything we can do. God bless all!’These are perfectly fine words in themselves but nowhere near enough.President Trump repeatedly insists he’s neither a racist nor someone who courts the support of white supremacists, and as someone who has known him a long time I believe him.But he IS guilty of allowing racists and white supremacists to think he’s ‘our guy’ with his inflammatory comments about Mexicans or casual ‘good people on both sides’ nonsense after white supremacist attacks.I was appalled when Trump retweeted a series of provocative and misleading Islamaphobic videos posted by a British far-right group Britain First in 2017.And despite telling me in an interview for Good Morning Britain that if I wanted an apology for his retweets then he’d give one, he never actually undid the retweets, even when Britain First was banned from Twitter.What kind of message does that send other than that he doesn’t care enough to stop emboldening these hideous people?Trump’s often violent rhetoric also disturbs me.Who knows what effect it has on disturbed, potentially violent minds?Last night, Trump promoted on Twitter an interview he’d given to Breitbart News in which he boasted how ‘tough’ his supporters could get.‘I have the support of the police,’ he said, ‘the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump. I have tough people, but they don’t play it tough, until they have go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad.’Today, very unusually, he deleted that tweet, presumably realising how awful it looked in the context of the events in Christchurch.            A wounded man is seen being helped from the scene of the massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand             The joint attacks represented one of the bloodiest, most deadly mass shootings in modern history But he should never have used those aggressive words in the first place.They sound like a call to arms, like he’s endorsing violence by his own supporters.Today, President Trump had another opportunity to firmly and equivocally denounce white supremacists and the far-right ideology they stand for.But he couldn’t do it.Instead, he just issued standard lame presidential condolences.This is not good enough, Mr President.When a far-right white supremacist names you as one of his inspirations for one of the worst terrorist attacks ever perpetrated, you need to come out and denounce him with the full force of your presidency.You need to show the world that you want nothing to do with these people or what they represent.More importantly, you need these people to know that and to hear it loudly and clearly from your lips.You have been very vocal about ISIS and how important it is to crush such an evil, violent terrorist cult.Well, far-right white supremacist terrorists like Brendon Tarrant are just as evil and violent and it is just as important to crush them too.Speak up against them, Mr President, or be rightly damned by your silence."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/03/15/15/163BF0E300000514-6814125-image-a-25_1552664312237.jpg","title":"Topshop boss Sir Philip Green prepares launch dramatic restructuring plan","story":"    Sir Philip Green is considering a Company Voluntary ArrangementSir Philip Green is preparing to launch a dramatic restructuring plan for his retail empire, which could come at the cost of hundreds of jobs.The tycoon\u0027s Arcadia Group, which owns chains including TopShop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, is preparing to unveil a company voluntary arrangement (CVA).Senior industry insiders have speculated he is looking for a buyer for all, or part, of Arcadia, which also owns brands including Wallis and Dorothy Perkins.But reports today suggest the billionaire may be considering a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), an agreement with creditors allowing a business to carry on trading while reducing or shedding its debts. In 2015 Green was embroiled in the BHS fiasco which saw him sell BHS to Dominic Chappell, who had been declared bankrupt three times. The chain went under with a huge pension fund black hole just a year later.The Arcadia pension fund is in deficit to the tune of £300m.

She also enjoys a reputation as a wily political operator with deep roots in the Democrat and New Labour camps.          Ms Latham is an American with duel citizenship and has her roots in the Democrat party and New Labour. She has worked with Tony Blair, She was brought in to help choreograph Bill Clinton’s re-election campaign in 1996, helped to sneak in Barack Obama’s proposed Cabinet nominations for secret interviews after his election in 2008, and helped prepare Hillary Clinton for the White House as part of what was described as her ‘covert operations team’. There may have been an added attraction for what appears to have been a selection made by the duchess, rather than Prince Harry.She hasn’t hidden her loathing of Donald Trump, describing him on US TV as ‘misogynistic’ and publicly supporting Mrs Clinton’s rival presidential campaign.Appointing a PR chief with a long-standing link to the Clintons – who of course Mr Trump hates – may be seen as a snub to the president.\u0027This appalling atrocity is an assault on all of us\u0027: Young...\u0027Loved up\u0027 Princess Beatrice and beau Edoardo Mozzi spark...Share this articleSources say the couple met Miss Latham, 48, only this year and were immediately drawn to her ‘firm but fair approach’. It is possible they were introduced via the duchess’s Hollywood friend George Clooney, whose wife Amal attended Meghan’s recent – and lavish – ‘baby shower’ festivities in New York.Clooney was involved in raising funds for the Hillary campaign.A former colleague yesterday described Miss Latham as ‘very smart and very good at dealing with difficult characters’. She is, he added, ‘very diplomatically adept’ and ‘not in it for the money’.It is estimated she is on a salary of £140,000 which is relatively modest for what she could be earning in the corporate sector. Miss Latham had recently rejoined the London PR firm, Freuds, as its managing partner.          Ms Latham was brought in to help choreograph Bill Clinton’s re-election campaign in 1996, helped to sneak in Barack Obama’s proposed Cabinet nominations for secret interviews after his election in 2008, and helped prepare Hillary Clinton for the White House as part of what was described as her ‘covert operations team’Reporting to the Queen’s press secretary Donal McCabe, Miss Latham will start her new job in the spring the couple’s baby is rumoured to be expected next month.Miss Latham will no doubt be paid as much as the palace could afford but spinning for the Sussexes would be no job for an amateur.She seems to have risen effortlessly through the political and corporate worlds in a career that has seen her repeatedly assist global figures including allies of the Clintons and Tony Blair.After being brought in for Bill Clinton’s successful 1996 re-election campaign, she worked as special assistant to Mr Clinton’s chief of staff, John Podesta.Between 1996 and 2000, Miss Latham held other White House roles including deputy assistant to the president and, until 2000, deputy director of presidential scheduling. That position brought her close to the then-first lady.After George W Bush won the 2000 presidential election, she moved to Brussels as a government affairs adviser for software giant Microsoft.The next year, she moved again, this time to London to become managing director of Philip Gould Associates, the PR firm set up by the late Lord Gould, the former Labour strategy and polling adviser who was close to Tony Blair.The Blair connection must have helped her move to Freud Communications in 2002. Its founder, Matthew Freud, was not only an ally of Mr Blair, but also had strong Democrat links.In 2005, she was seconded to work for Labour’s general election campaign, after which she was appointed as special adviser to Tessa Jowell, Mr Blair’s culture secretary – just as the department learned London would host the 2012 Olympics.Miss Latham left the Government in 2006 to set up her own consultancy. Naturally, her clients reflected her high-level contacts and included the Clinton Foundation and Tony Blair Associates as well as Coca-Cola and the Nelson Mandela Foundation.          The shake-up comes as Harry and Meghan prepare for their move away from Kensington Palace to Frogmore Cottage (pictured) on the Windsor Castle estateIn 2008, she returned to Washington DC – after a farewell party at a trendy Mayfair bar – to work again for the Democrats. This time she was employed by Barack Obama as he prepared to enter the White House. He had, of course, defeated her old boss Hillary Clinton in a heated battle for the Democrat nomination.But the Clintons endorsed Mr Obama at the party’s 2008 convention, urging supporters to vote for him.An expert, it appears, at helping politicians ‘transition’ into power, Miss Latham doesn’t hang around long in government – nor anywhere else, it seems.By 2011 she had returned to the corporate world as non-executive chairman of iEnergizer, a supplier of ‘back-office’ services to banks which is run by multimillionaire Anil Agarwal.Even in business, she did not allow her political links to wither, and was described in a 2012 report as the ‘go-to girl for top Democrats visiting London’. Miss Latham reportedly advised Michelle Obama on which restaurants to visit in the UK.The year after it was back to politics to join Hillary Clinton’s campaign for president. Miss Latham was appointed chief of staff to John Podesta, now chairman of Mrs Clinton’s campaign. A presidential candidate’s selection of running mate is an enormously sensitive operation. John McCain discovered this when he disastrously chose Sarah Palin in 2009 and internal staff tensions were leaked to the media.Mrs Clinton was determined that shouldn’t happen again and Miss Latham was asked to oversee a VP selection process that was shrouded in secrecy.As part of a ‘covert operations team’, Miss Latham marshalled reports drawn up by 15 law firms asked to vet candidates. She then printed them out in secret and posted them to Mrs Clinton.As Mrs Clinton flew with Senator Tim Kaine – her eventual choice – to the Florida rally where she would break the news, Miss Latham lightened the mood by persuading him to pull out his harmonica. He obliged, playing a Beatles tune.Confident she would win comfortably, Mrs Clinton appointed Miss Latham one of three aides to oversee ‘transition planning’ for her new administration.That particular transition, of course, was never to happen.Sara Latham likes to move on regularly in her career. One hopes for the duke and duchess’s sake she hangs around long enough to handle their often shifting public image. "},{"url":null,"title":"Tory voters want MPs save Theresa Mays Brexit deal","story":"    Theresa May (pictured above) could get her Brexit deal through according to the results of a new poll Theresa May’s hopes of getting her Brexit deal through at the third attempt next week received a boost last night when Conservative voters piled pressure on rebel MPs to rescue her.They want hard-line Brexiteer and Remainer Tories threatening to defeat the Prime Minister to toe the line and prefer her deal to all the possible alternatives, including leaving with No Deal, a ‘softer’ Brexit, a second referendum and a two-year delay in leaving.And Mrs May can kiss goodbye to calling a snap election to get her plan approved: the mass revolts by ministers in shambolic scenes in the Commons in recent days have put Labour ahead in the polls.These are the main findings of a Survation poll for the Daily Mail.

It’s really upsetting that it’s often adults and older children who are just too lazy to go to a bin.I decided to do something positive last year.

Paxman is usually more inclined towards grilling university students on BBC quiz show University Challenge, which he has presented since 1994, and has decline several television opportunities including Big Brother and Strictly Come DancingBut it is definitely not easy to apply to ginger biscuits through the nozzle of a plastic bag.Each time I tried to squeeze out a dribble of icing to replicate the dog’s colouring, a volcano erupted at the other end of the bag, covering my hands. Royal Icing is sugar and egg-white. Having it all over your hands does not make precision easier.Poor old Derek would have happily eaten them, of course. But, then he lives on dog biscuits. And he certainly would not have recognised himself.For the ‘technical challenge’ we were asked to make chocolate crumpets, which, frankly, are such a disgusting notion that no self-respecting human being should have a clue what they are.I would not presume to dispense advice about baking, but if any reader is ever inveigled into Crumpet Madness, it is important to take seriously the advice about only half-filling the funny container things with batter.          The presenter claims that Paul Hollywood surprised him by saying that his lemon drizzle cake tasted good, and Prue Leith had taken some of it home with herFor reasons which escape me now, I decided to put a figure of Prue Leith, a fellow fisherperson, on a rock overlooking the water. I think by now I could sniff failure in the air (along with the smell of burning) and was trying to be smarmy.I eventually settled for what I thought was an adequate model of Prue in long raincoat, with what was either a deer-stalker or a sou’wester on her head. She didn’t seem much impressed when she saw it.I didn’t have enough icing to cover the sides, but Paul Hollywood said that it was quite fashionable to leave them in their natural state.I told him that was the look I was going for. But on reflection perhaps he was trying to be diplomatic.And that was it. It took two days and dozens of crew to produce one episode. I am not going to disclose who won our episode and accept that agreeing to take part was an impulsive thing to do. But I shall look forward to seeing Jon Snow put his money where his mouth once apparently was.If nothing else, I have discovered that baking is much harder than it looks but raising money for cancer research is a good enough cause for public humiliation.True, it was insulting for the producers to try to confiscate our phones in case we looked up help online: as if any of us cared enough to cheat.And I’d have been a lot more impressed if the production company involved had donated their fee to Stand Up To Cancer, and if the vast number of techies had also been working for free, but there we are.Paul Hollywood said with surprise that my lemon drizzle cake tasted good, and Prue Leith took some of it home with her.A career as a pastry chef does not beckon. From now on, I shall stick to eating things baked by others. I can manage that easily.The Great Celebrity Bake Off ... for Stand Up To Cancer is on Channel Four on Tuesdays at 8pm. Jeremy Paxman appears in episode four on March 26.

The car also includes a boost gauge, chromed bezels, black-lacquered furnishings and Bentley badges in the waistrails.The Continental R was the first all-new-bodied Bentley coupe since the stunning R-Type Continental of 1952, rightly considered among the most beautiful cars ever created.A total of 1548 were built, including 158 bespoke Mulliner editions, 44 Le Mans Series and 11 ‘Final Series’ of the type I was driving.A Bentley spokesman noted: ‘The Continental R re-established Bentley as a premium sporting marque in its own right, and is a considered a classic. It was the fastest, most expensive, and most powerful Bentley of its day. It was also the most expensive production car in the world at launch.’"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Red Line Luas services have been suspended from BlackhorseGarda\u0026iacute have since found the gunThe collision involved a truck and two cars in Carracanada in SwinfordSeveral North Lotts apartment owners \u0026lsquohad no knowledge\u0026rsquo objection made in their nameSeveral incidents of intimidation and abuse directed against Muslim women recordedCheltenham\u0026rsquos most successful trainer says racing will manage changes from UK exitHoteliers and retailers worry what Brexit might mean for jump racing\u0026rsquos biggest festivalDepartment prepares for 300,000 extra requests in event of UK crashing out of EUUS president has previously said he intends to come to Ireland \u0026lsquoat some point this year\u0026rsquoMary Cregan (33) a nurse at University Hospital Limerick had brain tumourGovernment acknowledges US president likely to face protests rather than cheering crowdsAdditional Garda patrols outside mosques to reassure members of the communitySpecial Criminal Court told items in Kildare property were found later by home ownerBlaze at former Donaghy\u0026rsquos Mill site has sent plumes of smoke into the skies above townRainfall across Connacht, midlands and south could lead to spot floodingInfant transferred from Tipperary to Temple Street Children\u0026rsquos Hospital, DublinIreland squad \u0026lsquoshocked and saddened\u0026rsquo by killings at mosques in ChristchurchReports from three doctors all expressed view man lacks capacity to make decisions about his welfare and finances"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3827803.1552685603!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord tokens istanbul convention and independent women","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRunner in Dublin’s Kimmage-Rathmines ward Samantha Long: political parties got almost €6 million in State funding in 2017. A new injection would allocate €500,000 more to “already generously funded party machines”. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill A special Cabinet meeting was held recently to mark the Government collecting the last few tokens it required to claim a new kettle for the ministerial kitchenette.The celebratory gathering last Friday may have been a short one, but it was “special”, requiring a special off-campus venue and special photographs to record the occasion.The meeting also marked International Women’s Day. There was a particular focus on gender equality as it comes with extra tokens, which is wonderful because the Taoiseach has his eye on a four-slice toaster.The Cabinet, of course, meets every week to discuss issues of national importance which are deemed relevant enough to make the agenda as a matter of course and don’t need to be designated as special.This is where the real decisions are made.Nonetheless, despite the token song and dance made about an International Women’s Day Cabinet meeting, it came with the good news announcement that Ireland has ratified the Istanbul Convention.The convention is a significant international agreement obliging governments to fully address the issue of violence against women, to protect women against all forms of violence and to prosecute perpetrators.Ireland signed the convention three years ago and is now the 34th out of 47 Council of Europe member states to ratify it.There were many announcements in the wake of this special Cabinet meeting, including one which was so good it had to be made twice.On Monday, Minister for State John Paul Phelan issued a press release announcing how he and senior Minister Eoghan Murphy “secured Cabinet agreement on a range of new measures to promote increased participation by women in the upcoming local elections and greater gender equality on local councils”.Good idea. Just 21 per cent of women were elected at local level in 2014, a figure well below the European average. Following “consultations with key stakeholders” the Government agreed a series of measures designed to redress the balance.Funding schemeThese include an information campaign, special training and network events, the introduction of family-friendly policies in local councils and continuing financial support for the Women for Election organisation.One measure has gone down well with the political parties. A new funding scheme is being rolled out in time for the elections in May “to incentivise political parties to increase the proportion of female candidates”.The money will be paid over after the election and is “ring-fenced for political party activities to promote the participation of women in local elections”.Good news for the parties, but not much help to the many women intending to stand as Independents. Samantha Long, who is running in Dublin’s Kimmage-Rathmines ward, immediately rattled off a letter to The  complaining that the proposal is unfair to Independent candidates who will receive nothing.She pointed out that political parties received almost €6 million in State funding in 2017. This latest injection would allocate a further €500,000 to “already generously funded party machines”.She wrote that if the Government really wanted to see more women elected to public office it wouldn’t bring in a scheme “where some candidates are more equal than others, namely the women who hold a political party membership card, particularly given the strong swing towards non-aligned Independents recorded in last week’s Ipsos MRBI poll”.Long tweeted the letter, drawing it to the particular attention of all the female Independent TDs.‘Open to all’John Paul Phelan swiftly tweeted a reply: “I’ve instructed officials to make sure the scheme is open to all.”“What does that mean?” asked a Twitter user called Steve, not unreasonably.John Paul, missing the point, responded: “Basically that we need to drastically increase upon the 21 per cent of councillors who are women.”Samantha Long came back to explain that Steve was asking “what it now means for Independents like me, not the generalities” while complimenting him on his “great Richard Bruton-style” response which is “to answer what you want, not the actual question”.Independent Senator Gerard Craughwell took up the cudgels a few hours later in the Seanad.“When will the Government recognise there is more to Irish politics than political parties?” he asked. It seems Phelan is offering €100 per female candidate to political parties but “what about the fine Independent women who represent their local communities throughout the country?”While Craughwell was happy to see the Government provide funding to boost the election of more women, “the notion that it applies only to political parties is repugnant in every way”.All the Independent women are now waiting to find out whether John Paul’s declaration “to make sure the scheme is open to all” will work in practice.Perhaps he will give them tokens which can be redeemed at a later date.Motherly wisdom of Healy-RaesThe Dáil is well familiar with the names of Jackie Healy-Rae, Micheal Healy-Rae and Danny Healy-Rae. And with a plethora of little Healy-Raes flying around on various levels of the political nursery slopes in Kerry, a few more Healy-Raes may land up in Leinster House in the future.But another one made it into the Dáil record on Wednesday – Mammy Healy-Rae.An Bord Pleanála “is an out of control monster in the decisions it is making” he thundered. The same can be said for An Taisce. The people in those organisations “need to be reined in”.“The late Julie Healy-Rae, my mother, always said that if An Taisce in its present format were there in the 1940s and 1950s, we would have no rural electrification quite simply because they would have objected to the poles going up to run the wires into people’s homes in the countryside. And that is a fact, and if you think seriously about it, she was right. There would be no light in rural Ireland if the people that are around today were around then, well, we wouldn’t have light now.”‘Hunted out of Athenry’Objectors to planning permission had robbed a community in south Kerry of a social focal point and a source of employment in the same way that Apple was “hunted out of Athenry” by objectors, he fumed.“Tánaiste, what in the name of God is going to be done in Ireland to deal with the planning process?” he asked Simon Coveney. “How are we going to root out these serial objectors, these do-gooders for nothing?“They never did anything, they never created anything in their lives only writing out a stupid piece of paper giving €20 to a local authority or €200 to Bord Pleanála and then we have people inside An Bord Pleanála who will go against everything.“They go against Government policy, they go against local authority policy, our elected members, members of our county councils who are democratically elected. And them people then will throw all that out the window and rob us.”Michael felt he would get a decent hearing from the Tánaiste, unlike You Know Who, who is normally in the chair for Leaders’ Questions. The Rural Independents Group and the Healy-Raes in particularly have little time for Leo Varadkar.“Tánaiste, you know these things in your heart and soul and it’s good to be asking a person of substance and ability and able to answer a question. And you know my feelings on that and I’m very glad to see you sitting there and the longer you actually sit there the better it might be” he said, buttering up Coveney.Before he stressed he couldn’t interfere in the planning process, the Tánaiste thanked Healy-Rae for the compliment.“I sense a bit of a honey trap here,” he giggled.There was silence in the chamber before Micheál Martin hastily interjected: “We’ll spare you that.”\u0026nbspEx-Civil ServiceThere were warm tributes from all sides of the House on Tuesday for Patricia Doran, who retired from the Civil Service this week after 28 years’ toil in Leinster House.“Patricia typifies all that is good, decent and honourable about the Civil Service,” said the Ceann Comhairle, who also referred to her “encyclopaedic knowledge of standing orders, salient rulings of the chair and general procedural matters”.The Tánaiste said he knew Patricia wouldn’t be comfortable with all the attention she was receiving in the chamber. “Normally, she is facilitating the other egos in this House to be the centre of attention,” he remarked. “Without people like Patricia Doran, democracy as we know it today would not function.”Claire Daly spoke on behalf of Independents 4 Change and as a member of the Business Committee, which came under Patricia’s remit. “It has been my privilege to work alongside her. She embodies a quintessential lady with the heart of a tiger which I think is what we need. She is firm and effective. The world’s gain is our loss in here. I wish her all the very best.”\u0026nbspPeriod dramaThere was a period poverty box in the public concourse of Leinster House all week. After three days in situ, it was full to the brim with donated sanitary products, and bags containing more were piled up on the floor at the base of it.The exercise was part of an initiative by the Oireachtas Women’s Caucus to highlight the issue of period poverty, a term describing how girls and women sometimes can’t afford to buy necessary sanitary products.The Caucus held an information meeting on the issue on Tuesday in the lead-up to its Dáil motion on Wednesday calling for the provision of free sanitary products and menstrual information in all public buildings.Catherine Martin of the Greens, who chairs the Women’s Caucus, said she was delighted their cross-party motion received the full support of the Dáil.But she was disappointed by the lack of engagement from male TDs. The large AV room was packed for their information meeting, but just two male deputies turned up – her party leader, Eamon Ryan, and the Independent TD for Clare, Dr Michael Harty. A few more managed to make it into the Dáil.‘Mention of menstruation’“Mention of menstruation appears only 27 times in the Oireachtas record,” said Martin, and this was usually to do with issues around fertility and childbearing. “Now that figure is nearer to 70.”Fine Gael’s Marcella Corcoran-Kennedy, vice-chair of the caucus, mentioned their press conference on the plinth earlier in the day.“Four female journalists were in attendance. Disappointingly, not one male journalist saw fit to attend, not one television station, including our State broadcaster, saw fit to cover this item. So we certainly have an uphill battle ahead to have this important issue discussed more widely when those responsible covering the news stories don’t consider this issue important enough to turn up.”We hope she noticed our own Harry McGee above on the press gallery during the debate. He was making amends for entering an Ethiopian monastery on a trip with the Taoiseach last year when female journalists and female members of the Taoiseach’s party were told to wait."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3827170.1552654458!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit s next step accept a polished turd or ballot boxes loom","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn anti-Brexit protester outside the Houses of Parliament on Wednesday. Photograph: Jack TaylorGetty ImagesIt was 20 minutes before MPs were due to vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal on Tuesday evening, and the Conservative MP\u0026nbspSteve Double didn’t know what to do. “I am still in a quandary. The choices before us tonight are between two wrongs, two things that I do not want to happen,” he told the packed chamber of the House of Commons.“One option – if you will excuse my language, Mr Speaker – is a turd of a deal, which has now been taken away and polished so that it is a polished turd, but it might be the best turd that we have before us. The alternative would be to stop Brexit altogether.”Double went on to vote for the deal, but his support made little difference because it was defeated by 149 votes, with 75 Conservatives rejecting it. The prime minister, who had all but lost her voice, told the House it now faced a choice between leaving the EU without a deal on March 29th and postponing Brexit.Subsequent days showed that the prime minister had lost control not only of the House of Commons and Conservative MPs but also of her own cabinet. Four cabinet ministers defied a three-line whip to abstain on the vote on a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday\u0026nbspbut kept their jobs after a nod and a wink from one of the prime minister’s aides.On Thursday evening, Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay closed the debate on the government’s motion calling for an extension of the article 50 negotiating deadline.“It is time for this House to act in the national interest. It is time to put forward an extension that is realistic. I commend the government motion to the House,” he said.Then he walked into the No lobby to vote against the motion he had just commended, along with six other cabinet ministers and almost two-thirds of Conservative MPs. It was a free vote, and the motion passed comfortably with the support of Labour and other opposition MPs.But Labour’s Jess Phillips spoke for many observing proceedings in the Commons this week when she shouted across to Conservative Brexiteers during one of the votes on Wednesday: “National interest, my arse.”Despite the chaos and humiliation of the past week, however, May is still in charge of the Brexit process after MPs narrowly defeated an attempt to give Parliament control of the agenda.And her Brexit deal, twice rejected by MPs, will be back before them again next week for another go.If the deal wins a majority, the prime minister will ask the EU to postpone Brexit by three months until June 30th to allow implementation legislation to be passed. But she has told MPs that if they reject the deal a third time, the EU will only agree to a long extension – perhaps as long as 21 months – so that Britain can come up with an alternative plan.Some Brexiteers, including former Brexit secretary David Davis, who voted with the government this week, now believe that the alternative to backing May’s deal is a long delay that could see Brexit abandoned.Others such as Mark Francois, who served as a junior officer in the Territorial Army during the 1980s, still rule out backing the deal.“Because it’s not a win, it’s a lose. I’m not going to back a lose. I was in the army, I wasn’t trained to lose,” he told the BBC this week.Government whips believe that persuading the DUP to support the deal will lead most Conservative Brexiteers to follow suit, and negotiations with Nigel Dodds and other senior figures in the party will continue throughout the weekend. The government accepts that no further concessions, assurances or clarifications will be available from Brussels, so it must come up with its own inducements.DUP leader Arlene Foster said in Washington on Thursday that her party was working hard with the British government to ensure that there would be a Brexit deal.“The important thing is Northern Ireland is not left behind. That we leave altogether, that we have that constitutional and economic integrity for the UK. And we have long said that Stormont should play a role in this. We wanted Stormont to have a meaningful say in Brexit and we still believe that to be the case,” she said.The talks are understood to be focused on three strands:\u0026nbsplegal assurances that the backstop cannot endure indefinitely guarantees that there will be no dynamic ergence of regulations between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK without Stormont’s approval and funding for projects and less well-off areas in the North.The legal assurances are the most important and difficult element, and they require attorney general Geoffrey Cox to change the legal advice he gave about the deal last Tuesday.Cox concluded that the assurances on the backstop May won in Strasbourg on Monday night, including a joint interpretive instrument and a unilateral British declaration, reduced the risk that Britain could be trapped indefinitely in the Northern Ireland backstop.“However, the legal risk remains unchanged that if through no such demonstrable failure of either party, but simply because of intractable differences, that situation does arise, the United Kingdom would have, at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same, no internationally lawful means of exiting the protocol’s arrangements, save by agreement,” he said.Later that day, Barclay sought to beef up the attorney general’s advice, telling MPs that if Britain believed the objectives of the Northern Ireland protocol – supporting peace by keeping the Border open – were no longer being proportionately served by the backstop because it was no longer protecting the Belfast Agreement in all its dimensions, it could seek to walk away from it.“Article 62 of the Vienna convention on the law of treaties, which is reflective of the customary international law, permits the termination of a treaty in such circumstances.\u0026nbspIt would, in the Government’s view, be clear in those exceptional circumstances that international law provides the United Kingdom with a right to terminate the withdrawal agreement,” he said.The Daily  reported on Friday that Cox has updated his legal advice to state that Britain will be able to end the backstop if it is having a “socially destabilising effect on Northern Ireland”, which would be considered a fundamental change of circumstances under the terms of the treaty.But the paper said that a “star chamber” of eight eurosceptic lawyers, including Dodds, has already rejected the new advice as “clearly erroneous”. They point out that the Vienna Convention allows a treaty to be terminated only if there is an unforeseen change in circumstances. And they cite a 1997 case when Slovakia sought to be released from an agreement with Hungary over a hydro-electric dam project that was signed before the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact.“Saying they are ‘exceptional’\u0026nbspdoes not make them so in the eyes of international law. Hungary undoubtedly thought there was something ‘exceptional’ about the collapse of Soviet tyranny and the liquidation of the other state party with which Hungary had concluded the treaty in question. But that was not enough,” the lawyers said.\u0026nbspIn a paper for the centre-right think tank Policy Exchange, legal academics Guglielmo Verdirame, Stephen Laws and Richard Ekins argue that the concessions May won in Strasbourg on Monday have been underestimated. They say that the concepts of “good faith” and “best endeavours” are more powerful in international law than in commercial law and point out that the EU has been fully apprised of Britain’s intention to leave the customs union and the single market.“The EU has accepted in the Political Declaration that the final agreement will have to ‘ensure the sovereignty of the United Kingdom and the protection of its internal market’ as well as respect ‘the result of the 2016 referendum including with regard to the development of its independent trade policy and the ending of free movement of people between the Union and the United Kingdom’. Having assumed an obligation of best endeavours to conclude an agreement that replaces in whole the backstop, an argument to the effect that the EU would not advance any proposals other than those amounting to UK membership of the Single MarketCustoms Union would create, particularly over time, a very serious risk of breach by the EU,” they say.If a combination of legal assurances, guarantees about Stormont’s role under the backstop and more money for Northern Ireland are enough to persuade the DUP to back the deal, most Conservative Brexiteers in the European Research Group will follow suit.The whips know that a hard core of perhaps a couple of dozen will vote against the deal no matter what. But they believe that some could be persuaded to change their minds if May promises to step down as prime minister in the summer. For many Brexiteers, putting a true believer in Brexit in charge of the next phase of the negotiations is crucial, and the next leader of the Conservative party is likely to come from their ranks.The deal could just stagger over the line next week if the DUP, most Conservative Brexiteers and up to 20 Labour MPs back it. If that happens, May will go to the European Council next Thursday to seek a short extension of article 50 so that she can pass the required legislation to put the Brexit deal into action.If the deal is rejected, the picture becomes more complicated, and EU leaders are ided over what should happen next. Some believe that any extension must still be short because they fear that Brexit will otherwise continue to be a distraction from more important issues surrounding the future of the EU.Others argue that a long extension lasting anything between nine and 21 months is needed for Britain to resolve the political crisis that has made navigating Brexit so difficult. A long extension would give MPs time to find a cross-party consensus on the form Brexit should take, or, failing that, to hold a general election that might produce a different majority.It would also offer Britain a chance to hold a second referendum that could reverse the decision to leave the EU.A long extension raises the question of whether Britain would have to hold European Parliament elections in May. Both the European Commission and European Council legal services believe they must hold elections, although the European Parliament takes a different view.Some member states fear that Britain could use its continued membership to obstruct EU business in an attempt to influence Brexit negotiations, and they will demand that London makes a voluntary commitment to stay out of talks on matters such as the next EU budget round.If May’s deal is rejected next week and the EU offers a long extension to article 50, MPs will have a chance on March 25th to debate other options. On the prime minister’s past form, there is no reason to believe that those options would not include a fourth opportunity to approve her deal, four days before what was supposed to be Brexit Day.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

faithful wwi horse blackie form centrepiece housing development","story":"How the memorial to Blackie the First World War horse might lookShortly before his death at the Battle of Ypres in June 1917 the young Lieutenant Leonard Comer Wall made one very special request.The 20-year-old’s wish was that, should he was killed in action, his campaign medals and decorations be buried with his faithful horse Blackie.That moving final request was fulfilled when Blackie died years later and was buried, in Halewood, Liverpool, at the site of a horse sanctuary where he was seeing out his final days.Now Blackie’s grave is to become the centerpiece of a new housing development, following a public campaign to save it for posterity.The grave had been threatened with demolition after the closure of an RSPCA animal centre built on the site of the horse sanctuary.Historic England intervened to give Blackie’s grave a Grade II listing, making it the only resting place of a First World War horse to be protected in this way.In order to prevent any future threat to the grave Knowsley Council has now released plans for it to become the focal point of a proposed new housing development.Blackie\u0026#39s Grade II listed grave, in Halewood, LiverpoolThe grave will be incorporated into a striking memorial to Blackie set amid a wild flower meadow, with its own pedestrian and cycle route to encourage visitors to view the site.  A spokeswoman for Knowsley council, who have promised to “protect and enhance” Blackie’s grave within its draft masterplan for the new estate, said: “We are consulting with three developers at the moment, but the grave of Blackie the war horse is going to be preserved on its original site, so it can’t be demolished or moved.  “We are going to make a big deal of it, with commemorative public art erected around the grave.  The site has such strong cultural and historical significance, it is going to be a key area of public open space including an area for memorial services and wild meadow planting that will celebrate the story and history of Blackie.”The grave was listed by Historic England in December 2017 after a member of the public contacted it raising concerns over the proposed redevelopment of the RSPCA owned land, following the planned closure of the animal welfare charity’s Halewood branch.Blackie’s story of duty and devotion had long resonated with the people of Liverpool.He was born around 1905 and belonged to Lieutenant Wall, a war poet from Kirby who was posted to the Western Front in September 1915 after obtaining a commission with the 275th Brigade Royal Field Artillery ‘A’ Battery, 55th West Lancashire Division.  Wall was killed while riding Blackie at Ypres on 9th June 1917 and though his horse sustained severe shrapnel injuries during the battle, he nonetheless remained in front line service for the remainder of the conflict,  one of an estimated eight million horses that served during the First World War.By 1918 he had seen action in the battles of the Somme, Ypres, Aras and Cambrai.  Horse like Blackie were integral to the war effort, performing cavalry roles but also pulling ambulances, moving supplies, guns and equipment.The vast majority died, and their value was such that some troops were told that losing a horse was a more significant loss in tactical terms than losing a human soldier.At the end of the devastating conflict Lieutenant Wall’s mother Kate bought Blackie from the Army and lent him to the Territorial Riding School in Liverpool. His tasks included leading the city’s May Day Horse Parade with another former war horse called Billy.Blackie retired in 1930 and went to live at the Horses Rest in Halewood where he remained until his death in 1942, when Wall’s medals were buried with him.The faithful horse’s death struck a chord across wartime Britain, receiving coverage in the local Liverpool Daily Post as well as the Gloucester Citizen, Portsmouth Evening News, and Dundee Evening .Lieutenant Wall is buried at Lijssenthoek Military Cemetery in West Flanders, close to Blackie’s groom Francis Frank Wilkinson, who was killed in action the day before Wall.Historic England said it would expect to be formally consulted by Knowsley council over the memorial plans, especially if they involved moving the site of the grave itself.A spokeswoman for Historic England said: “Blackie’s grave marks where he spent his final years at the Liverpool Horse’s rest and we believe the bones are still in this location, so that would need to be a consideration. It would also be a case of whether moving it is necessary, or if the developers could work around the grave and potentially enhance it.”Senior Tory Nick Boles quits local association amid efforts to deselect him over Brexit viewsComment: Why, with a heavy heart, Brexiteers should now back Theresa May\u0026#39s dealComment: I still won\u0026#39t back Mrs May\u0026#39s deal – because it\u0026#39s not BrexitComic Relief: Stars raise more than £40 million in Red Nose Day charity driveNew Zealand shooting: Brenton Tarrant charged after 49 killed in attacks on two mosques in Christchurch - latest newsComment: Like Isil murderers, far-Right racists want to destroy our pluralistic societiesWe should not fear \u0026#39editing\u0026#39 embryos to enhance human intelligence, says leading geneticist George ChurchComment: I feel for Theresa May – losing one\u0026#39s voice is like going through pubertyComment: Can we please stop garlanding children for being wrong?New Zealand massacre victims: Afghan refugee viewed country as \u0026#39slice of paradise\u0026#39Smart meters with switching problems still being installed in homes after deadlineMan dies in stabbing after fight in south-west London\u0026#39End of innocence\u0026#39: How world reacted to New Zealand terror attackComic Relief 2019: A tear-jerking Four Weddings sequel, David Beckham with jokes and just a flash of a sonic screwdriverNew Zealand mosque shootings: everything we know so far about the Christchurch attacksAmal Clooney joins forces with Prince Charles for award for unsung young womenForeign students can stay in UK for longer after their degree ends to boost post-Brexit economyOne Red Nose Day and a Wedding, review: Comic Relief Four Weddings centerpiece was a clumsy comedy of manners that never quite came offWatercress growers plan trendy makeover as Millennials are snubbing it We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/family/2019/02/14/TELEMMGLPICT000186574005_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgmFsEjQK2M33nnfQ31Q2_6Mr0t7-tWp3mWf_CMz8V_E.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"can please stop garlanding children wrong","story":"16-year old Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg has inspired thousands of other youngsters across the world to get protestingSchoolgirl activist Greta Thunberg has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for leading the much-publicised “children’s strike” against global warming.

We would like the government to go further and extend this opportunity to at least two years and we will continue to urge them on this point.”Education Secretary Damian Hinds said: “The UK’s education system is world-leading and its reputation is the envy of many countries around the globe.“As we prepare to leave the EU it is more important than ever to reach out to our global partners and maximise the potential of our best assets – that includes our education offer and the international students this attracts.”Senior Tory Nick Boles quits local association amid efforts to deselect him over Brexit viewsComment: Why, with a heavy heart, Brexiteers should now back Theresa May\u0026#39s dealComment: I still won\u0026#39t back Mrs May\u0026#39s deal – because it\u0026#39s not BrexitComic Relief: Stars raise more than £40 million in Red Nose Day charity driveNew Zealand shooting: Brenton Tarrant charged after 49 killed in attacks on two mosques in Christchurch - latest newsComment: Like Isil murderers, far-Right racists want to destroy our pluralistic societiesWe should not fear \u0026#39editing\u0026#39 embryos to enhance human intelligence, says leading geneticist George ChurchComment: I feel for Theresa May – losing one\u0026#39s voice is like going through pubertyComment: Can we please stop garlanding children for being wrong?New Zealand massacre victims: Afghan refugee viewed country as \u0026#39slice of paradise\u0026#39Smart meters with switching problems still being installed in homes after deadlineMan dies in stabbing after fight in south-west London\u0026#39End of innocence\u0026#39: How world reacted to New Zealand terror attackComic Relief 2019: A tear-jerking Four Weddings sequel, David Beckham with jokes and just a flash of a sonic screwdriverNew Zealand mosque shootings: everything we know so far about the Christchurch attacksAmal Clooney joins forces with Prince Charles for award for unsung young womenOne Red Nose Day and a Wedding, review: Comic Relief Four Weddings centerpiece was a clumsy comedy of manners that never quite came offWatercress growers plan trendy makeover as Millennials are snubbing it New Zealand massacre: Tech giants told \u0026#39enough is enough\u0026#39 after shooting live-streamed in social media terror attackWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 16 march 2019","story":"HMS Argyll returns home to Devonport, England.

It also established a website in which it said Apple was not being fair, keeping too much of the revenues from its subscribers for itself and banning Spotify\u0026nbspfrom launching new products.Spotify pointed to the 30 per cent tax that Apple charges on any purchases made through its own systems, arguing that cost should be reduced. It also suggested that Apple had banned it from launching new features, such as an Apple Watch app.In response, Apple has accused Spotify of wrapping financial motivations in misleading rhetoric, and that the company would not be the business it is today without the App Store.After using the App Store for years to dramatically grow their business, Spotify seeks to keep all the benefits of the App Store ecosystem - including the substantial revenue that they draw from the App Store\u0027s customers - without making any contributions to that marketplace, Apple\u0027s statement said.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

Spotify is asking for that number to be zero.Let\u0027s be clear about what that means, Apple\u0027s statement continued.Apple also dismissed Spotify claims that it had blocked access to products and app upgrades, such as around voice assistant Siri and Apple Watch integration.Apple labelled those accusations surprising.In a blog post outlining his company\u0027s position, Spotify chief executive Daniel Ek said Apple\u0027s rules were designed to purposely limit choice and stifle innovation at the expense of the user experience.We aren\u0027t seeking special treatment, he wrote.We simply want the same treatment as numerous other apps on the App Store, like Uber or Deliveroo, who aren\u0027t subject to the Apple tax and therefore don\u0027t have the same restrictions.He argued that the company was left with technical and experience-limiting restrictions imposed on it that stifled its ability to communicate with customers if they chose not to use Apple\u0027s payment system.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No deferral looks likely and the accompanying written ministerial statement refers to a consultation on the detailed design and implementation.”Large companies taking advantage of smaller ones by taking months to make payments will also face tougher rules. Big firms will have to review and report on their payment practices annually in the first step of a crackdown.The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) cheered the move aimed at\u0026nbsppreventing\u0026nbspthe “rife and pernicious” practice.“The UK’s late payment crisis destroys thousands of businesses every year,” said FSB national chairman Mike Cherry.\u0026nbsp“The commitment from the chancellor that the business secretary will see this through is welcome, and we are especially pleased that the first measure has been announced – to make a non-executive director responsible for the supply chain through the audit committee of every large business, and to report back through the annual report on their progress.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It is damaging our economy and it is damaging our standing and reputation in the world,” he said.Mr Hammond, who has hinted he could resign if the UK crashes out of the EU, told the Commons that MPs have the choice to remove the threat of an “imminent no-deal exit”.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersMPs\u0026nbsphave the chance to map out the way forward to a deal that can be collectively supported, Mr Hammond said.“We have huge opportunities ahead of us he said,” praising\u0026nbspBritain’s universities and technology companies.“We are the fifth largest economy in the world, a proud successful outward-looking nation\u0026nbspwith no boundaries to what we can achieve”.But he warned that\u0026nbsp“leaving with no deal would mean significant disruption... and a smaller and less prosperous economy in the long term than if we leave with a deal.”He made clear that if there was a Brexit deal, he would spend some of the £26.6bn “headroom” he expects to have in the Autumn Budget.\u0026nbspHowever if no deal is voted through he implied that the money would disappear due to a big hit to the economy.Delivering some good news for the chancellor, the Office for Budget responsibility revised up its forecast for wage growth to 3 per cent and Mr Hammond said another 600,000 jobs would be created by 2023.But shadow chancellor John McDonnell attacked\u0026nbspthe chancellor’s record on the economy, jobs and wages.\u0026nbspThe government had broken\u0026nbspthe “historic link between securing a job and taking yourself out of poverty”, he said.The Conservatives have\u0026nbspcreated a “large-scale jobs market of low pay, long hours and precarious work”, he said, adding that average wages are still below where they were ten years ago and 4.5 million children are living in poverty.Business groups reacted with disappointment to Mr Hammond’s speech. Edwin Morgan, interim director general of the Institute of Directors, said: “Warm words and proposed consultations are not enough for businesses at a time when confidence is rock bottom and investment plans are eroding away, and many will find it difficult to tread water until more decisive action at the Autumn Budget.“While a ‘no deal’ would wreak certain havoc for many firms, we must also avoid being lulled into thinking an exit deal alone is a substitute for providing a real economic impetus that lowers costs, spurs productivity growth, and supports businesses as they adjust to Brexit, whatever its form. Indeed, the fact that the OBR lowered its forecast for GDP growth this year – based on a smooth exit from the EU – highlights just how much the economy is set to fall below its potential, even in a relatively benign scenario.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

A street is marked “dark @ night” and another “hangout spot”. The groups are identifying what’s already available in neighbourhoods and what is desirable. It is part of the social action lab, a project with the British Council and the University of Central Lancashire to encourage Preston residents to become more active within their communities by offering them seed funding to develop projects.\u0026nbspThe social action lab, which brings together artists, community activists and residents, is exactly the kind of thing Ruth Heritage hoped to support in Preston when she opened the People’s Production Lab in November 2017. The next step is to turn the many businesses and artists\u0026nbspworking within the Lab into a cooperative, owned and run by the people who work there, to make it sustainable.\u0026nbspThe design secrets of the UK’s biggest cooperativeCould co-operative shops be the answer to expensive organic foods?Preston has become a testing ground for a new way to run a local economy. The “Preston model” is rooted in the development of cooperatives, or businesses owned by workers, rather than shareholders in remote locations looking to extract value with stocks and idends.Cooperative startups have been shown to be more resilient during times of economic stress. While 44 per cent of new businesses survive their early years, 80 per cent of cooperatives go on to thrive, according to a 2018 report on the cooperative economy by Cooperatives UK.\u0026nbspPreston Council has just announced up to £1m in funding to support the development of cooperatives in the area. The funding will come from Preston City Council, the University of Central Lancashire and the Open Society Foundations, which was started by hedge fund billionaire George Soros. It will create 10 new cooperatives, owned and run by workers in Preston, building on the work of community businesses with ambitions to become cooperatives, like the People’s Production Lab and others.\u0026nbsp“We want to provide equitable employment for graduates in the first instance,” says Mark Porter, a senior lecturer in web design at the University of Central Lancashire who is starting a cooperative called Preston Digital Foundation.\u0026nbspMr Porter believes working at the People’s Production Lab will provide the basis for cooperation between cooperatives, one of the seven basic principles of working in this way. “Our next steps are to complete the registration process to get the coop up and running in time for summer and the next cohort of graduates and enable us to start generating revenue.”Heritage started producing and commissioning arts and culture in Preston a decade ago under the name They Eat Culture. She began to imagine a fully-equipped creative space for the people of Preston, where digital businesses and artists could share resources and work together. In 2017, Michael Conlon, the manager of a local construction firm, suggested Heritage take on the multi-storey building at 55 Guildhall Street in the town centre. The building, previously used as offices by Lancashire County Council, had been empty since the departure of a faith school.\u0026nbspWithin a year, Heritage and They Eat Culture have transformed the commercial building into creative spaces. Peering through the windows, I see white walls of former corporate spaces\u0026nbspfilled with equipment for a\u0026nbspwood shop and tool library, a co-working space with desks and chairs donated by a local solicitor, a hack space with 3D printers and a sound studio with a green screen for video work. Art hangs from a washing line from the ceiling of one of the offices\u0026nbsp– now a screen printing studio. In the hallway, Heritage gets inside a makeshift photo-booth that went on tour with accompanying interview cards saying “talk to me about crime” and “talk to me about loneliness”.“There are artists studios and shared spaces in Preston, but we’re trying to evolve a way of creating shared facilities that people can use rather than inidual spaces,” Heritage says.Anthony King runs a startup screen printing studio called Priestown Press from the People’s Production Lab. “I was out of work for quite a while after some surgery,” King says. “My wife suggested I get back into art. The Lab has allowed us to expand and have the space to be artists. It’s subsidised, so it’s beneficial for artists who are struggling. There aren’t that many in Preston.”Priestown Press prints garments for street artists in Preston and London. Through the social action lab, King has been working on turning the studio into a community resource and a place for art therapy.\u0026nbsp“It’s evolving into a social enterprise,” King says. “Especially for mental health, art can be very therapeutic. Suicide is on the rise among men and younger people, so if we can do projects that get kids doing things, rather than keeping themselves to themselves, then it can only help.”Tom Stables is the chair of Digital Lancashire, a non-profit organisation that supports the digital economy in Lancashire. Stables says the area is already home to multiple agencies, software houses and creative enterprises. Digital Lancashire has worked with accountants and TV companies, helping them develop their digital clientele and acquire funding to expand.\u0026nbspStables is considering basing Digital Lancashire within the People’s Production Lab where it can nurture partnerships with other businesses. “Having the People’s Production Lab on our doorstep is terrific,” he says. “As well as being a place that our board meet, a number of our members have the space to grow and thrive.”Heritage talks breathlessly of plans for live storytelling projects, comedy programmes developing new talent, a community culture guide and a vegan pop-up experience. “I want there to be a lot of action on the ground,” she says. “Preston has been held back by being off the beaten track and by not having relationships with central government but the tide is turning. The time is now.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Big firms will have to review and report on their payment practices annually in the first step of a crackdown.The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) cheered the move aimed at\u0026nbsppreventing\u0026nbspthe “rife and pernicious” practice.“The UK’s late payment crisis destroys thousands of businesses every year,” said FSB national chairman Mike Cherry.\u0026nbsp“The commitment from the chancellor that the business secretary will see this through is welcome, and we are especially pleased that the first measure has been announced – to make a non-executive director responsible for the supply chain through the audit committee of every large business, and to report back through the annual report on their progress.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It is damaging our economy and it is damaging our standing and reputation in the world,” he said.Mr Hammond, who has hinted he could resign if the UK crashes out of the EU, told the Commons that MPs have the choice to remove the threat of an “imminent no-deal exit”.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersMPs\u0026nbsphave the chance to map out the way forward to a deal that can be collectively supported, Mr Hammond said.“We have huge opportunities ahead of us he said,” praising\u0026nbspBritain’s universities and technology companies.“We are the fifth largest economy in the world, a proud successful outward-looking nation\u0026nbspwith no boundaries to what we can achieve”.But he warned that\u0026nbsp“leaving with no deal would mean significant disruption... and a smaller and less prosperous economy in the long term than if we leave with a deal.”He made clear that if there was a Brexit deal, he would spend some of the £26.6bn “headroom” he expects to have in the Autumn Budget.\u0026nbspHowever if no deal is voted through he implied that the money would disappear due to a big hit to the economy.Delivering some good news for the chancellor, the Office for Budget responsibility revised up its forecast for wage growth to 3 per cent and Mr Hammond said another 600,000 jobs would be created by 2023.But shadow chancellor John McDonnell attacked\u0026nbspthe chancellor’s record on the economy, jobs and wages.\u0026nbspThe government had broken\u0026nbspthe “historic link between securing a job and taking yourself out of poverty”, he said.The Conservatives have\u0026nbspcreated a “large-scale jobs market of low pay, long hours and precarious work”, he said, adding that average wages are still below where they were ten years ago and 4.5 million children are living in poverty.Business groups reacted with disappointment to Mr Hammond’s speech. Edwin Morgan, interim director general of the Institute of Directors, said: “Warm words and proposed consultations are not enough for businesses at a time when confidence is rock bottom and investment plans are eroding away, and many will find it difficult to tread water until more decisive action at the Autumn Budget.“While a ‘no deal’ would wreak certain havoc for many firms, we must also avoid being lulled into thinking an exit deal alone is a substitute for providing a real economic impetus that lowers costs, spurs productivity growth, and supports businesses as they adjust to Brexit, whatever its form. Indeed, the fact that the OBR lowered its forecast for GDP growth this year – based on a smooth exit from the EU – highlights just how much the economy is set to fall below its potential, even in a relatively benign scenario.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Where new vehicles sold for use on British roads don’t conform to emissions standards, DVSA will work with other government agencies and manufacturers to ensure the vehicles are fixed as quickly as possible.”Concerns about vehicle emissions have grown since the Volkswagen diesel scandal emerged in September 2015.The German carmaker agreed to pay a €1bn (£880m) fine in Germany last year after it was revealed to have cheated tests on diesel engines in the US and Europe.In January, JLR announced it would cut 4,500 jobs to make £2.5bn of cost savings.

Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), will question whether a system where 16-year-olds\u0026nbspsit\u0026nbspmore than 30 hours of exams is “necessary”.Addressing more than 1,000 headteachers at the union’s conference in Birmingham, Mr Barton will highlight that a third of pupils every year are deemed to have failed under the government’s exam reforms. It comes after ASCL published a report looking into the pupils who fail to achieve at least a grade 4, the government’s new “standard pass” which has replaced the C grade, in GCSE English and maths. The report questions whether students should have to continue to resit English and maths GCSEs post-16 – a current government requirement – if they do not achieve a pass, saying there is evidence the policy is not working and “is a significant waste of student potential and teachers’ resources.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Schoolchildren gather around Queen Victoria Memorial at Buckingham Palace as they take part in a student climate protest in London.

With only two months to go until the UK is scheduled to leave the EU, people attended the rally to listen to speakers as they called for Brexit to be halted and for a second people’s vote to take place.Former engineers Derek Mack (left) and Mike Kelloway, both from the Isle of Wight, inside the remains of the Black Arrow projectile, the UK\u0027s only rocket to successfully launch a satellite into orbit, are unveiled at a storage facility in Penicuik, near Edinburgh, after almost 50 years languishing in the Australian OutbackMr Barton will say: “What are we as a nation saying to a young person who after 12 years of being taught by teachers through early years, primary and secondary education, gets a grade 3 and then two years of mandatory resits. Why do we insist in rubbing their noses in disappointment?“Last summer, there were nearly 190,000 children who didn’t achieve at least a grade 4 in English and maths. This year, because of the way our examination system works – determined not to allow accusations of grade inflation – there will be a similar number.”The school leaders’ union head will also question whether too much pressure is being placed upon the GCSE system in general, adding that the qualification is “buckling under the weight of expectations”.He will add: “We use it to judge the child, the cohort, the teacher, the head, and the school. And in the process of reform, we’ve ended up with a system in which the average 16-year-old is sitting more than 30 hours of exams. “How can that possibly be necessary, given the GCSE should chiefly be there to help a young person make the right choice in post-16 progression?”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We have reformed GCSEs to equip pupils with the knowledge and skills they need to prepare for their future. These new, gold standard GCSEs are regulated by the independent qualifications regulator, Ofqual, to ensure their rigour and quality. “To support teachers and provide stability as these improved qualifications bed in, the education secretary has committed there would be no further changes to the national curriculum and no more reform of GCSEs beyond changes already announced for the rest of this parliament.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 418 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.518 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1318 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1418 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.1718 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in.

With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1318 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1418 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.1718 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Her next album,\u0026nbspIn My Defense, is expected to follow later this year.It will be the first record released by Azalea since she left her previous label, Island Records, last year.\u0026nbspThe rapper has since signed a multi-year agreement with Empire Distribution, announcing in a statement at the time:\u0026nbsp“The ability to have control of my own artistic future is a long awaited and monumental change in my life.“I genuinely feel I am in the best position to achieve my creative ambitions.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But with a filmmaking history that goes back further than Hollywood, the city is having the last laugh, says David BarnettClick to followThe IndependentThe 1959 classic ‘Room at the Top’ was shot in BradfordIn the spring of 2009, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation prepared to announce where in the world would become the very first place to be designated City of Film.\u0026nbspWho would scoop this prestigious Unesco honour? Surely Los Angeles, whose Hollywood district is synonymous with film itself, was leading the field. Cannes, perhaps, or Venice, home of the world’s most glittering film festivals.When the announcement came in June of that year, there was a collective, rather nonplussed pause. The first ever Unesco City of Film would be… Bradford, in West Yorkshire.A decade ago, Bradford was rarely in the news for the right reasons. The riots of eight years previously were still being picked over and analysed as the city often found itself pitched as some kind of race relations battleground. The far-right British National Party had been making gains on the council for a couple of years\u0026nbspand in 2010 the English Defence League would build up to a massive rally there. The global recession and subsequent credit crunch had hit Bradford particularly hard, evidenced by a huge hole in the city centre, where blocks of old shops had been demolished to make way for a shiny new shopping centre that was mothballed for years before a brick had even been laid due to the country being plunged into austerity.On the face of it, there was no earthly reason why Unesco should choose Bradford, save perhaps pity. And that’s something that still rankles slightly with David Wilson, the director of Bradford City of Film.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Best films of 2019 (so far) Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief.

No one really realised it at the time, but Bradford was the perfect choice.”In fact, Bradford’s association with films goes back further than Hollywood’s. A Bradford man called Richard Appleton was dubbed the “First Knight of the Camera” for his pioneering work with film. In 1897, he shot footage of Queen Victoria’s diamond jubilee celebrations\u0026nbspand processed it in an ad-hoc darkroom set up on the train from London to his hometown, just in time to show it to aghast audiences in Bradford city centre. Hollywood didn’t start producing movies for at least another decade.Not long after that, a studio was set up in the city that began turning out the adventures of one Captain Kettle, short films that\u0026nbspproved immensely popular in the turn-of-the-century years that formed the infancy of film.Filmed in Yorkshire: Is the county becoming the Hollywood of the UK?Wilson vividly remembers the first time he made the connection between Bradford and the world of film when as a young man a friend persuaded him to go to watch a showing of the 1963 classic Billy Liar at the Bradford Playhouse. He confesses, “I couldn’t understand why I was there, why I’d been dragged to see this old film. And then I realised that it was Bradford up on that screen. It was something of a transformative experience.”Billy Liar was by no means the only movie to be shot in Bradford. Filmmakers were attracted by its sweeping Victorian architecture, a hangover from the days when wool trading made Bradford one of the richest cities in the world, and the stunning countryside all around. The old grandeur and natural beauty were counterpointed by a modernist, northern vibe that made it perfect for movies such as\u0026nbspRoom at the Top (1959) and its 1965 successor Life at the Top. The railway tracks that cleaved through the valley that had Keighley at one end and Haworth at the other was the perfect setting for The Railway Children in 1970.They shot Yanks in Bradford, A Private Function, The Dresser. There have been at least two adaptations of Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights, shot on the very hills that inspired the novel. And the bleak 1980s sex comedy Rita, Sue and Bob Too was filmed all around Bradford’s most deprived areas, places lived in by the tragic playwright Andrea Dunbar who drew upon her own life for the you-have-to-laugh-or-you’ll-cry story of hope amid hopelessness.Bradford has also had for a long time a major boon in the shape of what was once called the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, then changed its name to the National Media Museum, and is now called the National Science and Media Museum. Owned by the Science Museum Group, it is\u0026nbspa massively successful tourist attraction that encompasses all kinds of media, especially the internet. The museum had also for many years hosted the Bradford International Film Festival, which brought in big-name actors and filmmakers from across the world though, in a fairly ironic move, this was scaled down and then ultimately axed in the wake of the City of Film award.Peake-starring\u0026nbsp‘Funny Cow’ was shot in the city (David Barnett)Also, crucially, when Bradford put its bid in back in 2008 for the Unesco designation, it had a champion in the shape of director and producer Lord David Puttnam, along with homegrown talent Simon Beaufoy, who wrote the screenplay for Slumdog Millionaire, which that year scooped 11 Oscars, and Steve Abbott, who produced Brassed Off and A Fish Called Wanda.So, despite the naysayers, Bradford had a pretty good pedigree for winning the City of Film award. The question has to be asked, though, in true Monty Python style – and, fact fans, the musical number “Every Sperm is Sacred” in the Pythons’ 1983 movie The Meaning of Life was shot at the city’s Cartwright Hall – what has the Unesco City of Film ever done for us?The answer is, actually, quite a lot as far as Bradford is concerned. It’s true that in the first couple of years after winning the designation, not a great deal seemed to happen. That was perhaps because while Unesco granted the appellation City of Film, it didn’t actually come with a penny of funding. And given the time it happened, there wasn’t exactly a lot of money swilling about in the local authority coffers to do a great deal about it.David Wilson was brought in as director of the City of Film in 2011. He had previously worked for Bradford Council in a music development role. He was quite literally shown an empty office and wished good luck.It would have been reasonably easy for Bradford to merely take the accolade, put up a few banners and maybe stick a logo on official notepaper (though Unesco can, of course, withdraw designations any time they think they aren’t deserved). But David Wilson knew that being City of Film could pay great idends for Bradford.“The first thing I did was reopen the film office,” he says. Ever since watching Billy Liar he had been acutely aware of the attraction of the district to filmmakers, and though there had been an active office in the 1980s, trying to bring film and TV producers to the area, that had fallen by the wayside. It immediately began to pay idends, as the efforts of the City of Film team began to aggressively market Bradford to the industry\u0026nbspand the industry began to take notice.In 2018, 35 films and TV shows were shot in Bradford, including Peaky Blinders, which has shot most of its five seasons in the district, and ITV’s Victoria, which soon starts its next season. Movies such as the Maxine Peake film\u0026nbspFunny Cow were shot in the city, as well as Ghost Stories, based on the hit stage show by Andy Nyman and Jeremy Dyson. Dyson, one quarter of The League of Gentlemen team, lives in Ilkley, part of the Bradford district. Official Secrets, a movie starring Keira Knightley, was filmed at Bradford’s imposing City Hall (in its bowels are old courtrooms that have proved a popular location for years, especially for Coronation Street), which goes on release later this year. And scenes in the forthcoming Downton Abbey movie have been filmed in Bradford.The City of Film has even brought in many Bollywood productions to film in Bradford, most notably the hit movie Gold. Wilson is constantly trying to drive home to local businesses that they can capitalise massively on such productions. When the Gold team went to Bradford, they used local crew, offices and extras and booked the equivalent of 4,000 hotel overnight stays over a three-month period.Bradford’s City of Film success has happened at the same time as the rise of Screen Yorkshire, one of the country’s most successful regional film offices that is responsible for encouraging investment in the Yorkshire and Humber region. Screen Yorkshire helps bring on local businesses working in the film and TV industries\u0026nbspand markets the region to filmmakers from across the world. According to Office for National Statistics figures, the screen industries in Yorkshire and the Humber grew faster than anywhere else in the country, including London and the southeast, between 2009 and 2015.In its 10th anniversary year, the Bradford City of Film is more successful than even Wilson could have envisaged when he first took over the running of the office. It now works out of a couple of rooms at the University of Bradford\u0026nbspand is still not a massive operation – it comprises Wilson, two part-time staff\u0026nbspand a couple of freelancers. Money is still not flowing in, but it’s testimony to the drive of the team, Wilson, especially, that it’s been such a success.He says:\u0026nbsp“I’m proud of what we’ve achieved.” Wouldn’t it be nice to get more funding locally, though? He says carefully:\u0026nbsp“There has perhaps been a lack of understanding about what it is we do and what benefits it can bring.”Bradford is now well and truly on the map for the TV and film industry, but that’s only a part of what the City of Film office does and perhaps, suggests Wilson, not necessarily the most important aspect.“It’s nice to have all the red carpet stuff, of course it is,” he says. “But it was always the idea that City of Film would bring benefits to\u0026nbspand give a voice to\u0026nbspthe local communities of Bradford.”One of the big projects for 2019 is encouraging and facilitating the rise of community cinemas. Films are shown in village halls, community centres, churches, with perhaps surprising results. Wilson says: “Obviously we’re not trying to take people away from actual cinemas, but instead we’re bringing communities together. People who might have just nodded to each other on the street have become friends. And there’s a cross-generational benefit, younger and older people mixing. They watch films for entertainment, of course they do, but we also encourage them to show perhaps more challenging films, about which they can talk.”It’s also about enabling communities to get involved and get their voices heard – recently the City of Film helped a group of Sudanese women who had fled the genocide in Darfur make a film about their lives in Bradford.And there’s a strong focus on giving people from communities that might not historically have had much truck with the film industry the chance to realise their ambitions and recognise that there might well be a role for them in the world of film and TV.\u0026nbsp“Most people just look at the names of the actors in the credits, maybe the producer or director on occasion,” says Wilson. “But there are hundreds of names in those closing credits of people involved in all aspects of making a film, from sound technology to catering, and we’re trying to get people to think about being a part of that. We want to inspire and empower them to think that yes, they could do that.”Indeed, in September the City of Film presents the Get Smart Film Festival, dedicated to showing short films made entirely on smartphones, which they’re hoping as many people from the Bradford area get involved with as possible. “The technology to make films is literally in people’s hands now,” says Wilson. “We want to show them that anything is possible.”Later this month Bradford hosts the International Film Education Symposium, welcoming experts from across the globe to talk about improving access to all strands of media, and in May Channel 4 brings its Diverse Festival – previously only held in London and Glasgow – to the city to thrash out how to make the industry more inclusive.Netflix announces third ‘A Christmas Prince’ film with royal babyCafé roof filmed collapsing seconds after man walked past itThe 20 best food scenes in filmSamuel L Jackson picks his four favourite Marvel filmsAnyone interested in a career in film or TV is in a very strong position Channel 4 is moving up to neighbouring Leeds and Screen Yorkshire has recently opened a vast, dedicated sound-stage studio on a former airfield in the region. “I keep telling young people especially, this is their time to shine,” says Wilson.Bradford is leading the world as the first City of Film – quite literally. Since 2009, Unesco has designated several further City of Films, including Santos in Brazil, Lodz in Poland, Busan in South Korea\u0026nbspand Bristol here in the UK. The Bradford office has helped and advised and worked with all these places to achieve their designation.It’s been a busy and often exhausting 10 years, but Wilson is already looking to the next decade\u0026nbspand he’s no doubt where the opportunities lie. Wilson has been out to Qingdao – China’s Hollywood – three or four times already, and has forged close links with the Chinese film industry. So much so, that as a direct result of the close relationship, a Chinese adaptation of Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre is in the planning stages.It’s very exciting times. Wilson says:\u0026nbsp“I’m hoping that this year really builds on all the progress we’ve made since 2009, and that we’ve put the measures in place to make Bradford City of Film sustainable for at least the next 10 years.”For more information on the programme of 10th-anniversary events, go to bradfordcityoffilmWe’ll tell you what’s true.

I remember the campaign well because it was the subject of an article I was producing for a university magazine, the first I ever wrote for any publication.The election was considered particularly\u0026nbspimportant because the Northern Irish prime minister, Terence O’Neill, was seeking endorsement of his policy of moving towards granting civil and political rights to the Catholic minority – a policy over which his own unionist party was split.I had a sense early on that it was already too late for compromise because institutionalised anti-Catholic discrimination had cut too deep for change to come without violence.There were signs of this in the villages and small towns around the lakes of Fermanagh. I was following the campaign of a Catholic candidate who held progressive opinions. One evening we saw a group of men standing beside the road and he made a short speech denouncing the unionist establishment. After he had finished, one of the men said that the candidate had no need to worry “because nobody here is going to vote for a Protestant”.Like many appeals to the moderate centre in Northern Ireland over the past half century, O’Neill’s did less well than many expected. The prime minister said he had received 150,000 letters supporting political compromise, but these failed to turn into enough votes on election day to give him the mandate he needed.Derry Girls has created a joyous and complex identity for N IrelandHe won only a slim majority among pro-reform unionist MPs and was humiliated when he almost lost his seat in Bannside to the virulently anti-Catholic preacher Ian Paisley, who was just gaining prominence in Northern Irish politics. O’Neill resigned as prime minister a few months later and Paisley went on to win the seat in the next election in 1970 as the candidate for the Protestant Unionist Party, which soon afterwards changed its name to the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).Half a century later many things have changed in the world, from the fall of the Soviet Union to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that followed 911, but the DUP is very much the same today as it was then.The only (big) difference is that it is no longer a fringe party but one that provides the essential parliamentary support to keep the British government in power. Its views are eagerly and respectfully sought by politicians and media alike as to the terms under which Britain should leave the EU, seemingly ignoring that the DUP agenda is very different from that of the Conservative Party and other Brexit supporters.One of the many extraordinary things about Britain in the age of Brexit is that the nature and history of the DUP is not more closely examined. On the other hand, it is in keeping with a tradition in Britain of proud ignorance of Irish politics north and south as something not worth considering. This despite the fact that the fate of the Northern Irish backstop is a lead item in newscasts and at the centre of the most important decision in UK history since the Second World War. Tony Blair was one of the only British leaders to know much about Northern Ireland, which explains why he was able to negotiate the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) in 1998 that ended three decades of fighting. \u0026nbspPaisley mellowed in his last years, becoming first minister of the Northern Ireland Executive in 2007, but the DUP changed less than he did and remains closer to the uncompromising and sectarian views that he espoused for most of his career. Once he was asked about building bridges between the Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland and his reply explains much about the DUP’s approach today. “Where do bridges go?” he asked rhetorically and gave the classic response, damning in his eyes, that “they go over to the other side”.There is strong evidence that the DUP leader Arlene Foster, who opposed the GFA as a member of the Ulster Unionist Party before joining the DUP, still thinks along these lines. Asked in 2017 why she had not compromised with Sinn Fein, the dominant Catholic and nationalist party and her partner in the power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive, she replied: “If you feed a crocodile it will keep coming back and looking for more.”She later expressed regret for the crocodile comparison but her record in office appeared to back up her words in the eyes of Catholics, who now make up half the 1.9 million population of Northern Ireland.DUP tells May not to ‘roll over’ to the EU in fresh warningLater the same year, Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority in the general election and reached a confidence and supply agreement with the DUP. This came with a £1bn subsidy for Northern Ireland in addition to the usual UK annual grant of £11bn a year.It was an extraordinary piece of luck for the DUP, though perhaps less lucky for the UK as whole, that the party should hold the balance of power at such a critical moment, though its beliefs had changed little since the first years of the Troubles.Dr John Kyle, a councillor for the Progressive Unionist Party on Belfast City Council and GP in the Protestant heartland of east Belfast, has had a close-up view of the DUP in action over many decades.He says: “The DUP remains socially conservative, politically right wing, strongly sectarian, very pragmatic, tough negotiators and always reluctant to change.” He adds that the central ground in Northern Irish politics remains sparsely inhabited because of the polarisation which has been exacerbated by Brexit.The DUP is much more like the Republican Party in the southern states of the US, with its backbone of fundamentalist evangelical Christians, than it is like other British political partiesGiven its undoubted influence in Westminster, the DUP has no need to share power with anybody in Northern Ireland and is likely to do even better than before in the next election there.Yet the DUP remains a stranger movement than most people notice when watching its MPs being interviewed by the British media. At its core are two highly sectarian and regressive organisations: the Free Presbyterian Church, founded by Ian Paisley in 1951, and the Orange Order.Three in 10 (30.5 per cent) of the DUP membership belong to the Free Presbyterians according to The Democratic Unionist Party: From Protest to Power by Jonathan Tonge, Maire Braniff and others, who interviewed three-quarters of the party’s members. This is a high proportion of the DUP given that there are only 10,068 Free Presbyterians, who make up 0.6 per cent of the Northern Irish population.Belonging to the Orange Order is the other feature which distinguishes the DUP, with 34.6 per cent of members belonging to an organisation whose determination to parade through Catholic areas has frequently provoked sectarian violence in the past (though much reduced today by the rerouting or banning of parades going through sensitive areas).The DUP is thus much more like the Republican Party in the southern states of the US, with its backbone of fundamentalist evangelical Christians, than it is like other British political parties. Its social policies on issues like abortion are regressive and it has a tradition of homophobia that has not changed since Ian Paisley led the “Save Ulster from Sodomy” campaign in 1977.The fortuitous political triumph of the DUP comes at the moment when the Protestant and unionist community is on the retreat socially and demographicallyLord Patten, the former Conservative Party chairman and EU commissioner, who is one of the few British political leaders with knowledge of Northern Ireland, is quoted as saying in a newspaper interview this week that Theresa May’s deal with the DUP in 2017 was “a huge mistake”. He believes that the British government has “compromised its balanced position on Northern Ireland in order to get into bed with the DUP”.The DUP denies that it wants a hard border, which would be economically devastating for many of the businessmen and farmers who vote for the party. But it is widely suspected in Northern Ireland that this is not true and that at heart the party does want a hard border iding Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic because this would be a death blow to the Good Friday Agreement. Foster said last October that the agreement was not “sacrosanct” and could be changed in order to take account of Brexit.“The DUP were never in favour of the GFA,” says Morris, arguing that there is nothing surprising about the party’s hostility to the Good Friday Agreement. “They voted against it at the time. Why should they protect it now? It was meant to have fairly similar nationalists and unionist forming a government. But the DUP and Sinn Fein disagree on almost every economic and social policy. They don’t even agree what to call the place: Sinn Fein still calls it the North and the DUP Northern Ireland.”Surprisingly Sinn Fein leaders do not sound concerned about the DUP’s predominance, arguing that it is only temporary and will end as soon as the DUP no longer holds the balance of power in Westminster. There may be an element of wishful thinking in this and political parties all like to imagine that the successes of their opponents are Pyrrhic victories. But Lord Patten argues that the DUP does “more for Sinn Fein than Sinn Fein does by undermining confidence in the existing economic and political relationships between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, Europe and the Republic of Ireland”.The Catholic community is relying on another long-term factor which it believes will negate any tactical gains made by the DUP. Their numbers are growing faster than the Protestants and they will be in the majority by 2021, which is coincidentally the hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the Northern Irish state.Of equal importance is that the Catholic community is becoming more prosperous and better educated than the Protestants. Once it was the Catholics who worked in menial jobs and had twice the unemployment rate of Protestants – 18 per cent compared to 9 per cent in 1972 – but this gap has disappeared. The Catholic middle class was the great beneficiary of the peace process and Catholics make up 60 per cent of those in higher education.Karen Bradley’s ‘mistake’ reveals far more than just her ignoranceQueens University in Belfast is increasingly seen as a “green” institution, while Protestants often go to Scottish or English universities and many do not return after graduating. Catholics increasingly dominate professions like law, medicine, and accountancy.“The professional classes are increasingly populated by the nationalist community,” says Dr Kyle, adding that young working-class Protestants in east Belfast would historically have gone into the shipyards and worked as welders, painters, plumbers – heavy industrial jobs which have now disappeared. Ironically, Catholics were less vulnerable to de-industrialisation because discrimination had prevented them getting the industrial jobs that have now disappeared. \u0026nbspMorris recounts her own family background to illustrate this trend: “My mother was a cleaner, she had eight children my father was mainly unemployed because of the Troubles. She was pulled out of school when she was 14 to mind the other children, but she was obsessed with education, as many Catholic families were, and she pushed us all to go to grammar school.”The fortuitous political triumph of the DUP comes at the moment when the Protestant and unionist community is on the retreat socially and demographically.Dr Kyle says that “most unionists would feel that it is only a matter of time before a majority of the population are from nationalist or Republican backgrounds”. He believes that DUP “arrogance and smugness”, and its effort to impose Brexit despite a majority in Northern Ireland being opposed to it (56 to 44 per cent in the referendum in 2016), will be counterproductive because it alienates nationalists and middle-class unionists.The Good Friday Agreement is being undermined by the prospect of a hard border despite its great success as a historic compromise between the two communities. The economic benefits are visible everywhere. politan Belfast, with a population of 600,000, looks more prosperous than many cities in the rest of the UK.It is this success which is now being put at risk. That does not mean there will be a rerun of the Troubles after 1968-69, but it does mean that friction between Catholics and Protestants is on the rise again after falling in recent years.Morris recalls reporting on Orange Order parades around 12 July, usually a peak point in sectarian violence. “I would often return home at four or five in the morning covered in bruises from metal bolts thrown during the parades,” she says. But clashes have become far less frequent and in the last three years, she says: “I have often found myself sitting in a bar with a glass of wine in my hand by seven in the evening.” \u0026nbspThis trend could go into reverse as Brexit pushes up the political temperature in Northern Ireland. The lack of concern and ignorance about what might happen is illustrated by the way in which Brexiteers denounce the backstop as a conspiracy by the EU and the Irish Republic to trap Britain in the customs union rather than as a necessary measure to prevent a hard border which would topple the Good Friday Agreement.The GFA was probably the greatest achievement of the British state over the last half century. The DUP would like to see it go or strip it of any meaning, and it may well succeed. As during the general election of 1969, Northern Ireland is once more at the crossroads.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

The assembly calls on Khan to do “an urgent updating of his carbon reduction targets to make London carbon neutral by 2030”. It is only eleven years to 2030 and transport is Britain’s largest source of greenhouse gas\u0026nbsppollution. There is no time to wait for new technologies to be developed and proven in service.London is already introducing electric buses that charge when stopped, but only on the least demanding routes. The biggest benefits for climate and regional air quality come from switching the longest, fastest and busiest routes to electricity. The good news is that battery trolleybuses are ready to replace diesel buses. Battery trolleybus technology is well proven the system in Rome\u0026nbsphas been in operation since 2005.It is tempting to think that a climate emergency program could see large numbers of new tram lines built quickly. However, most urban roads cover an array of pipes carrying water, sewage, gas, and storm water that have to be accessible for maintenance and repair. (Tearing up tracks every time an underground pipe springs a leak is not much of an option.)It can be very expensive and disruptive to relocate pipes so tram tracks can be built. It is not just the financial cost that needs to be considered, digging up and replacing pipes, and laying heavy concrete beds for steel rails creates pollution. This is where battery trolleybuses could be a game changer. Not only are they cheaper and quicker to introduce, they only need overhead power infrastructure on a fraction of the route.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.Car traffic quickly expands to fill expanded road space in urban areas. And the opposite is also true when you make a car lane into a bus lane traffic disappears. And traffic speeds don’t usually change much. In her 1961 classic The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jane Jacobs wrote about how after the road through Washington Square Park in New York was closed to make it a safer and more pleasant space “cars – just disappeared into thin air”. Traffic did not increase on the surrounding streets as many had predicted. Many similar experiences of disappearing traffic have been documented.Any serious climate action plan must include measures to reduce car travel. And one of the most effective ways to cut vehicle miles travelled (VMT) is to re-allocate road space to anything other than vehicle travel or parking. Creating pedestrian streets, protected bike lanes, tram lines, or bus lanes all reduce VMT and the resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution. But bus lanes for electric buses are an obvious choice in a climate emergency. A well designed bus lane can carry ten times as many people as a lane of cars, and make many polluting automobiles disappear, for a very modest cost.Modern trams are long vehicles with two or more articulated sections. Most of the buses used in bus rapid transit (BRT) lines are similarly articulated or double articulated “bendy buses”\u0026nbspwith capacities of up to 220 people. Double-decker buses, and standard buses, are also used on some BRT lines. New battery trolleybus lines are also being installed for BRT lines. Bus rapid transit utilises bus lanes, typically in the centre of the road, and other features to make bus service faster and more convenient. I recently test rode the BRT line in Castellon, Spain, which is about ten years old. The quiet electric buses run connected to overhead trolley wires on a car-free bus lanes for much of the route, but run off-wire through Castellon’s charming historical centre. A new battery trolleybus BRT line will open in Rimini, Italy later this year.Mayors call for £1.5 billion fund to remove polluting vehicles from UKCities expanding their use of battery trolleybuses include Zurich, Switzerland, which is also expanding its very extensive network of bus lanes – some of which meet BRT standards. After the 1973 oil shock, Zurich\u0026nbspcreated a still unmatched network of exclusive transit lanes and signal priority for both trams and buses. Zurich is building new bus lanes, and improving older ones to get closer to its goal of never having transit passengers delayed by cars. Zurich now has the highest transit ridership in Europe, largely created with cans of paint and cleverly applied electronics controlling traffic lights. And traffic congestion is less of a problem than in most European cities.The climate emergency is far more serious than the oil supply crisis of the 1970s was, and cities like London must more than match Zurich’s past efforts. Lyon, France, is also an interesting example. In recent years Lyon has built and upgraded bus lanes and BRT lines, added trolley wires to new routes, and upgraded to battery trolleybuses with considerable off-wire capabilities. Lyon’s BRT and tram lines complement the metro network in the urban centre, and serve outlying areas that don’t have metro lines.Trolleybus BRT lines are not isolated to Europe. Two of the three BRT lines in Beijing, China, have been converted to operate with battery trolleybuses. And San Francisco is constructing a BRT corridor on an existing trolleybus line. The oldest trolleybus BRT line has been carrying heavy passenger loads since 1995, in Quito, Ecuador. The capacity of BRT lines is similar to tram lines, even though the vehicles tend to be smaller a line with 200 passenger buses arriving every six minutes has more capacity than a line with 300 passenger trams every ten minutes. Since BRT lines are less expensive and quicker to build than other forms of rapid transit, electric BRT is a crucial climate solution – we are in a climate emergency and humanity is running out of time.Electricity is the only energy source up to the jobIn the climate emergency, it is essential to know what really works at the necessary scale. The London mayor’s office touts hydrogen to power buses. Hydrogen cars, trucks and buses have been held up as a solution to the range limitations of battery electric vehicles for decades. But repeated tests of hydrogen transit buses have been dead ends. In my part of the world, the hydrogen bus trial in Whistler, Canada, saw the buses sold off at scrap value after only five years. Moreover, much of the present hydrogen supply is created from natural gas, and the carbon dioxide pollution is released into the atmosphere.Creating hydrogen from renewable electricity is much less efficient and more expensive than using the same electricity in battery trolleybuses, and liquid fuels created by combining hydrogen and carbon are even less efficient. For lighter duty routes, efficient battery buses with stationary charging work fine. A recent report from the Brussels-based Transport \u0026amp Environment (T\u0026ampE) research group, How to decarbonise European transport by 2050, states that: “Given the much lower efficiencies of hydrogen but in particular electrofuels, these are optimally used only where no other alternatives exists.” This report calculates that hydrogen buses use 2.6 times as much energy as battery electric buses. T\u0026ampE’s 2018 report Electric buses arrive on time concludes that “trolley buses with batteries or fast charging e-buses are the preferred solution to address range limitations”.The mayor’s office also promotes biodiesel from waste materials. The supply of truly climate-friendly biodiesel (made from contaminated vegetable oil skimmed from sewer grease traps and the like) is tiny compared to the demand for diesel fuel. Much of the present biodiesel supply comes from food crops, and is more dangerous to climatic stability than conventional oil. And burning food when climate chaos is starting to disrupt agriculture does not seem like a bright idea.Biomethane made from waste organic material can be burnt in natural gas buses. But like biodiesel the climate friendly sources of organic material are extremely limited. Your kitchen scraps and left over chips don’t produce much biomethane. The limited quantities of biomethane are best used to displace fossil natural gas in uses such as restaurant kitchens. Renewable electricity from wind, solar and other sources is rapidly becoming less expensive – and it can be scaled up quickly. Transport for London is already working to purchase renewable electricity and expand renewable generation in the UK. Biodiesel and biomethane are also not much better for air quality than conventional diesel. Acting on the climate emergency can produce much cleaner air with a switch to electricity.Local air pollution causes thousands of premature deaths every year in the UK, as well as contributing to widespread chronic illness in adults and children. All fossil fuel vehicles are more polluting than the manufacturers claim, not just Volkswagen’s diesel machines, though accurate data is tough to come by. Cars, trucks and buses are the most dangerous sources of air pollution since exhaust fumes are released directly onto streets full of people.A few thousand deaths a year pales in comparison to the climate emergency, which threatens the futures of every younger person on the planet. But cleaner air is an important co-benefit of climate action. T\u0026ampE calculates that when noise and air pollution costs are included, electric buses cost about the same as fossil fuel buses. When climate pollution is included, electric buses and bus lanes are a grand bargain.Electric buses for busiest routesBattery trolleybuses charge their batteries off overhead trolley wires while moving, and operate like other battery electric buses off-wire, and can cover at least the same distance in a day as a diesel bus. And the overhead wires only need to cover between one-fifth and two-thirds of the route, so costs are not much more than burning diesel. Modern trolleybus poles connect and disconnect from the wires with a driver operated switch. Reconnecting is done at stops with plastic “rooftops” to guide the connector onto the wire. If the driver has to lower the poles to go around construction, the driver just goes to the next stop that is equipped with “rooftops” and flicks a switch to reconnect.Many more, and better, bus lanes will be needed to meet the aspirations of the climate emergency declaration. A bus crawling along in traffic, or in a so-called bus lane jammed with taxis, does not use much energy. A bus using good quality transit lanes covers much more distance, will attract many more passengers, and will therefore use much more energy. I attended the 6th\u0026nbspinternational e-bus conference in Solingen, Germany, in November and heard how the cities in the best position to quickly shift to electric buses on energy intensive routes are those that already have trolleybus wires in place. “It’s a no brainer\u0026nbsp... To use electric buses which are powered with in motion charging,” said Erik Lenz of Kiepe Electric.Solingen’s transit agency has stopped ordering fossil fuel buses and is using their existing trolley wire network to charge battery trolleybuses. “It is a very efficient system, and that’s why they went for it,” said Lenz. Solingen is aiming for 80 per cent electric buses within four years, and will phase out burning fossil fuels as older buses are replaced. Cities with existing trolleybus wire networks (such as Lyon Vancouver Seattle San Francisco Shanghai Beijing and over 300 other cities around the world) already have powerful charging systems in place for electric buses.Unfortunately, no UK cities kept their trolley bus systems. London and other UK cities switched from electric buses to “modern” diesel buses, and removed their extensive trolley wire networks in the 1950s and 1960s. However, installing new trolley wires to create charging roads is not necessarily more expensive than installing many charging stations for the same number of buses. If the climate emergency declaration is taken seriously, there will be a major investment in charging infrastructure of some kind.Some cities are bringing the trolleybus back. For example Verona, Italy, closed its trolleybus system in 1975 it will have two new battery trolleybus lines in operation by 2021, with off-wire operation in the city centre. Experts from cities such as Berlin and Stockholm told the e-bus conference that different types of electric bus charging systems are required for different transit lines. Overnight charging works for smaller buses that don’t travel far per day. Electric buses that stop and charge at fast chargers can have a role on moderately demanding lines. But the heavy lifting is best done by battery electric trolleybuses, which are the most practical technology for large buses on the busiest and most demanding routes.London council accused of putting ‘lives at risk’ over air pollutionHigh air pollution alert issued for London, Scotland and YorkshireAir pollution puts city residents in bad mood, study suggestsBattery trolleybuses can accelerate and climb hills faster than equivalent diesel buses, so on hilly routes they can be significantly faster. Using other types of electric buses on the most demanding routes would require buying and operating more buses, with each bus driving a shorter distance per day. With larger buses even the most powerful fast chargers often take longer than the time available at end points. This would be impractically expensive in large cities where land to park and charge buses is not readily available.In small cities, larger fleets of electric buses using stationary charging may be a reasonable choice. Regardless of the charging system chosen, the investment needed to switch to electric buses will be considerable. The UK’s contracting system for buses will have to be eliminated or radically changed to make this investment in charging infrastructure possible – private companies are not going to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in charging systems if their contract is up in five years. Letting Margaret Thatcher block climate action from the grave would be a very sad joke.Cities that use a lot of double-decker buses, such as Berlin and London, face an extra challenge in electrifying their fleets. Large double-decker buses weigh a lot when full, and don’t have as many tyres as an equivalent bendy bus. Adding large batteries would cause costly damage to roads, and it may be challenging to fit large batteries into existing bus designs.A promising solution is to add trolley poles to an existing double-decker bus design to allow usage on the most demanding routes if the batteries can be charged while the bus is in motion the batteries can be smaller and lighter. Most historic UK trolleybuses were double-deckers, and there is no obvious obstacle to adding modern trolley poles to a modern electric double-decker bus. On very busy routes, the better option may be to switch to double articulated buses that can carry up to 220 people.Everyone knows that companies make exaggerated claims about their products. Electric bus manufacturers routinely base their claims for how far their electric buses can go between charges on ideal conditions. But real world performance with heavy passenger loads and power-hungry heat or air conditioning operating is a different matter. Unfortunately, the world’s largest manufacturer of electric buses has been reportedly beset by “poor performance” including driving ranges that fall short of company claims in the US, leading disappointed transit agencies to delay the transition off fossil fuels. But transit agencies everywhere can learn from European experience with what each type of electric bus can really do.With battery trolleybuses there is no need to wait around for the battery industry to make improbable technical leaps – while batteries getting cheaper they are still very heavy, and weight will likely still be a big issue a decade from now. T\u0026ampE’s electric bus report suggests increasing the allowable weight for electric buses so they can carry as many passengers as diesel buses. This is reasonable, but the cost of repairing damaged roads needs to be considered when comparing lighter battery trolleybuses to heavier electric buses with larger battery packs.Prices will come downBattery electric buses and battery trolleybuses are now becoming variations of the same product – and prices will come down as a result. Electrical equipment manufacturers ABB and Kiepe Electric both told the e-bus conference participants about how they use the same components in battery electric buses that charge only while stopped, and buses equipped with trolley poles. This means that as the volume of electric buses goes up, prices of all types of electric buses will come down with economies of scale.Trolley:motion, which is funded by the European Union, organised the e-bus conference. Their mission includes improving battery trolleybus technology, and bringing prices down by expanding the number of manufacturers offering trolley charging on their electric buses. Soon, Trolley:motion will be assisting with the conversion of an ordinary battery electric bus to a battery trolleybus capable of operating all day on very demanding routes. If this goes as expected, most bus manufactures should soon offer trolley poles as an option on their electric buses.If big cities, such as Berlin and London, step up and order thousands of battery trolleybuses it will bring prices down globally as the scale of production jumps to a new level. All major bus manufacturers are capable of producing battery trolleybuses, and will respond to demand from big customers. At the United Nations COP 24 climate conference in December, teenage school climate strike organiser Greta Thunberg demanded that adults start taking the climate emergency seriously\u0026nbsp“because we are facing an existential threat and there is no time to continue down this road of madness”. If adults listen to the climate scientists and wise teens, there will soon be many battery trolleybuses gliding quietly down bus lanes in the UK.Eric Doherty is a Victoria BC, Canada-based transportation planning consultant who attended the 6th\u0026nbspinternational e-bus conference\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

sheets across Greenland and Antarctica.At the point where two plates collide, they create mountain ranges containing “sutures” – clear fault lines containing newly exposed rock.Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology realised the emergence of sutures over the course of millennia coincided with the onset of each major ice age.Giant fish washed up dead in Japan raise fear of earthquake or tsunamiThey also found that while some sutures, such as the one located in the Himalayas, had over time moved away from the equator, each one had its origins in the tropics.“We found that every time there was a peak in the suture zone in the tropics, there was a glaciation event,” said Dr Oliver Jagoutz, a geologist at MIT who led the study.“So every time you get, say, 10,000km of sutures in the tropics, you get an ice age.”While the reaction of substances like calcium and magnesium in the rocks with CO2 was the starting point for global cooling, it has also had a role in ending each ice age.Once all the rock that was available to react with the CO2 had been weathered away, it could no longer store any more climate-warming gas, leading to temperatures rising.Despite the planet currently experiencing a relatively icy period, global temperatures are rising as human activity pumps huge volumes of carbon emissions into the atmosphere.While employing the planet’s geology to somehow reverse this process seems like an appealing idea, Dr Jagoutz said it is unlikely to be much help.“The Earth does this in a slow, geological process that has nothing to do with what we do to the Earth today. And it will neither harm us, nor save us,” he said.These results were published in the journal Science.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Parked next to each other, the model numbers spell out S3XY.The release ends a plan that began more than 10 years ago, when Tesla unveiled the Model S.He celebrated the move with a strange tweet on Twitter, posted soon before the car was unveiled at a launch event.Mr Musk has said that he would have liked to have the word written with the E, but that wasn\u0027t possible because Ford opened the copyright to the name.The new all-electric SUV known as the Model Y was unveiled to cheers from a hangar-packed crowd of Tesla customers, employees and members of the media welcomed a blue Model Y as it rolled out onto a stage next to the automaker\u0027s other models.\u0026nbspIt has the functionality of an SUV, but it will ride like a sports car, CEO Elon Musk told the crowd.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe Model Y seats seven and has a panoramic glass roof and a 15-inch (38-centimeter) touchscreen interface for accessing all the car\u0027s controls.\u0026nbspThe all-electric, mid-size SUV will start at $39,000 for the standard range version, which the company said can go 230 miles (370 kilometers) on a single charge. The long-range model, which starts at $47,000, has a range of up to 300 miles (483 kilometers) on a single charge - less range than the Model 3.\u0026nbspA dual-motor, all-wheel drive version of the Model Y starts at $51,000 while the performance version of the car, which boasts acceleration of 0-60 mph (97 kph) in as little as 3.5 seconds and a top speed of up to 150 mph (241 kph), starts at $60,000.The Model Y may be Tesla\u0027s most important product yet as it attempts to expand into the mainstream and generate enough cash to repay massive debts that threaten to topple the Palo Alto, California, company.\u0026nbspTesla got a huge boost toward ensuring its survival with the 2017 debut of its Model 3 sedan, but an SUV could have even more mass appeal, given how popular SUVs have become in the U.S., Europe and Canada.\u0026nbspThe U.S. market share for SUVs, crossovers, vans and pickup trucks stood at 69 percent in January, up from just 48.5 percent a decade ago, according to the research firm IHS Markit.\u0026nbspBut most SUVs still run on gasoline, leaving Tesla to cater to consumers looking for an all-electric alternative. The Model Y\u0027s main competition in this still-nascent market is likely to be the Mercedes-Benz EQC, and to a lesser extent, the Jaguar I-Pace, according to the research firm LMC Automotive.\u0026nbspThis could be Tesla\u0027s most profitable vehicle, with the giant asterisk that the company doesn\u0027t do some of the dumb things it has in the past, said Gartner analyst Mike Ramsey.\u0026nbspMany of Tesla\u0027s past follies have been tied to Musk\u0027s penchants for making grandiose promises that the company hasn\u0027t been able to keep in terms of production, delivery and execution.\u0026nbspProduction of the Model 3 quickly fell behind schedule as Tesla struggled to come up with adequate manufacturing capacity and it took much longer than anticipated to lower the sedan\u0027s starting price to the $35,000 level that Musk had been promoting. Instead, the lowest priced version of the Model 3 had been selling for $43,000 until a couple weeks ago when Tesla reached the promised price point by laying off thousands of workers and imposing other cost-cutting measures.\u0026nbspOverseeing the ramp-up of Model 3\u0027s production nearly drove Musk to exhaustion last year, a factor that may have contributed to a mystifying pattern of behavior that included tweeting about having lined up the financing for a potential buyout of Tesla. That misleading statement jeopardized his job and resulted in a $40 million settlement with stock market regulators.\u0026nbspMusk alluded to the troubled production of the Model 3 during his remarks to the crowd Thursday night.\u0026nbspBecause of extreme challenges with the Model 3 production, we have to basically allocate all resources to Model 3 production, because otherwise we\u0027re going to die, Musk said with a chuckle, eliciting laughs from the crowd.\u0026nbspHe then added: 2018 probably felt like aging five years in one. It was really intense.\u0026nbspTesla expects to deliver the performance, long range, rear-wheel drive and dual-motor, all-wheel drive versions of the Model Y in the fall of 2020. The standard version of the Model Y is expected to roll out in the spring of 2021.\u0026nbspAs with all electric vehicles, the distance that the Model Y can cover on a fully charged battery is likely to be one of its key selling points - or downsides. Teslapegged the Model Y\u0027s range at up to 300 miles compared to 325 miles for the Model 3.\u0026nbspTesla is hoping there will pent-up demand for the Model Y, nearly four years after Musk first began touting the company\u0027s plans to make an SUV. Bringing in early down payments for the vehicles would help Tesla generate the cash it needs to repay nearly $1.7 billion in loans that come due within the next 16 months.\u0026nbspThe company began the year with about $11 billion in debt and $3.7 billion in cash, but those figures presumably fell recently when it repaid about $920 million in bonds.\u0026nbspAnother $566 million in notes are scheduled to be repaid this November followed a $1.1 billion credit line in June 2020.\u0026nbspConsumers who plop down their deposits for the Model Y may have to cross their fingers for their vehicles to be delivered on schedule.\u0026nbspTesla\u0027s recurring production and delivery problems have resulted in consumers having to wait longer than they were originally told.

During the 2016 Brexit referendum, the countryside was seemingly covered in huge billboards, presumably placed there by farmers and landowners, urging a Leave vote.And yet now, as the outraged response from the National Farmers’ Union makes clear, agriculture seems set to be one of the biggest losers from Brexit, especially under the no-deal\u0026nbspscenario currently\u0026nbspunder discussion.Their fear, if not their earlier voting record, is easily explained.On the one hand, much of British farming is protected by the European Union’s common external tariff regime. This is basically an import tax on products such as meat, dairy products, cereals and sugar from the rest of the world, ranging up to almost 40 per cent. It has helped such business survive and prosper, in some cases, and helps to fund the common agricultural policy. From there the money is used to support farm prices and incomes. (Not all types of produce are inside the CAP: for example, apples, cabbages and carrots are excluded.)\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Papers react to the Brexit vote Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch. highlights just how soon the Prime Minister\u0027s defeat has come Britain\u0027s scheduled date of departureThe Daily Mail takes aim at MPs who political editor Jason Groves claims have plunged Britain into chaos by rejecting the Prime Minister\u0027s dealThe Independent calls for a second referendum as a way forwardThe  leads with exasperation, with political editor Macer Hall writing that Brexit was hanging in the balance last nightThe Sun take the Prime Minister\u0027s croaky voice into account as it reports on last night\u0027s Brexit shamblesThe Financial Times claims that the Prime Minister\u0027s authority is in shreds and reports on the fall in the pound in the wake of the voteThe Daily  calls the Prime Minister\u0027s defeat humiliating and claims that a delay to Brexit is likelyThe i claims that parliament is out of controlThe Times claims that Britain is in crisis and that the Prime Minister may face resignation callsThe Daily Mirror says that the Prime Minister surrenders in reference to the likelihood of Brexit being delayed after the vote  highlights just how soon the Prime Minister\u0027s defeat has come Britain\u0027s scheduled date of departureThe Daily Mail takes aim at MPs who political editor Jason Groves claims have plunged Britain into chaos by rejecting the Prime Minister\u0027s dealThe Independent calls for a second referendum as a way forwardThe  leads with exasperation, with political editor Macer Hall writing that Brexit was hanging in the balance last nightThe Sun take the Prime Minister\u0027s croaky voice into account as it reports on last night\u0027s Brexit shamblesThe Financial Times claims that the Prime Minister\u0027s authority is in shreds and reports on the fall in the pound in the wake of the voteThe Daily  calls the Prime Minister\u0027s defeat humiliating and claims that a delay to Brexit is likelyThe i claims that parliament is out of controlThe Times claims that Britain is in crisis and that the Prime Minister may face resignation callsThe Daily Mirror says that the Prime Minister surrenders in reference to the likelihood of Brexit being delayed after the vote Take those EU tariffs away, or reduce them, and those who make their livelihood from, say, wheat crops, will find themselves squeezed or perhaps driven out of business by overseas competition. Cheaper products from the rest of the world – Australia, Argentina, Africa, the US – would soon undercut the British equivalents, leading to lost orders, lower prices, redundancies and bankruptcies.Brands such as Weetabix or McVitie’s can source ingredients such as sugar and grain just as easily from America as, say, East Anglia. Partial government promises about future farming financial support are only of limited comfort – those subsidies may not exist for ever.Brexit plan to slash tariffs after no-deal condemned as ‘madness’On the other side, if the EU were to maintain its existing tariffs and then slap them on British agricultural exports, farmers would find themselves effectively locked out of their close European markets. The EU might also implement costly and time-consuming customs checks on perishable goods and live exports, and require certification under “rules of origin” for the likes of confectionery and frozen meals.Everything from Scottish salmon and Welsh oysters to English beef and frozen cod pie would be badly hit in such conditions.\u0026nbspSo hard Brexit\u0026nbspwould be a colossal double whammy, impoverishing already vulnerable countryside industries in a way not seen since the depression of the early 1930s. For an economist, the argument is a classic example of the consumer interest (cheaper food bought at the lowest possible prices on world markets) being set against the producer interest (maintaining farming incomes).Either way, it is probably not tactful or helpful to remind people in our rural communities that many of them voted for Brexit.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

secure the support of up to 20 Labour MPs for the prime minister’s troubled Brexit deal.Ministers are said to be negotiating with the MPs from Leave-backing seats, as pressure intensifies on Ms May to secure backing for her twice-defeated plan.With just four days to go until the vote, the Labour Brexiteers have demanded that parliament’s right to shape Britain’s future relations with the EU be cemented into law.Attempts to woo the support of\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn’s MPs have so far largely failed, but if efforts succeed then the Labour backing could neutralise an expected rebellion of hardcore Tory Eurosceptic MPs.It comes as senior ministers also held “significant” talks with the Northern Irish DUP in a bid to lock in their support for the big vote on Tuesday, while more Tory MPs came out in support of Ms May’s deal as the clock ticks down to Brexit day on 29 March.Created with Sketch.Papers react to the Brexit vote Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created

and that the Prime Minister may face resignation callsThe Daily Mirror says that the Prime Minister surrenders in reference to the likelihood of Brexit being delayed after the vote Up to now\u0026nbspMs May’s efforts to win over Labour Brexiteers to her deal have fallen short, as her £1.6m fund for Leave-voting towns in England was met with mockery, while a separate package to protect workers’ rights persuaded neither MPs nor trade unions.A handful of Labour MPs are thought to want to be more certain that the deal will pass before publicly backing it, but a second key problem is trust, with others unwilling to accept assurances that a new Tory PM will not ditch promises over employment rights a few months down the line.One Labour MP involved told The Independent: “If we get the assurances we want, then up to 20 Labour MPs could back her when the vote comes back.“And it means that even if she is ousted by her own MPs, then we have those assurances laid down in law.”Labour Leavers want ministers to give legal force to commitments on employment rights and standards that currently sitting in the Brexit political declaration, and also to provide fixed dates on which parliament will be consulted on them.DUP denies ‘cash for votes’ after meeting chancellor over Brexit dealNo deal better than long delay to EU withdrawal, Brexit secretary saysWhat does Brexit mean for the British fashion industry?Why didn’t we go all out for a second referendum on Brexit this week?Another Labour MP said: “Parliament should have an opportunity to be able to express views on all of the different aspects – that was said, it should not be a problem – but it never materialised in writing.“What colleagues were looking for was something much more definitive from the prime minister.”The MP added: “It could be along those lines because that was one aspect that was supposed to be attractive to a number of colleagues.”MPs have overwhelmingly rejected the prime minister’s deal twice – first by 230 votes and then again by 149 on Tuesday – but the PM is hoping one more push could take it over the line.Ms May had called Labour MPs personally ahead of the second vote on her deal on Tuesday, but still suffered a historic defeat, with only three backing the deal.But the potential to win Labour support is clear. For example,\u0026nbsp18 of Mr Corbyn’s MPs defied his will to ensure a second referendum was not backed by parliament this week, five of whom were frontbenchers who later resigned.Mr Corbyn had ordered his MPs to abstain but shadow ministers Yvonne Fovargue, Emma Lewell-Buck and Justin Madders, plus party whip Stephanie Peacock, all voted against the motion and then quit.Stoke-on-Trent North MP Ruth Smeeth, a parliamentary aide to deputy leader Tom Watson, also resigned.Ms Lewell-Buck told her local paper: “If it comes down to either voting for Theresa May’s deal, having no deal or not leaving then I’ll end up voting for her deal, because I’ll be backed into a corner.”Six Labour MPs also helped Ms May block a bid from a cross-party group to strip the government of control of the Brexit process, something which had been expected to pass.On Friday, it emerged that chancellor Philip Hammond is leading government talks with the DUP in a bid to win their support for the deal, prompting speculation there could be financial incentives for the party to back the plan.When the DUP agreed to prop up Ms May’s administration in the Commons after the 2017 election, the party negotiated more than £1.5bn in extra spending for Northern Ireland over 2018-19.Money in the agreement, and potentially the support of the party’s 10 MPs for Ms May, is set to end in June, creating the opportunity for its leader\u0026nbspArlene Foster\u0026nbspto negotiate new terms, with the government’s main ask likely to be safe passage of her\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal.Labour frontbenchers quit after defying Corbyn’s orders on referendumFollowing top level discussions on Friday, which also involved Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, environment secretary Michael Gove and chief whip Julian Smith, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said there had been “a constructive dialogue”.Asked if extra cash for Northern Ireland had been discussed with Philip Hammond, Mr Dodds said: “The chancellor of the exchequer is obviously a key member of the government, but he is also responsible for HMRC and the whole issue of their involvement in customs and other regulatory issues is a key concern for us.”He added: “We are not discussing cash in these discussions.”In a further sign of the weakening opposition from Eurosceptic Tories, Esther McVey, who quit the cabinet over Ms May’s deal, indicated she would now back it.She told BBC Radio 4’s Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast: “The element now is that people will have to take a bad deal rather than no deal.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It is not compatible with WTO rules and it’s the start of a process where they’ll have to get approvals,” he told reporters in Dublin.“If they want to operate on the basis of being in defiance of well-established WTO rules well then that’s their decision. But ultimately that will not succeed because they will be taken to a panel of dispute settlement.”The commissioner, who is Ireland’s member on the EU’s executive, added: “I think the timing of it was unfortunate and it was a deliberate attempt to put Ireland more on the agenda, as if it wasn’t on the agenda already.”Brexit plan to slash tariffs after no deal condemned as ‘madness’He claimed that the “stunt” was an attempt by the UK to “weaken the unity of the EU26 in relation to the Irish backstop”.The UK plan would mean that 82 per cent of imports from the EU would be tariff-free, down from 100 per cent now.Imports from the rest of the world would be 92 per cent tariff-free, up from the current 56 per cent.The WTO’s “most favoured nation” rule, which the UK would have to follow after Brexit, means that countries must treat other WTO members equally in terms of tariffs and quotas, unless they have a recognised free trade agreement in place.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An injured person is loaded into an ambulance following a shooting at the Al Noor mosque in New Zealand.

She had agreed to allow her MPs a free vote on that motion in order to let her ided cabinet ministers vote as they pleased without having to resign.Her hand was forced, however, when backbenchers put forward an amendment calling for a no-deal Brexit to be ruled out at any stage - not just on 29 March.\u0026nbspLabour abandons support for referendum on May\u0027s Brexit dealThat motion narrowly passed, despite the government whipping its MPs to vote against it.The amended motion was then put to another\u0026nbspvote, with Ms May forced into the farcical\u0026nbspsituation of ordering her MPs\u0026nbspto oppose the\u0026nbspmotion - now amended - that she herself had put forward.\u0026nbspBut her efforts were in vain, as MPs backed the proposal by 321 votes to 278 - a majority of 43.Four cabinet ministers - Amber Rudd, David Gauke, Greg Clark and David Mundell - and a handful of junior ministers\u0026nbspignored party orders to vote against the motion and instead\u0026nbspabstained, raising the prospect of them being\u0026nbspsacked.During another evening of dramatic votes in the Commons, MPs also comprehensively rejected a proposal that would have seen the UK leave the EU without an exit deal on 22 May.\u0026nbspSpeaking immediately after suffering her latest Commons setback,\u0026nbspMs May\u0026nbspsaid the government would now bring forward a motion, to be voted on tomorrow,\u0026nbspproposing an extension to the\u0026nbspArticle 50 process.The motion says that if the Commons passes a Brexit deal by 20 March, Brexit will be delayed until the end of June. If no deal is agreed by 20 March, however, the motion suggests that a much longer extension is likely to follow.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersMs May\u0026nbsptold the Commons: If the House finds a way in the coming days to support a deal, it would allow the government to seek a short limited technical extension to Article 50 to provide time to pass the necessary legislation and ratify the agreement we have reached with the EU.But let me be clear: such a short technical extension is only likely to be on offer if we have a deal in place.She continued: Therefore, the House has to understand and accept that, if it is not willing to support a deal in the coming days, and as it is not willing to support leaving without a deal on 29 March, then it is suggesting that there will need to be a much longer extension to Article 50.\u0026nbsp Such an extension would undoubtedly require the United Kingdom to hold European Parliament elections in May 2019.I do not think that would be the right outcome, but the House needs to face up to the consequences of the decisions it has taken.We’ll tell you what’s true.

They fear this is a step towards the breakup of the UK.Talks are said to be focussed on\u0026nbspwhether\u0026nbspMr Cox can find a way to\u0026nbspchange his legal advice to say that there is a way the UK would be able to leave the backstop unilaterally.No deal better than long delay to EU withdrawal, Brexit secretary saysThe good news for Ms May is that the DUP says it wants to support a deal.On Thursday, party leader Arlene Foster said: “We are talking to the government and to the attorney general at the moment to try and make a deal happen because we want to see Brexit working, we want to see it working for the whole of the UK in a way that doesn’t leave Northern Ireland behind.”The prime minister received a further boost on Friday when the DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said his party had held “constructive” talks with several government ministers.He said: “We have had a long series of discussions with a series of cabinet ministers today.“We have had a constructive dialogue. Those discussions will continue over the coming period of time.”DUP denies ‘cash for votes’ after meeting chancellor over Brexit dealThe bad news for Ms May\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspthat the DUP remains\u0026nbspfirmly opposed to the backstop, which is a key part of her withdrawal agreement. The EU has repeatedly insisted that it is not willing to reopen negotiations on the deal.It means that any concessions the government is able to offer the DUP\u0026nbspare likely to relate only to Mr Cox’s interpretation of the legal issues around the backstop, not the backstop itself.The attorney general is reported to be looking at whether the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties –\u0026nbspwhich states that countries can sometimes withdraw from an international\u0026nbsptreaty if there has been\u0026nbsp”a fundamental change of circumstances” – could be used to end the backstop.Ministers could also try to tempt the DUP into supporting the deal\u0026nbspby increasing\u0026nbspfunding for Northern Ireland. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, joined other cabinet ministers in attending talks with the party on Friday, fuelling speculation\u0026nbspthat the government could top up the £1bn it gave to Northern Ireland when the DUP agreed to prop up the Conservatives in the Commons.However, Mr Dodds insisted the party was “not discussing cash in these discussions”.Asked about Mr Hammond’s presence, he said: “The chancellor of the exchequer is obviously a key member of the government, but he is also responsible for HMRC and the whole issue of their involvement in customs and other regulatory issues is a key concern for us.”The DUP has said it hopes to find a way to back Ms May’s deal, but whether or not it is able to do so is ultimately likely to\u0026nbspcome down to Mr Cox’s legal acumen and whether he can somehow find a potential route out of the backstop.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

If the UK is given “Part 2 listed status”, there would be some extra requirements for travelling pets and owners post-Brexit. “These would require an additional visit to the vet and some additional papers to be carried but would not prevent you from enjoying your trip,” says Eurotunnel.

That means there must be at least 90 days (roughly three months) left on your passport beyond your intended date of departure.914 Online registration prior to travel – ETIASFrom 2021, non-EU nationals who do not require a visa to enter the Schengen area – including British travellers – will need to request prior authorisation to visit Schengen countries.A large number of travel providers – even including National Express coaches – have added “Brexit clauses” to their terms and conditions. These generally specify that they will not be liable for “consequential losses” as a result of Brexit-related issues1114 ‘Fast track’ lanes for passport control entering EU countriesBritish passport holders will not be able to use them, and must join the queue for third-country nationals.The ferry industry insists vessels will continue to sail. The UK Chamber of Shipping says: “Unlike the carriage of cargo, trade deals do not have a significant effect on the cruise and passenger ferry industry. The explicit standardisation of commodity codes and tariffs associated with trade deals have little relevance to holidaymakers.”The EU says: “If you fall ill or have an accident during a visit to another EU country, as an EU citizen you have the right to receive the necessary public healthcare in any EU country under the same conditions as people in the host country.” The EHIC also works in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

Buried in a document called Beyond the Horizon: The Future of UK Aviation, the government says “the UK will not fall below current standards of protection when we leave the EU”814 Entry regulations to the European UnionFrom 11pm GMT on 29 March 2019, UK travellers will become “third-country nationals” when travelling to Schengen countries and subject to the standard rules of admission for citizens of nations such as the US, Japan and Australia. That means there must be at least 90 days (roughly three months) left on your passport beyond your intended date of departure.914 Online registration prior to travel – ETIASFrom 2021, non-EU nationals who do not require a visa to enter the Schengen area – including British travellers – will need to request prior authorisation to visit Schengen countries.A large number of travel providers – even including National Express coaches – have added “Brexit clauses” to their terms and conditions.

denied they were behind the Tel Aviv attack, saying the rockets were fired at a time when their officials were\u0026nbspmeeting an Egyptian security delegation to discuss arrangements for the

the country’s military headquarters in Tel Aviv following the rocket fire on Thursday.Ronen Manelis, the Israeli army’s chief spokesperson, said officials had no prior warning of the attack and were trying to pinpoint who was responsible.The Israeli army later released a statement saying\u0026nbspHamas was responsible and posted footage of the attack’s aftermath on its official Twitter account.Army intelligence officials later told The Times of Israel news website that the rockets were fired towards Tel Aviv “by mistake”.\u0026nbsp“Low-level Hamas forces are believed to have been responsible for the launches,” the official said.\u0026nbspEgyptian mediators had been in Gaza, trying to hammer out details of an agreement between militants and Israel.

Likewise, consistently receiving less than you need to because you are paying back an advance can push people over the edge and into destitution.To succeed, Universal Credit needs to raise the incomes of those locked in poverty and ensure that work is a route to a better le. Without further reform, its potential risks being unfulfilled.The best immediate step the Government should take would be to lt the freeze on working age benefits this April.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. JRF also want jobcentres to better use the hidden pot called the Flexible Support Fund to help Brits with their childcare payments upfront so Brits dont go into thousands of pounds of debt going back to work.They highlighted the thoughts of both people on Universal Credit and work coaches in their new report.Research from Britain Thinks revealed that working parents saw Universal Credit as contributing towards their poor standards of living, and not helping them.Many wanted to be able to keep more of their hard-earned cash rather than being hit by the taper rate, and felt trapped by their circumstances.When the couple moved onto the new benefit system in September their £ a month benefits were immediately stopped, leaving them unable to pay their rent.The Peterborough couple, who’ve been living in their current home for a year now, claim they have nowhere  to gothey are evicted and will have to be put in temporary accommodation, at a cost of £ a week to the city council.Its a disgusting situation to be in because you know its going to happen but youre absolutely powerless to do anything about it, Amanda told The Sun.We have no savings, no one to fall back on and we struggle to be able to afford the rent now that we’re in debt.If were are relocated to a completely dferent area then Brian will have to give up his job but I thought the whole point of Universal Credit was to get people into work  It makes no sense.A DWP spokesperson said that the scheme works for the vast majority of people.They added: Universal Credit reduces gradually as people’s income increases, which means they’re always better off in work."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000473357241.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn egged by pro brexit campaigner during visit to mosque","story":"The Labour boss was said to have been hit while on a trip to the Muslim Welfare House and Finsbury Park Mosque in North London on Sunday.Sky News reported that the man is said to be a pro-Brexit protester.John Murphy, , was today charged with assault and will appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates Court on March .Murphy allegedly screamed When you vote you get what you vote for as he came from behind and smacked Mr Corbyn with an egg.Diane Abbott, who was with Mr Corbyn at the time, claimed he punched Jeremy very hard and happened to have an egg in his hand.It is understood the alleged attack was not a regular guest at the mosque.politan Police confirmed an egg was thrown at the member of Parliament on Sunday afternoon.Labour sources confirmed Corbyn was unharmed by the event and continued with his programme of events.He was taking part in the annual Visit My Mosque day with Shadow Home secretary Ms Abbott, visiting two venues in his local area.As he went into one he was given several red roses by fans.Mr Corbyn later tweeted: Every year Muslim communities across the country open their doors to people of all faiths and none on #VisitMyMosque Day. Its a fantastic opportunity to build understanding across communities and educate ourselves about our erse communities. Lets build bridges not walls.The Muslim Welfare House in London released a statement after the incident, saying it the attacker had shouted and hurled verbal abuse to the utter shock and disgust of all present.Toufik Kacimi, CEO of the organisation, said: We condemn in the strongest terms this outrageous act which has left everyone shocked.This disgraceful act by this inidual is a sign of the hatred and Islamophobia that sadly abound in our community.We will not let this deter us from cooperating with all groups in building a more cohesive society.Other Labour figures who have been also hit with an egg include ex-Labour boss Ed Miliband, as well as John Prescott, who went on to punch the protester.Last week Mr Corbyn confirmed that his party would get behind a second Brexit referendum, much to the fury of his pro-Brexit voters.But MPs in Leave backing seats warned it could cost the party their seats - and the next election."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dk-comp-tim-berners.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tim berners lee how to save the world wide web","story":"It is a moment to celebrate how far we have come, but also an opportunity to reflect on how far we have yet to go.The web has become a public square, a library, a doctor’s office, a shop, a school, a design studio, an office, a cinema, a bank, and so much more.Of course, with every new feature, every new website, the ide between those who are online and those who are not increases, making it all the more imperative to make the web available for everyone.And while the web has created opportunity, given marginalised groups a voice and made our daily lives easier, it has also created opportunity for scammers, given a voice to those who spread hatred and made all kinds of crime easier to commit.Against the backdrop of news stories about how the web is misused, it is  understandable that many people feel afraid and unsurethe web is really a force for good. But given how much the web has changed in the past  years, it would be defeatist and unimaginative to assume that the web as we know it can’t be changed for the better in the next .If we give up on building a better web now, then the web will not have failed us. We will have failed the web.To tackle any problem, we must clearly outline and understand it. I broadly see three sources of dys affecting today’s web:The second category requires us to redesign systems in a way that changes incentives.And the final category calls for research to understand existing systems and model possible new ones or tweak those we already have.You can’t just blame one government, one social network or the human spirit. Simplistic narratives risk exhausting our energy as we chase the symptoms of these problems instead of focusing on their root causes. To get this right we will need to come together as a global web community.At pivotal moments, generations before us have stepped up to work together for a better future. With the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, erse groups of people have been able to agree on essential principles.With the Law of the Sea and the Outer Space Treaty, we have preserved new frontiers for the common good.Now too, as the web reshapes our world, we have a responsibility to make sure it is recognised as a human right and built for the public good. This is why the Web Foundation is working with governments, companies and citizens to build a new Contract for the Web.This contract was launched in Lisbon, Portugal, at Web Summit, bringing together a group of people who agree we need to establish clear norms, laws and standards that underpin the web.Those who support it endorse its starting principles and together are working out the specic commit-ments in each area.No one group should do this alone, and all input will be appreciated. Governments, companies and citizens are all contributing, and we aim to have a result later this year.Governments must translate laws and regulations for the digital age. They must ensure markets remain competitive, innovative and open. And they have a responsibility to protect people’s rights and freedoms online.We need open web champions within government — civil servants and elected officials who will take action when private sector interests threaten the public good and who will stand up to protect the open web.Companies must do more to ensure their pursuit of short-term profit is not at the expense of human rights, democracy, scientic fact or public safety.Platforms and products must be designed with privacy, ersity and security in mind. This year we’ve seen a number of tech employees stand up and demand better business practices. We need to encourage that spirit.And most important of all, citizens must hold companies and governments accountable for the commitments they make, and demand that both respect the web as a global community with citizens at its heart.If we don’t elect politicians who defend a free and open web,we don’t do our part to foster constructive, healthy conversations online,we continue to click consent without demanding our data rights be respected, we walk away from our responsibility to put these issues on the priority agenda of our governments.The fight for the web is one of the most important causes of our time. Today, half of the world is online. It is more urgent than ever to ensure the other half are not left behind offline, and that everyone contributes to a web that drives equality, opportunity and creativity.The Contract for the Web must not be a list of quick fixes but a process that signals a sht in how we understand our relationship with our online community.It must be clear enough to act as a guiding star for the way forward but flexible enough to adapt to the rapid pace of change in technology.It’s our journey from digital adolescence to a more mature, responsible and inclusive future.The web is for everyone and collectively we hold the power to change it. It won’t be easy. Butwe dream a little and work a lot, we can get the web we want. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The country needs a new head of government before we all plunge our heads in the nearest khazi.It was bad luck that Mrs May should succumb to late winter lurgy and lose her voice this critical week at Westminster, just when she needed it most. But in politics, and le, luck sticks to winners like burrs to a sheep’s fleece.With Mrs May we have become depressingly used to things going wrong. She called a general election and somehow mislaid her majority.She made a speech at a Tory conference and the back-wall lettering started to fall off, like something from TV’s Reggie Perrin.She travelled to Germany and the door of her limo became stuck.Let’s face it: She’s a bit of a Frank Spencer, but without the laughter.Ill-fortune alone is not the reason she should go. It is her serious and serial failures as a politician, as a leader, as a communicator and parliamen-tarian that qualy her for the chop.Back in , when Gordon Brown was crowbarred out of Downing Street, some of us reckoned we would never see a worse Prime Minister.Alas, Mrs May has made calamity Brown look like Alexander the Great.She’s even less suited to the premiership than poor old Huddersfield Town.To be Home Secretary demanded mastery of small print and remorseless hard work.She lasted six years in the job and was held to have been a success .To be Prime Minister is a dferent matter. It requires vision, a sense of political philosophy, an ability — at the risk of getting flowery — to think in poetry, not prose.A good Prime Minister is like a powerful preacher, selling beliefs and soothing the people’s fears. Mrs May, as PM, has only ever stoked fear. She has made us all feel miserable.It did not help that she never believed in the  referendum’s Leave vote. She herself practically vanished in the referendum campaign, saying she supported Remain but doing almost nothing for her side. That’s cowardly.Then, when it suited her purposes, she said “Brexit means Brexit”. Her volte-face did not convince the European Commission, which clocked her as a bluffer. When she said “No Deal is better than a bad deal”, Brussels knew she would fold.A proper political leader delegates. Mrs May, however, has a mania for secrecy and it was this that led to the damaging resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson after she ambushed them with her Chequers plan last summer.She had failed to keep them informed of her plans for Brexit.The loss of those two men meant she no longer had the support of numerous pro-Brexit Tory backbenchers.Then there is her personal manner. This is going to sound ungallant but at Westminster the personal is political.She lacks an easy touch with her Parliamentary colleagues.She is an awkward mixer. Even when her voice is working, it lacks honey.One can over-state the importance of front-of-house charm — David Cameron had it in buckets and he still came a cropper — but you do need social cop-on to be an effective leader, particularly of a minority Government.I am not saying Mrs May is a bad person. She is a churchgoing soul without personal greed.She is financially honest — unlike at least one of her recent predecessors — and remarkably resilient, not least in the way she has coped with her diabetes.But you do wonder why someone so hesitant in speech and character ever went into politics. Should she not have become a judge or civil servant instead Her record of appointments has been fy. She made that sly dullard Philip Hammond her Chancellor. Have we ever had two people so unscintillating as PM and Chancellor She kept filling her Cabinet with Europhiles, even though they had little hunger for a proper Brexit.She also reappointed Amber Rudd to her top team as Pensions Secretary just a few months after former Home Secretary Rudd had left amid the Windrush scandal.How did lelong Euro-obsessive Rudd repay the favour  By plotting against May and colluding with Tory Remainers to try to block Brexit.A proper leader would not have tolerated smirking snoots like Dominic Grieve and Sir Oliver Letwin, two Tory backbenchers who have conspired against Brexit in direct contravention of their  election promises.A proper leader would have ripped into them, laying bare their elitist disregard for the millions of working-class voters who demanded that we leave the anti-democratic EU.May just simpered and dithered.She will probably have to stay for a few weeksuntil we finally leave the wretched EU, but after that the Tories must find a new leaderthey are to have any hope of winning the General Election that looks imminent.Tory activists love Boris but it is hard to see envious MPs putting him through to the final two on the ballot. Jeremy Hunt would be another May. Sajid Javid comes across as metallic and bald in more than one sense.The likeliest bet may be Andrea Leadsom, the pro-Brexit Leader of the Commons, though she needs to work on her profile.But really it could be anyone. Because anyone would be better than loser May.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I always reckoned they — our betters — would never let it happen. Yes, it’s a betrayal of democracy and we should be angry. We should march and stuff.But it won’t do much good. Because this is what happens when you have a House of Commons, House of Lords, Civil Service and broadcast media all massively in favour of Remain, against the wishes of the majority of the people.There are ten parties in the House of Commons,you count Sinn Fein . Nine are by a majority in favour of Remain.Recently, a new group of so-called Independents formed, drawn from the Labour and Conservative parties. They are even MORE in favour of Remain. So a proper Brexit was never going to get through.But it’s not just Brexit. On loads of other issues, the party ides in the House of Commons do not remotely match the ide which exists in our country. That’s because all of the parties in Parliament are basically liberal, except for the tiny DUP.So, take immigration. All of them are in favour of the vast numbers entering the country each year. While more than  per cent of the British people want an end to untrammelled immigration.It’s a Conservative government which is insisting that junior school kids be taught about transgenderism, same-sex partnerships and so on. None of the major parties will stick up for the traditional family — which often offers the best outcomes for children.But all of the major parties will stick up for Islam, despite the sincere reservations many of the rest of us harbour. They are scared of taking tough action against jihadis whohere from Syria. Most of us would like them booted out of the country, right now.And they act like this because they are liberals — a dying political creed which is on the run across Europe and the USA and South America. And which has never been very popular in Asia.I think we need to spend more money on stuff like the NHS, housing and regional development. I think there’s a corrosive ide in the UK between North and South and between the haves and have- nots. I like the idea of our railways being in state hands. That should make me a Labour supporter.But I cannot abide that anti-Semitic rabble, their loathing of the UK and the nation state — and their support for every form of victimhood which raises its screeching head. Or their support for anti-Western, racist terrorists and failed communist states. Nor, indeed, their generosity in handing out taxpayers’ money to the perpetually idle. My rule is,you don’t give, you don’t get.My guess is a lot of people feel the same way. But in the House of Commons there is no party to vote for which squares that circle. Outside Parliament there is — the Social Democratic Party, which is growing rapidly and ticks all those boxes I mentioned above. I joined them recently.But otherwise we have a House of Commons which, on a whole bunch of crucial issues, does not reflect the opinion of the majority of the country.If this Brexit catastrophe tells us anything, it’s that our politics MUST change. The people must be given a voice.And nine million people in the world die every year as a consequence of global air pollution.These are pretty shocking statistics.But two thoughts occur.First, almost everything we’ve done to reduce air pollution hasn’t worked. For example, we tried to force everyone to drive diesel cars.Then discovered they were even worse than petrol engines.Second, isn’t it simply because there are more and more of us on this crowded island and on this crowded planet HERO of the week is Countdown star Rachel Riley.

Evil goblins have apparently been terrorising a village in Zimbabwe.Residents of Ziqaweni awake each morning to find their children have been eaten, their crops destroyed and their livestock slaughtered.They can be complete b******s, these goblins, apparently.One villager, who wished to remain anonymous in case the goblins got him, said: “Right now we don’t know how we will be helped because we believe these goblins can be killed but later on come back in full force.”Well, indeed, it’s a tricky one.The villagers are clubbing together to hire a “tsikamutanda” – a witch doctor – to cleanse the area.A few months ago in Zimbabwe, goblins – possibly the same goblins – reportedly “took over” a maternity clinic in Lupaka and had sex with everybody in it, as they do.This column is often accused of failing to cover news concerning both Africa and, indeed, goblins.

You were at the heart of the core activities that had to be carried out.You were not just there to fetch and carry.In my judgement this must rank among the worst offences of its type.Prosecutor Arabella MacDonald said the heist was of the utmost sophistication and years in the planning, adding that without Mr Seeds knowledge and expertise the conspirators could not have entered the Hatton Garden Safety Deposit.Speaking outside court, Detective Chief Inspector Mark Bedford, the senior investigating officer in the case, told reporters: These men were career criminals who carried out one of the biggest safety deposit centre heists in British criminal history without a moments thought for any of the victims.For many of the victims these safety deposit boxes contained their le savings and these were cruelly snatched from them by Michael Seed and the previously convicted co-defendants in this matter.It can now be revealed how the well-spoken Cambridge biophysicist’s son finally unmasked as ‘Basil’ today, was accused in court last month of having the outstanding loot from the £ million Hatton Garden heist.Barrister Nathaniel Rudolf, representing -year-old blagger John ‘Kenny’ Collins at an assets recovery hearing, said: “In a number of documents unchallenged before the crown court, the holder of the money was ‘Basil.’“It may not be a physical stretch that Basil himself has the money. It is a reasonable suggestion that it will be him who will have to pay the full money.”Mr Rudolf drew short of naming Seed as Basil at the Westminster magistrates court hearing.But jurors at South London’s Woolwich crown court convicted Seed of being the mystery Hatton Garden bandit dubbed ‘Basil’ by other gang members.Well-spoken Seed, who grew up in Cambridge, where his distinguished father took a PhD at Christ Church, was a fish out of water among the team of cockney veteran villains, dubbed the ‘Diamond Wheezers.’Underworld sources say Seed believes he was “ grassed up” as ‘Basil’ by an accomplice desperate to get back £. million of loot to hand over to cops and avoid a further seven years in jail.Seed also told jurors how he was beaten up in the street close to his council flat in Islington, North London, in February last year, leaving him with such severe injuries he could not leave his home afterwards.Around seven weeks after the heist, on June , the UK Border Agency recorded Seed leaving the country from Heathrow airport on a budget flight to Lisbon, Portugal. He ed on July .By the end of November , Seed had been identied by police and was back under surveillance near his one-bedroom council flat in Islington, north London.Officers tracked Seed again on CCTV cameras as he wandered around Canary Wharf on  April .But he was still free to travel to Lisbon for another holiday in July the same year.He took a third trip - this time flying to Santiago de Compostela, in north-west Spain - in June , but was arrested before he could jet off for another planned break in July last year.“I looked so bad, I did not want to leave the flat,” he said.Reportedly, the attack - never reported to police - came soon after Hatton Garden gang ringleaders Brian ‘The Master’ Reader, , Collins and Terry Perkins, , were ordered to pay back £.million at a confiscation hearing on January  last year.They face another seven years jail in addition to similar sentences imposed for the burglary unless they stump up the money.Police believe at least £ million stolen in the Easter  safe deposit centre raid is still outstanding.Within a week of the confiscation order, Perkins died in Belmarsh prison from a heart attack while Reader and Collins were subsequently freed from jail after serving their tarfs for the Easter  burglary.Reader, Collins and other gang members are due to appear back in court for another confiscation hearing in June when they will receive their default sentences unless the missing money is found.Seed was arrested by Flying Squad cops on March  last year and in his cluttered flat, cops found £, worth of gold and jewellery stolen from the Hatton Garden raid in a wardrobe.Seed told the jury it had been given to him a by a friend of Collins to look after.He said he was planning to melt down the gold after hearing Collins was about to be released from jail, but was arrested before he could do so.Following his arrest, Seed’s lawyers successfully pleaded for him to be remanded to Wandsworth jail, away from Hatton garden accomplices serving their sentences at Belmarsh.The following month he refused to appear at Woolwich crown court - adjoining Belmarsh - for a legal hearing, opting to stay in his cell at Wandsworth.An underworld source held at Wandsworth at the same time, said: “Seed was paranoid the other Hatton Garden blaggers were going to do him at Belmarsh.“He was convinced that one of the Hatton Garden firm had grassed him up after earlier having him bashed up to put the pressure on him handing over the gold and tom .“When that didn’t work he thinks he was bubbled up.”Seed’s trial heard how he played a vital role in the Hatton Garden heist, cutting the alarms after entering the front door of the building with a key before letting accomplices in through a side fire exit door.He squeezed through a cm by cm hole cut by a diamond-tipped drill into the vault where he and Danny Jones, emptied  boxes.Seed was alleged to be the mysterious figure dubbed ‘Basil the Ghost’ during the trial of his ageing “diamond wheezer” cohorts.CCTV showed him wearing a blue boiler suit, high-vis jacket, ear defenders and a hat and red wig, with a black bin bag on his shoulder cleverly concealing his face.He was referred to as ‘Basil’ by his accomplices Perkins, Jones and Collins during conversations in their cars covertly recorded by Sweeney detectives after the burglary.They paid tribute to Basil’s skills at breaching alarm systems but described him as living in the “cheapest gaffs .”Police photographed Seed with Collins in a Shoreditch park three weeks after the raid - but did not know who he was at the time.He was then covertly filmed by cops in Canary Wharf in April  and a gait expert identied him as Basil because he had the same funny Charlie Chaplin-style walk.But it was not until almost two years later - and eight weeks after seven-year confiscation default sentences were given to the Hatton Garden leaders - that Seed was finally arrested.As well as the gold and jewellery, devices for nobbling alarms and mobile phones were found along with manuals of safes used by high security firms.There were drills and a BT workman’s jacket which the Crown alleged he used to case targets and which Seed claimed had been left in his flat by a drinking companion.Nottingham University physics and electronics graduate Seed had previously been jailed for three years for supplying LSD and cannabis to friend in ,  years before the National DNA Database was set up.But his expertise in electronics, honed to defeat sophisticated security systems, brought him together with some of the most notorious figures in the London underworld.The son of a university professor, Seed, , grew up in Cambridge, where he made frequent visits to his mother in her s, until Flying Squad detectives came through his door in an early morning raid on March  last year.Officers - who made simultaneous searches of Seeds mothers large house in Cambridge and his brothers ground-floor flat in Forest Gate, east London, found £, worth of jewellery, gold ingots and gems stolen in the Hatton Garden raid.Seed was not known to police three years earlier when he was photographed twice meeting another member of the gang in the weeks after the £ million burglary.As a teenager, he took A-levels in physics, chemistry, maths and geology at a secondary modern school outside Cambridge before working in an electronics factory making parts for submarine detectors.I have always had an interest in electronics, well-spoken Seed told jurors during his trial at Woolwich Crown Court. It was a passion of mine.Seed studied physics and electronics at Nottingham University, where he enjoyed recreational drugs and used to take LSD every weekend before his one previous run-in with the law.In , aged , Seed was handed a three-year prison sentence for supplying controlled drugs of Class A and Class B after selling  LSD tablets and some cannabis to a friend.He was released after serving  months and got his one-bedroom council flat in Islington for £ a week, where he lived up until his arrest, when his rent had risen to £.Seed told jurors he worked fixing televisions, video recorders and computers before moving into the jewellery trade in the mid-s.After his release from jail, Seed made a living on the black economy selling and recyling jewellery and tinkering with electronic gadgets, neither paying tax or claiming benefits - like a posh Del Boy.He said he met Reader, Jones and Collins while working in Hatton Garden and the latter owed him £ for a diamond he had sold him around the time of the safe deposit centre break-in.Seed was linked to the Chatila jewellery raid through his DNA being taken after his arrest for Hatton Garden.But he was cleared of the burglary by a jury of six men and six women who took  hours and  minutes to deliver their verdicts.Seed showed no emotion as he was convicted of the Hatton Garden burglary and conspiracy to conceal criminal property.In the Chatila raid, blaggers stole £ million worth of gems from display cabinets but missed out on a £ million fortune in the safe because their drill was an inch too short to penetrate it.According to bugged chats among the robbers, it was one of THREE heists, including Hatton Garden, allegedly planned by Reader.Jones, , of Enfield, North London, was jailed for three years for the Chatila raid in July last year after pleading guilty because his DNA was on the glove. He is due for release in .Perkins died before he could be re-tried over the burglary after the first trial was halted last year for legal reasons.Scrap metal dealer Charles “Chick’ Matthews, , was sentenced to four-and-half years last month after being convicted of handling stolen jewellry from the Chatila raid at Southwark crown court.His left thumb print was on a small plastic bag containing a large emerald found above a removable office ceiling tile when Hatton Garden cops aided his London City Metals firm in Silvertown, East London."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000476252046.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"michael thigpen emma grace thigpen uber kentucky","story":"Emma Grace died after her and her two siblings were left in a van parked outside Michael Thigpen’s trailer in Logan County, Kentucky.The -year-old had been awake for  hours when he finished his sht for Uber in his van, the court heard.He then took his we to work before coming back home and falling asleep in bed, leaving his three daughters in the van.Thigpen work up several hours later to series of “frantic texts” from his we, Logan County Detective Charles Dauley said.Authorities arrived T the trailer park and found three children unresponsive in the trailer.An -month-old and -year-old were treated at a hospital for heat-related medical issues – but little Emma died on June , , Dauley said.Other reports suggested the tragedy happened in .Thigpen originally told police his -month-old, -month-old and -year-old had been sleeping in a room in the trailer when the air conditioner lost power.During a second interview with police, Thigpen admitted he left his daughters in the van.Dauley said: “He brought the children into the trailer, gave them Pedialyte through a syringe and put cold rags on them.”Thigpen pleaded guilty to a count of second-degree manslaughter and two counts of first-degree assault.Judge Tyler Gill sentenced him for  years behind bars.During sentencing Gill said: The nature of this offense call out for this sentence,.We’ve got to protect our children, you can’t live by accident. shouldn’t have been left with these kids after being up for  hours.This was just a tragedy waiting to happen."},{"url":null,"title":"sajid javid urged to fast track crackdown on online harm which could be two years away","story":"The Home Secretary and Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright are preparing to slap social media giants with a statutory Duty of Care to protect Brits from “online harms”.The policy is due to be unveiled in the final week of March.But insiders told The Sun yesterday that a new independent regulatory body proposed to police the crackdown may not be up and running until  given the time required to pass necessary legislation.Separately, officials have warned the “scope” of the crackdown is so wide that websites such as Netmums and TripAdvisor may be dragged into it.One insider said: “As it’s been proposed, the regulatory framework will apply to any company that allows people to share content or interact with each other.“So that’s social media s but also public discussion forums.”The Home Office wants the new regulator to concentrate on companies that “pose the biggest risk”.

I got my two best friends to record me reading a scene from the movie and we stupidly decided to do it after a bottle of wine for Dutch courage.When I sent my audition tapes through I sounded more Irish than American and I missed out on a potentially huge role.I just wish I had put my mind to it more, but I didn’t really have an interest in acting back then.Kelly Rohrbach got the lead and looked amazing in it. The film wasn’t actually that great . . . but it would have been pretty cool to work alongside Zac Efron and The Rock.SET the controls for the best day of my childhood – Saturday July , , a glorious day of sunshine and showers when England won the FIFA World Cup Final against West Germany.Every second of it is etched in my mind – Nobby dancing, Bobby Moore’s golden aura and Kenneth Wolstenholme’s commentary.“There are people on the pitch – they think it’s all over – it is now!”It was a day to make you believe in magic.I watched it, aged , with my mum – my dad worked every weekend – and I squeaked “F***” when the Germans equalised to make it - at the end of normal time.It was the only time in my le that I ever said “F***” in front of my mum.She forgave me immediately “as it’s the Germans,” she said, the Blitz still fresh in her memory after  years – and went to put the kettle on as we settled down for extra time.It was a day of excitement, pride, patriotism, passion and pure, undiluted drama.WHEN I was a kid I wanted to be an astronautand also an RAF fighter pilot.I was lucky enough to be taken up in a Phantom jet in September , when I helped launch the annual air show at RAF Leuchars, in Fe.Awesome is an overused word, but not in this case.I was given training, poured into a G-suit and for the next hour I had the thrill ride of a letime.Obviously I did nothing but sit there enthralled while not touching any important buttons.We pulled three Gs, which was a bit like being cuddled by a gorilla, but women withstand G-Force better than men and, unlike Jeremy Clarkson, I managed not to throw up.At one point I was upside down and flying so fast I felt I had left my body behind.I wish I could go back in time to relive that moment again and again.I HAVE done a lot of really stupid things – often on purpose. When I told my mum I was leaving college to join a band she told me not to be stupid. But that actually worked out OK.For sure I’ve taken plenty of bad advice over the years and committed countless, colossal clangers.If I could go back in time I absolutely would but not to sort out any of my messes.I’d like to make something that was totally brilliant even more mind-blowingly brilliant than it was to start with.It would be to the summer of .

Far too many cars on the road. But I can remember exactly how it felt, clear as anything. Woo-hoo.I WOULD go back to the autumn of , when I was living in New York.My flatmate was in real estate and he had got wind of an apartment building, jointly owned by the residents, that had gone bankrupt.He said you could now buy two-bedroom apartments in this building for as little as ,.

I under­stand these talks were broadly positive. One Cabinet minister close to the process tells me the chances of the DUP backing the deal are, “a bit better than :. I’d put it at :”.What is winning round the DUP is the promise of putting into the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which puts the deal into UK law, a requirement that there be no ergence between Northern Ireland and Britain.The Withdrawal Agreement Bill would be so-called superior legislation. This would mean it would trump any other bill, giving the DUP some reassurance that the next Prime Minister couldn’t let regulatory dferences emerge between the rest of the UK and Northern Ireland.Parliament will also be given a scrutiny power over the backstop, allowing it to vote every few years on how it is operating.At the same time, the UK Government will seek to offer the DUP some reassurance about this country’s ability to get out of the backstop. I am told thatAttorney General Geoffrey Cox’s legal advice had been dferent, then the DUP would have been on board this week. One Cabinet minister tells me:“Geoffrey did cost the DUP.”To sweeten the deal for the DUP, there will be money and ladles of respect. The DUP want a new “policy package” to replace their confidence and supply deal with the Tories which runs out in June.To say that these negotiations are delicate would be an understatement. I am told, “ people put too much pressure on them, there’s a danger that they’ll bolt”.But with this Speaker and this Parliament any hopes for a better one, or for a clean break, seem for the birds.As James Forsyth says, the “big beasts” of the backbenches must show some leadership.Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and Iain Duncan Smith were leading lights of the Leave campaign, but by not backing the deal they are now imperilling the whole project. They won’t be forgiven.Good card players know when to hold ’em and know when to fold ’em.Wise politicians must be no dferent.Butthe Government can get the DUP, it is confident that Jacob Rees-Mogg will then come on board.Despite voting against the deal on Tuesday, European Research Group chairman Rees-Mogg left himself a ladder to climb down, repeat­edly declaring that the only reason to vote for this deal wasBrexit was in genuine danger.After the Commons voted against No Deal and for an extension, it clearly is.The big question is how many Brexiteer rebels climb down Jacob’s ladder. Downing Street think there are  to  Tory diehards who won’t vote for the deal even with the DUP on board.The precise number is absolutely crucial. As one senior Downing Street source explains: “If it is at the lower end of that scale, it can be made up with Labour. If it is at the higher end, it can’t be.”There are, I’m told, between  and  Labour MPs prepared to back a deal but onlyit has a realistic chance of passing. Influential figures in the Cabinet are urging No to make the vote on Tuesday a free vote, to make it easier for Labour MPs to support it.If the deal doesn’t pass on Tuesday, then Mrs May will have to go to the European Council on Thursday and beg for a full-on extension to the Article  process. I am told she is dreading this personal and national humiliation.The Commons should spare her and, more importantly, the country, that.RIGHT now there is little sign that either Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab are going to move and back the Brexit deal.Both feel that their reservations about it are still too strong.But there is a danger for them both –  Tory Eurosceptics voted against the deal on Tuesday night.Whatever happens with the DUP, that number will drop a bit when the meaningful vote comes back for a third time.The danger for Boris and Raab is thatthey walk through the lobbies with this shrinking group, they will start to be seen as purely factional candidates, and purely factional candidates rarely win leadership contests.Already some of those who backed Boris last time and had been planning to do so again are peeling away.Now is a moment that calls for bigness.If either Boris or Raab were prepared to say that – despite their reservations – they were going to try to get the deal over the line, because Brexit is only going to get softer otherwise, they would show they have the selflessness necessary to lead.WHEN your voice is going, what’s the last thing that you want  A meeting with a heavy smoker.But that is what Theresa May had to contend with on Monday after she flew to Strasbourg for last-minute talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.By Wednesday, Mrs May’s voice was so bad that No had a plan for Andrea Leadsom,  to take over halfway through PMQsher voice gave out completely.TO get people to do things you need both a carrot and a stick.But the problem for the Government is that its warnings to Brexiteer rebels are all stick.It is pointing out that Brexit will only get softerMPs don’t vote for the deal. This is right, but these MPs need a positive inducement too.One Tory who carries messages from Theresa May’s Downing Street to the Brexiteer rebels tells me: “If she offered to go, she would get very close and possibly do it.“It unlocks those people whose self-perception is that they don’t give in to blackmail.” This source continues: “If the DUP move, Jacobmoves,Jacob moves others follow, but you don’t quite get there without the carrot.”Mrs May could leave with dignity, having secured an orderly Brexit and having managed to avoid a split in the Tory party.She wouldn’t need to leave the next day, either.But just in time to ensure that a new Prime Minister had their feet firmly under the desk before a new European Commission comes into office this autumn.One reason why an indication that May will go is so important is that there is assumption she will try to staythe withdrawal agreement passes.One Cabinet minister tells me: “If she gets a deal through, she won’t be able to resist clinging on.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Attorney General Geoffrey Cox torpedoed Mrs May’s plan last week when he judged Britain would be unable to exit the Backstop without permission.

But Star Chamber experts believe the bid is “badly misconceived”.

And it wasnt even against the rules. Closing his speech to the House of Commons, Barclay: It is time for this house to act in the national interest. It’s time to put forward an extension that is realistic. I commend the motion put forward by the government to the house.   MPs voted - for the motion, which the PM was forced to lay after MPs rejected both her deal and No Deal this week. But she granted her MPs a free vote. Asked about Mr Barclays decision to urge MPs to vote for a motion second before he voted against it, the PMs spokesman said: “It was a free vote that the PM authorised.” So even though Mr Barclay was contradicting his own speech with his actions, he didnt break any rules and wont face disciplinary action. The motion makes the UK ask the EU for a delay no matter what, but thedepends on whether MPs back the Brexit deal in a third vote next week.   If Mrs May can persuade Tory Brexiteers and the DUP to finally back her, by threatening a huge delay and offering legal tweaks, then she will ask the EU for a delay until June . If she cannot agree a deal by next Wednesday, she will go to meet  EU leaders at a summit and Thursday and ask for a longer extension. Theresa Mays deputy David Lidington told BBC Radio s Today programme: It was a free vote in that ision yesterday. Now, what happens this morning is that the entire Cabinet has accepted the position that Parliament voted for last night. Ive been working very constructively with SteveBarclaysince his appointment a couple of months ago despite the fact that he and I were vigorously on opposite sides of the debate during the referendum, and we are continuing to work very constructively together today and in the days to come.  Mr Lidington said he believed that Leave-backing ministers had used the free vote as an opportunity to register how unhappy they were with being in the position where we dont really have an option as a country except to seek an extension of our time in the European Union. Mr Lidington said that leaving on March  with no deal remains the legal default position but the likelihood of it happening had diminished after this weeks votes. He said he was still hoping that the UK will leave as soon as possible in an orderly fashion by MPs backing Mrs Mays Withdrawal Agreement next week. Askeddefeat for the PMs deal might mean an extension of a year or more, Mr Lidington said: Those are the indications which the Brussels institutions of the EU - the Commission, the Council secretariat and certain member state governments - have been giving to us. He added: I hope that MPs of all parties will be over this weekend just reflecting on the way forward.

Bradley appeared as a mascot for his beloved Sunderland AFC and struck up a bond with their then striker Jermain Defoe. But the boy died aged just six on Friday July ,  .Speaking after having the tattoo done this week, Carl said: I miss Bradley every day, and wanted to do something as a tribute to him. I decided on a portrait on my chest so I always have him close to my heart.  Speaking to Sunderland Echo , he added: I am over the moon with the tattoo.The huge tattoo was designed by Lee Ganley, a tattoo artist from County Durham with more than  years experience. It took him around six hours to complete at his parlour, Buzzin Guns in Durham. The poignant writing on the inking reads: Your wings were ready, My heart was not. Lee, who has shared a photo of the tattoo on Instagram , also told Sunderland Echo: Im use to doing portraits and I do quite a lot of celebrity faces but there as something special about this.Theres definitely a little bit more pressure but it was a good photo and a good client. Carl was really happy with it. He just couldnt stop smiling. The picture is more fun and it shows Bradleys cheeky face.

It was just an honour to do.Last year, Defoe got a tattoo in memory to Bradley , whom he called his best friend.  The striker, now on loan at Rangers from AFC Bournemouth, was Bradleys hero. Their precious bond began in September  when Sunderland hosted Everton in a Premier League clash at the Stadium of Light.And the former England forward was visibly emotional at the boys funeral .Following Bradleys passing, Defoe said: He was my best friend. He was genuine. He loved his football. He loved me and I loved him. There was nothing I could give him apart from just being a friend.

She was eventually refunded pound - despite the company Forever to Hold having proof of postage.Immediately after receiving the refund, co-owner Sarah Weatherill, , claims the woman blocked her and business partner Lisa Husband, , on Facebook .However a year later, Sarah was left in disbelief when she noticed the woman, from Port Glasgow, Scotland, had posted wedding pictures online with her clutching what appeared to be the exact articial flower bouquet in the snaps. After confronting her, Sarah was finally able to get the money back - but only after threatening to contact the police. She claimed that the flowers miraculously turned up at her neighbours in July - SEVEN MONTHS after they were sent.   Sarah, from Whitby, North Yorkshire, said: I was so shocked. I bet she thought shed never be found out but you cant hide anything anymore [with social media]. To us pound is a lot of money. But we refunded her because we wanted to keep our customer services reputation. We work so hard on our business - theres only me and Lisa and we very rarely get a wage from it. Theres so much out there in the news about businesses scamming brides, but Ive never heard of a bride who scams a business. We love what we do. Thats whats upset us more than anything. We cant believe what has happened. I didnt think anyone could ever do that. In January , Sarah and Lisa sent out the wedding bouquet as signed for delivery - around eight months before she tied the knot.   But after claiming she had never received the delivery, the bride started a five-month conversation about the missing flowers, with Sarah continuously contacting Royal Mail for updates. As soon as Sarah sent the refund cheque, she claims she vanished and was never heard from again. Sarah said: When were making bouquets we send photos to make sure everything is okay. We sent her flowers and she said she never received them. We were going to the Post Office and everything. In the end she said she wanted her money back. I came to the agreement with her because we wanted the business to do well so we sent her a full refund. All of a sudden she disappeared and shed blocked me. I said to Lisa go on your Facebook and seeyou can contact her and she couldnt, shed blocked her. Shed also blocked me husband. I thought something didnt add up, but I let it go because we were so busy. Last weekend [March ], Sarah was searching through old messages when she spotted Jordannes name and remembered the incident. Sarah said: I clicked on her profile and it wouldnt work, but her profile picture was her on her wedding day with her flowers [next to new hubby Sean].   I wasnt  per cent sure they were ours and needed more clarication. On the photos was the photo credit and I did a bit of investigation and messaged the photographer. I asked for more photos of the flowers for the wedding and the photographer sent some pictures over - they were  per cent our flowers. Ive looked back and theyve got exactly the same hessian wrapping on, exactly the same flowers, exactly the same style, exactly where we placed them. They are our flowers, because we keep photos of all the bouquets we send. I thought it was bizarre when she blocked us as soon as she got her money. After Sarah contacted f with her findings, she says the customer claimed she hadnt scammed them and the payment had simply gone over [her] head. Sarah refused Jordannes offer to repay the balance by pound per week and eventually she paid the pound back in full - after being told the incident would be reported to the police. Sarah said: I requested the payment in full or said I would take it further.   At first, she said she didnt have the funds and could pay pound a week. We said no and mentioned that we contact the police. Then she paid us back in full two days later. Sarah started making articial flower bouquets after making her own for her wedding and being inundated with requests from friends. But in , after having a heart attack, she was forced to quit her full-time job as a nanny and officially launched Forever to Hold with mother-in-law and business partner Lisa. Sarah said: When I started off I was just a normal business but weve built it up from scratch so quickly. It was crazy. I was working seven days a week and trying to do flowers. Then in August  I had a heart attack. I ended up in a hospital for over a week and I realised something had to give. I decided to go for it and thats when Lisa came on board. Since she came on board its gone crazy. The woman was contacted for comment but failed to respond. She appears to have since removed or deactivated her Facebook account.

Aimee Sanderson, , alleged her boss Steve Brennan - founder of digital agency Bespoke based in Bamber Bridge, Lancashire - sarcastically said Well thats good news isnt it when she told him of her pregnancy. The mother-of-ones claims of unfair dismissal and unfavourable treatment were well founded, an employment tribunal found. The hearing found in favour of Mrs Sandersons allegations and that her pregnancy or intended maternity leave was a material factor in the decision to dismiss her. The report said it appeared Mr Brennan took a decision, even before disciplinary proceedings were initiated, that the claimant was to be dismissed and concerns were exaggerated in such a way as to attempt to justy a finding of gross misconduct. Mrs Sanderson was thrilled when found out she was pregnant in July  - just months after she had suffered a miscarriage earlier in the year.   However, when she told her boss she was shocked at his reaction. Mrs Sanderson, who lives with her husband Dean, , and their son Charlie in Garstang, said she was hauled into meetings about her performance before she was eventually dismissed for gross misconduct in December . She said: “Some of the things the CEO said to me throughout those months were dismissive. I had thought I’d had quite a good relationship with him before. “I became convinced it was because I was pregnant.” Furious at her treatment, she took her case to an employment tribunal, which found in her favour. Mrs Sanderson also claimed that after his response to her good news that she was pregnant, Mr Brennan also told her: “There’s just too many people in that team and not enough work, you know what that means don’t you. She said that his words came across to her like a “veiled threat”. She added: “His reaction was incredible. It knocked me off my feet.   “It was common knowledge in the office that I had had a miscarriage.” Staff at the firm had been critical when she had called in to work with sickness relating to pregnancy and were digging for information from her colleagues to askshe was under performing, Mrs Sanderson said. Judge Slater said during the tribunal - which took place in Manchester on December  to ,  and February ,  - that “direct evidence of discrimination is rare. He added: We must consider what inferences we can properly draw from all the relevant surrounding circumstances.” Ahead of a disciplinary hearing Mr Brennan set out his allegations in a letter to Mrs Sanderson. The grievances listed included that she was not delivering on work promised to clients, which adversely affected the business relationship with the clients. According to the findings from the tribunal, the letter stated the companys viewed the allegations constituted gross misconduct. In the concluding comments of the document which records the employment tribunal, the report concluded that her pregnancy or intended maternity leave was a material factor in the decision to dismiss her. The report said: “It appears to us that Mr Brennan took a decision, even before disciplinary proceedings were initiated, that the claimant was to be dismissed and concerns were exaggerated in such a way as to attempt to justy a finding of gross misconduct.”   Mrs Sanderson’s little child is now one year old, and after receiving the tribunal results she is now looking for a new job. She said: “If I hadn’t taken the company all the way that I took them, what happens when the next person gets pregnant  “The whole experience put a lot of stress on my marriage, my parents. “Butyou do something that you know in your heart is right then I think you are stronger from it.” A hearing where judges will decide how much Bespoke Digital Agency must award Mrs Sanderson, takes place on Thursday, April . Lauren Grice, head of partnerships at Bespoke said in a statement that the company would be appealing the tribunal judgement.

The teenager told the Mirror that at first she was worried about using the new product but after a few weeks decided to give it a go before a night out.   But Chloe was left humiliated and in pain after she claims the device failed to release her hair - and pulled out a huge clump on the back of her head. The mortied teenager was left with a pile of her long hair on her bed, and burst into tears. The undergraduate from Bradford, West Yorkshire, said: I was screaming. It was really painful. I was so embarrassed I didnt want to show anybody. I just stayed at home and cried. I was quite concerned about it burning my scalp because it was quite hot.

It was coming up with an ER error message. It saidthe error came up, it meant you had too much hair in there, so I started using smaller portions.  I put my hair into the curler and pressed the button. It got caught again, so I pressed the error button but it didnt let it go but pulled it in tighter. It was pulling more hair in from other areas. Every time I tried to release the hair or reset the error, the curler would suck up more and more hair leaving the curler pressed directly against my scalp. After cancelling her night out, she took some painkillers and went to bed. Chloe contacted Remington to complain about the product, which her grandmother bought from Debenhams for pound - reduced from pound.

I’m proud to have been a part of that.” Jess Harris, , pancreas and kidney  A year ago Jess was sitting in her studio apartment hooked up to a dialysis machine, desperately waiting for a kidney and pancreas transplant.

She spends four hours every other day on a hospital dialysis machine. The rest of the time she is in such pain she can barely move. Son Romaine, , is her full-time carer. Nadine, who moved from Jamaica to Croydon, South London,  years ago says: “Sadly, I am still on the transplant list but I cannot thank Daily Mirror readers enough for everything they have done to help raise awareness of people in my situation, in agonising pain and with no quality of le. “This must change and Max’s Law finally feels like aleline.” Vicky Horan, , three kidneys  Sporty Vicky was part of the “luckiest team alive”, the British Volleyball Transplant line-up who supported our campaign as they competed at the British Transplant Games in .

Seventeen lives were saved with his organs. His sister Christine, right, says: “I was delighted to hear the news that Max and Keira’s Law has finally gone through Parliament and is set to become law. “How wonderful that  years after my campaign began we got there, which is fitting since it will be  years since my brother died. “The Daily Mirror readers have made a huge contribution to this campaign. “Thank you all so much. We really appreciate the part you have played.” Ricky Moate, , bowel  Time was running out for Ricky who was born with his bowel outside of his body. For years he had waited for a transplant and had  major operations and hundreds of minor surgeries. Last June a donor was found, just as doctors discovered his bowel had begun to die. Ricky, , from Sheffield, says: “Knowing how close I was to dying has made this transplant more meaningful. “It shows why it’s so important that we have enough donor organs. I’m up and down but I’m OK. “I am a million times better than I was. I wouldn’t be here without it. “The fact that we’ve help to change the law is only a good thing – nothing bad can come of this.” Sonia Carey, , kidney  My transplant has “given me my children back,” says Sonia Carey from Bournemouth. The mum-of-three was diagnosed with kidney disease at  and for three years was hooked up to a dialysis machine four times a day. Although she was able to do this at home, it meant she was a prisoner there because her routine didn’t allow for a normal le. Last February she finally got the kidney transplant she so desperately needed from a stranger on the organ donation register. Sonia says: “Thanks to my donor I can now give all my time to my children. “ I can just be normal and have my le back. I am so grateful. “What the Mirror did is really important.

Shockingly  per cent said they have to provide clothes for disadvantaged pupils and  per cent said they even have to wash their pupils’ garments. Mrs Bone said: “We have far too many children with no heating in the home, no food in the cupboards, washing themselves with cold water, walking to school with holes in their shoes and trousers that are ill-fitted and completely worn out, and living on one hot meal a day provided at school.” The findings come against a background of intense pressure on school budgets with all but three of the  headteachers admitting to having to making cuts since . Geoff Barton, general secretary of the ASCL, said: “A decade of austerity has wreaked havoc with the social fabric of the nation and schools have been left to pick up the pieces while coping with real-term funding cuts.   “They have become an unofficial fourth emergency service for poor and vulnerable children, providing food and clothing and filling in the gaps left by cut backs to local services.Politicians must end their fixation with Brexit and work together to build a new sense of social mission in our country. We simply must do better for struggling families and invest properly in our schools, colleges and other vital public services.A Government spokesman said: “This Government is spending pound billion a year on welfare to support those who need it most, we’ve introduced the National Living Wage and helped workers keep more of the money they earn by cutting taxes for  million people by an average of pound,. Teachers shouldn’t have to step in to tackle the issues highlighted by this survey, and we’re already taking action to make sure that they don’t have to.” "},{"url":null,"title":"top 50 things brits believe","story":"NewsTop  things that Brits believe make their perfect dayA poll revealed the days that adults thought were utterly perfect that they wish could be relived again and againShareCommentsByRichard Jenkins:,  MAR NewsMost of Brits’ ideas of what a perfect day is are totally achievable \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Shopping for a bargain in the sales, spending time in the sun-drenched garden – and going to sleep in a freshly-made bed are all elements of the average Brit’s perfect day, according to research.A poll of , adults found one in  would love nothing more than to belt a tune out in the shower, and fteen per cent would spend some time bingeing on a box set.Three in  would kick back and watch their favourite film, and one in five would indulge in retail therapy and top up their wardrobe.Another  per cent would set aside time for a family trip out, while  per cent would hope to find some money to make the day unforgettable. The study was conducted by Lottoland on the back of their annuity lottery, CashLe, where customers can bet to win pound, every day for the rest of their le. A spokesman said: “We’ve all had days we thought were utterly perfect – ones we wish we could re-live again and again.  “Our results found, quite sweetly, that most of Brits’ ideas of what a perfect day is are totally achievable. After all, it’s not impossible to take a day off work to spend the whole day at home in your pyjamas. “Butmoney were no object, it seems Brits would be happy to go to town on making their lives easier. “It’s not unusual to wish a film like Groundhog Day could come true – especiallythe day we were repeating had lots of great things happen. “And on the other hand,we had a perfect day, there are plenty of things Brits would rather not have to do – like their daily commute to work, or even the washing up after dinner.” According to the study, a ‘perfect day’ for the majority of Brits would involve waking up at am, and not going to bed until pm – giving them  hours to pack fun into. One in  parents confessed that for their perfect day, they’d spend it with their partner – with no kids allowed.   Four in  believe listening to music is a key to having a perfect day, with some of the most popular songs for maximising enjoyment being revealed. They include Bon Jovi’s Livin’ on a Prayer, Happy by Pharrell Williams, and Whitney Houston’s classic I Wanna Dance With Somebody. But the majority of Brits selected Queen’s feel-good hit Don’t Stop Me Now as the song they’d most want to hear on their dream day. And of the movies most people would want to watch when chilling out, the top pick was Dirty Dancing, followed by Mrs. Doubtfire, Star Wars and Love Actually. A fth of respondents would spend time in the pub on their perfect day, and  per cent would love nothing more than to spend the whole day inside in their pyjamas. A further  per cent would get out into nature and go for a long walk, and just eight per cent would spend time in the gym. Come teatime, a third would chow down on a full roast dinner, and  per cent would pick up a pizza.   But only a tenth would choose a salad for the meal to cap their perfect day. And as the sun goes down, more Brits would choose to stay in with a good book then head out for a raucous night on the tiles. And of the things Brits would love not to have to do any more,they somehow had endless money, one in four would immediately hire a window cleaner. Nearly one third of those who took part in the OnePoll study said they would employ the services of a chef, and a tenth would like a stylist to pick clothes out for them every morning.

Bashir Aziz, , a sales assistant and model, from London  Bashir was born with a form of vitiligo that means his black skin pigmentation is slowly coming back. As a child his mother used to put make-up on his white patches to try to hide his condition. At school children would call him “cow” or “zebra”.

The condition gave him a wider nose and tags on the left side of his face – he describes it as being similar to that of a cleft palate but with his nose.

She says: “I’ve got thousands of lumps all over my body. “I’m very self-conscious and I’m scared of public places and the way people react.” Rowdy Burton, , from Alabama, USA  Rowdy was born with the genetic condition sacral agenesis, which meant that he had both of his legs amputated when he was a toddler so that they would not become a dead weight as he grew older. He is known for walking on his hands and using a motorised skateboard to get around. Rowdy, who has recently moved in with his girlfriend, uses his YouTube channel to discuss living with no legs. He says: “I had my legs amputated when I was three because they were going to grow funny and be in the way. I’d like to change the constant assumption that I can’t do things.” Ted Parrotman, , from Bristol  Ted has undergone ious body modications to look more like his beloved parrots, of which he owns seven.

The  day period runs from Ash Wednesday until Easter Sunday and can be a real challenge for those who decide to set aside their vices.However one man has found the first week of Lent to be a breeze, despite giving up all food. Del Hall, from Cincinnati, Ohio made the shocking decision to forgo eating altogether and instead only consume beer, having between two and five beers a day.  Hall, who works at Fty West Brewing Company and is an army veteran, says his plan was inspired by the fasting rituals of th century Baian monks. And after taking on the challenge for a few days, he claims to have lost over a stone, but stresses that this isnt a new kind of diet people should try.Speaking on his YouTube Channel, he said: Im having anywhere from two to five beers a day, Im not necessarily drinking in the morning, Im not a breakfast person, so I get up, I have some water and I have a black coffee, no sweetener, no dairy in it, just black coffee.I have my first beer sometime in the afternoon and then I might have one when Im feeling peckish.   The majority of the beers Im drinking are at home, so when I get home at night I might have say two to three beers here at the house and thats pretty much a typical day.Hall went on to explain that he likes fasting, so isnt finding Lent too big of a deal.Despite this, he admitted that the first few days were pretty rough as the cravingswere intense. On Ash Wednesday, I only had one beer, then day two and day three were pretty rough, a lot of hunger, he continued.   I didnt partake but the cravings were intense. Days four and five the hunger started to subside and day six and seven I really havent had any hunger. Hall is planning to drink a iety of ales during his fast including a chocolate maple and toasted almond stout. He claims hes feeling amazing so far and that as well as losing weight, his sense of smell also seems to have improved.

Police found his penis in a plastic bag inside their flat and it was reattached in an emergency operation last Friday.

To limit any increases, the changes will be phased over a three-year period.“Currently we don’t have plans to change the heating system at Pitairlie Road. However, tenants can contact the Dundee Energy Advice Project for advice to secure the best possible energy costs.”An SSE spokesman said: “We are in contact with Mr Stevenson and are working to investigate the potential cause of the reported increase in his energy usage.“We don’t want any of our customers worrying about their energy bills and our customer service teams are here to help in any way they can.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united striker pavol safranko in slovakia call up","story":"Dundee United striker Pavol Safranko has been called up to the Slovakia squad for their forthcoming European Championship qualiers.The -year-old, on loan at Tannadice until the end of the season from Danish side Aalborg, is in the Slovaks# pool for their matches against Hungary and Wales on March  and , respectively.That means he will miss the Terrors# Championship home clash with Alloa Athletic on March .The energetic hit man has had a good season for United, scoring  goals in  games and could win a third cap for his country."},{"url":null,"title":"if united can refocus their targets it can set them up for play offs","story":"Results at the weekend and this week confirmed to me Dundee United are heading for another year in the play-offs.Andthat’s a disappointment for Arabs, what I’d say to them is things could be a lot worse.If, as I think, the route to promotion is going to be via that post-regular season lottery, it’s better to know now than later.I say that because very often in these cases a team that narrowly misses out on automatic promotion right at the end of the league campaign, or in the final week or so, goes into the play-offs on a massive downer.That makes it hard to lt players and fans and is very often why it’s one of the lower-ranked teams, one that’s been on a good run to get to that stage, that comes through and wins them.Where United are now, it would take a big collapse by leaders Ross County for them to be caught.I don’t see that happening and, evenit did, I’m not sure the Tangerines can go on the kind of winning run needed to capitalise.They have definitely been progressing under Robbie Neilson but they’re not yet where he wants them to be.That means they will drop points at times, like last Saturday at Partick Thistle, and that will make it even harder for them to put any real pressure on County.That’s why I think knowing top spot is gone with a few weeks to spare could prove a blessing in disguise for Robbie Neilson and his players.They have to keep their eye on the ball and make sure they don’t slip out of second spot – something that cost them dearly under Csaba Laszlo last season.If they do that, though, they can use the next couple of months to make sure the squad is ready for the final promotion push.That might mean resting some players here and there, while others could be worked a bit harder in training to get their fitness levels up a bit.A few of the players brought in during the January window hadn’t been playing a lot, so giving them extra training would be useful.One worry I have for United is, in the past couple of games, they’ve looked a side teams know how to play against. Particularly against Inverness last week, they seemed to be able to keep United at arms’all too easily.I think that had a lot to do with the tempo of their play, which was not high enough.

I’d played in the friendlies and was mixing with the boys really well. We’ve got a good bunch of lads here so that’s really helped at what already is a great club.“Sometimes it’s a risk taking a gamble on somebody who’s taken a bit of time out of the game.“I’m just happy to be back playing and training and, most importantly, I’m enjoying it again.“A break is needed sometimes, maybe so you can see how much you miss playing or even the buzz in and about the dressing-room and, most importantly, how much you love it.“When you’re playing full time and when you’re playing for so long, you kind of take it for granted.“You become immersed in it and you realise how dependent you are on the game as it’s always going to be there.“It’s when you take that step back it really hits home how much you need it in your le, that what’s happened in my case.“You just need to play for as long as you can and enjoy it for as long as you can, or until, unfortunately, your body gives up on you.“I’ve always been the type of person who wants to win every game and every duel –you’re playing football and you don’t want to play and win every game then you’re most likely in the wrong profession.“I’ve still got that hunger that I’ve took everywhere with me, it’s just the type of person I am.”"},{"url":null,"title":"pavol safranko call up is crucial county clash blow for dundee united","story":"Dundee United have been dealt a blow after striker Pavol Safranko was named in the Slovakia squad for their opening European Championship qualiers.While his inclusion reflects his fine form since joining the Tangerines on loan from Danes Aalborg last August, it means he will miss two important Championship fixtures.The Tangerines face leaders Ross County at Tannadice on Tuesday night in what is a must-win gamethey are to retain even a slim chance of catching the Staggies in the race for automatic promotion.By then, though, the -year-old will be back in his homeland preparing for a qualier against Hungary that takes place a week tonight.He will also miss the Tannadice clash with Alloa on Saturday week because the Slovakians are away to Wales the following afternoon.Ironically Safranko’s call-up comes after he was dropped to the bench for last weekend’s defeat at Partick Thistle – the first time since his arrival he’s not started a game for which he’s been available.He did end up playing for most of the proceedings at Firhill after Osman Sow picked up an injury and had to be replaced with just  minutes on the clock.Safranko’s arrival couldn’t prevent United going down - to the Jags but his goals this term have had a major impact.His  goals in  appearances in tangerine to date have made him joint-top scorer alongside Nicky Clark.Safranko’s work rate during games has also seen him repeatedly praised by boss Robbie Neilson.And while United are delighted his form for them has seen him rewarded with an international recall – he already has two caps to his name – the timing could have been better.They’ll be hoping Sow recovers from a calf problem that’s dogged him since his January arrival from MK Dons in time for Saturday’s trip to Dunfermline.Even more vital will be having the Swede in the squad for next week’s two games when Safranko will be missing.The striker is not the only United man to be recognised at international level this week.Teenager Mati Zata will also be on his travels next week after being called up by Zimbabwe.He’s in their squad for the U  AFCON qualying double header against Mozambique, with the games taking place on March  and .The -year-old was recently loaned out to local juniors Tayport to give him game time.Midfielder Zata joined United after a spell at Rangers just over a year ago.He’s had first-team experience in the Irn-Bru Cup this season.Zata has dual nationality and has also represented Scotland at U  level.

We can beat them in both of those games, we know we’re capable of that but we’d need to win all the other games as well.“What’s important is that we go on a winning run because that’s a massive thing going into the end of the season, whether you’re going for automatic promotion oryou are going to be in the play-offs.”The -year-old’s experience of the second tier tells him how dficult that’s going to be and,anything, he believes putting together a winning run this term is harder than it’s ever been.“I think when you look at the league right now you see that any time you’re playing, there is no guaranteed games you are going to win.“Everyone in the league has something to play for, whether it’s the teams up at the top or the ones down at the bottom.“I think this is one of the tightest seasons I’ve seen for a few years.”That view is backed up by the progress of today’s opponents.Until a five-game winning streak, the Pars were looking over their shoulders and worrying about being dragged into a relegation dogfight.Now they’re in a play-off spot and,they can make it six wins on the trot today, they’d be challenging United in the race for second place.That makes this game almost as vital as the looming clash with Ross County at Tannadice on Tuesday.Stanton knows he and his team-mates will have their work cut out today but stressed the aim is to maintain an unbeaten East End Park record that stretches back to .“As a club we’ve had a good record against Dunfermline and we want to keep that going.“They are on a good run right now but we believe we can go there and win.“If we do win this one we keep a gap to the teams below us.“That’s important but we just have to look to be winning games as often as possible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"craigholme-school-glasgow-girls-school-to-close-over-dwindling-pupil-numbers","story":"A GLASGOW school ndash one of the last private girlsrsquo secondaries in Scotland ndash is set to close as a result of falling pupil numbers."},{"url":null,"title":"princes-street-evacuation-suspicious-package-found-day-after-glasgow-university-on-lockdown","story":"BREAKING:Glasgow Universityrsquos Dumfries campus evacuated after lsquosuspicious packagersquo found.

It is essential that parents feel they are treated with fairness and equality.“Committee next week therefore provides a welcome opportunity to discuss the general issues.“At the heart of any consideration must be what is best for each inidual child and effective communication to this end between home and school.”A report to members of the local authority’s education and children’s services committee said: “Proponents of the scheme say it allows children to forge closer bonds with their parents, learn about subjects which pique their interest in-depth and have the opportunity to broaden their minds outside the traditional classroom experience.“Opponents of flexi-schooling state this can be confusing for children, put them at a disadvantage when it comes to making school friends and taking standardised exams, and put undue pressure on parents, many of whom know nothing about teaching.”The report said requests need to be considered by the education authority.However, it adds thatthe school does not feel the educational needs of the child will be met, or that it would lead to further costs to the public purse, then these are grounds for refusal.It adds: “Ultimately this is something which would need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis and is not something the education authority can really provide a blanket ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to, as the ultimate decision will depend on the proposal put forward and the overall costs involved.”Council officers have detailed a number of advantages of flexi-schooling within their report, including that it gives younger or less mature children more time to adjust to school.Some parents feel their children are not ready to start full-time school when others do, with the report arguing the move could give them time to “catch up” with their peers.But the disadvantages it puts forward include fears it could affect children’s attainment, especiallythey are not taught in the same way that the school teaches in preparation for assessments and exams.It also adds the option could be unfair on other children who may resent the fact their peers do not have to attend five days of school.Members of the committee will be asked to consider the issues raised and to determine whether the matter should be progressed further when they meet at Woodhill House on Thursday."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/03/5c8b50f1829994.05038528-814x564.jpg ","title":"union terrace gardens contractor to be chosen within

contractor to deliver the long-awaited scheme.Douglas Lumsden, co-leader of the local authority, said the negotiations should conclude within “a week to two weeks”, after committing funding for the project at the budget meeting last week.However, opposition councillors have said there is “still time” to throw the scheme out. vw, px\"  Under their alternative budgets, the SNP and Liberal Democrat

be signed then there is still time for the administration to see sense and not proceed with a project which is already late and massively over budget.“The administration simply can’t justy making cuts to a host of council services while at the same time moving forward with these plans – the public will rightly take a dim view towards this blinkered approach.“I would once again urge them to scrap this vanity project.”Ian Yuill, group leader of the Lib Dems, added that it was “foolish” for the council to spend more than £m on improving the gardens at a time when the council budgets are under pressure.He said: “If money was no object then this scheme might well be the best one but money is and the council should be financially prudent.“They should make the balustrades safe, install suicide

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less.

A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal.

Throughout the day, there was a steady stream of smallish spurs around  to cms to keep everyone occupied, but by far the best fish of the day fell to Andy Jamieson who hooked into a very creditable lb oz thorny.Overall it was a pretty decent day, with  fish comprising spurs, thornback ray, dogfish, whiting and pouting measured and ed.Jim Smith was the winner of the Christmas Shield.Scores: Jim Smith  Gary Sinclair  Robert MacBrayne  Nikki Thompson  Gordon Law  Steven MacBrayne  Andy Jamieson  and John Byrne .PICS:Andy Jamieson with a nice thornback ray. no_aFyneSeaAnglingChristmas in February. no_aFyneSeaAngling"},{"url":null,"title":"macnicol hat trick helps inveraray defeat oban celtic","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsOban Celtic took on premiership opposition, going down - against  Inveraray#s first team at Ganavan.Young Ruaraidh Graham gave Inveraray the lead with a shot from distance which took an awkward bounce on the way in.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"end era popular ayr music","story":"NewsEnd of era as popular Ayr music shop shuts downBig Sparra Vinyl in Ayr has announced its closure following a recent flood at the New Bridge Street store.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  MAR NewsIan Wallace of Big Sparra Vinyl \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt’s the end of an era for a much-loved record store which has touched the hearts- and ears- of many across the country. Big Sparra Vinyl in Ayr has announced its closure following a recent flood at the New Bridge Street store. The record shop has been selling golden oldies and modern mixes for half a decade. And Big Sparra has had its fair share of the limelight as it featured as one of the main filming locations in a TV advert as part of the National Trust for Scotland’s campaign, For the Love of Scotland. The store have been big supporters of annual Record Store Day in the past and even opened at am to allow vinyl collectors to get their hands on limited-edition discs. But it seems it’s not the end for co-owners Robert McKain and Ian Wallace as the pair move on to new ventures, with the latter half of the duo hoping to reopen in the same unit. Robert took to Facebook to tell of the closure and thank their supporters.   He said: “We want to thank all of our customers and friends for their support over the last five years in Ayr. “All hasn’t been plain sailing lately and the recent flood was the catalyst in our decision to close the Ayr store as we know it. “Before we tell you about exciting future plans we just wanted to show our genuine gratitude for making us part of the local community. “To be accepted so warmly really has made our time in Ayr all the more enjoyable. “Rarely in our ten years working together have Ian and I had so many entertaining encounters. “Very sad to end this chapter, even though we are both going on to work on interesting new projects. “Let it be known that it won’t be the last you hear of Ian who plans to reopen in the same unit with a new emporium for gts, some music and coffee.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"iceland home bargains plans approved","story":"NewsIceland and Home Bargains plans approved for Ayr Retail ParkThe stores plan to move into the Heathfield Industrial estate but a meeting heard claims the move could hurt business in Ayr High Street.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  MAR NewsIceland and Home Bargains will move into the former Homebase at Heathfield Retail Park \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRetail giants Home Bargains and Iceland’s Food Warehouse took a step closer to opening at an Ayr retail park The stores plan to move into the Heathfield Industrial estate but a meeting heard claims the move could hurt business in Ayr High Street. Heathfield operator Ediston has applied to alter planning conditions to allow them both to occupy the former Homebase unit. The application got the go-ahead at the South Ayrshire Council Regulatory Panel last week. Discount store Home Bargains sells budget toys, household and beauty and gardening products. The Food Warehouse has a bigger grocery choice than Iceland as well as bulk buys. Ayr Central operators MG Real Estate lodged an objection to the plan. Representing them, Planner Kathryn Donnelly told the meeting: “We believe the proposals could be incorporated into the town centre.” She added: “There is an urgent need to protect Ayr town centre.” Ms Donnelly, of GL Hern, told councillors: “We need to entice national retailers.”   She said Ayr Central supports  local jobs. Ediston representative Alex Mitchell said Food Warehouse would take up , square feet. Mr Mitchell, of Zander Planning, said: “No units like that are available in the town centre.” Claiming it could bolster the town in general, he said: “Retail parks can draw people in from surrounding areas.” A document said the empty Homebase premises were too big for just one shop. Councillors approved requests to allow planning unit to be ided into two shops, and permit homeware goods and food to be sold from it. Councillor Peter Convery said: “There isn’t one of us here who doesn’t want the town centre to be vibrant again.” Expressing his support for the High Street and Heathfield,  chair Councillor Brian Connolly said: “We want them all to be successful.” But Councillor Andy Campbell said: “This has been an opportunity to attract outlets to the town centre. I think we need to attract more to the town centre.” "},{"url":null,"title":"magners cheltenham gold cup preview","story":"NewsMagners Cheltenham Gold Cup Preview Here is chance to pick this years winner before the big raceShareByGary Fanning:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis must be the most mouth-water Cheltenham Gold Cup since the historic heavy weight class between Kauto Star and Denman in .

And they called for better conditions for workers and customers. It is understood Ayr railway station will never operate from the abandoned building again. Now there are plans for Scotrail workers to move into other portable cabins at the bottom of the car park on Station Road. South Ayrshire Council was forced to take control of the privately owned Station Hotel last year when its dilapidated state made it a danger to the public. Station staff were moved to portable cabins beside the building. Mick Hogg, regional organiser for the RMT union in Scotland, said staff working conditions are unacceptable. He said: “We need a facility that is fit for purpose. “We would rather see the building demolished. We want to start from scratch to ensure our members are working in a safe environment.” He added: “Our members and the travelling public should not be subjected to any health and safety risk as a result of this shambles at Ayr Station. The shambles has been created by the refusal of Network Rail and other stakeholders to take ownership of a building that was falling to bits.” Union representatives want workers moved to the better portacable cabins on the other side of the railway tracks as soon as possible. Health and safety rep Willie Harper said: “It has been very challenging.” Gerry McCann, an RMT official from Ayr, said: “The staff are crammed into a portable cabins. There is no fresh running water.” He said facilities were not good enough for rail passengers. People waiting for trains to Glasgow or bus links to the ferries at Cairnryan have no shelter. He said: “People have to stand out in the rain. We want action.” An exclusion zone is in place around parts of the hotel to keep people away from the structure while work proceeds to make it safe. MSP Colin Smyth met the union and Scotrail to make the case for improvements last week. He said: “While staff had to be moved quickly out of offices which were part of the same building as the Station Hotel due to safety fears, the temporary arrangements put in place don’t deliver for staff o.” The council are in discussions with Transport Scotland, Network Rail and Scotrail about the future of the building. A Scotrail spokesman said: “We are committed to providing the best possible working environment for our people. We are working closely with our Network Rail Scotland colleagues and trade union representatives to deliver a long- term solution for the facilities atAyr Station.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScotrailSouth Ayrshire CouncilTransport ScotlandAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"borders-author-wins-2019-bookbug-picture-book-prize","story":"A BORDERS author and childrens book publisher has won the  Bookbug Picture Book Prize.Alan Windrams book, One Button Benny, which was illustrated by Chloe Holwill-Hunter, is the story of a little robot who has a special button that he is only allowed to press in an emergency, and of what happens when he finally has to press his button to help his friends.The winning book was announced in an exclusive video to schools and registered groups in January and presented at a ceremony in Glasgow last week.It was chosen by children across Scotland, aged between three and seven years old, who voted for their favourite via the Scottish Book Trust website.

The objectors also presented evidence to the committee showing how their own planning policies were being ignored by their officials.Peebles Community Council and many residents objected to the land at South Parks site being earmarked for development in the Local Development Plan back in .Mr Turnbull said: ldquoWhat makes objectors particularly annoyed is the notion that once building sites have been included in Local Development Plans, their inclusion cannot be questioned.\"Their views then were ignored just as their views have been totally ignored now. One of the questions that needs to be asked is, why Mr Turnbull said the conduct of the planning committee with the housing application was ldquoappalling and added that the system is loaded in favour of developers.He added: ldquoWell over  dferent objectors submitted some very detailed evidence to planners who ignored it.\"This has brought many objectors to question the validity of the planning process. It would appear that this process is designed to allow developers to build as and when they want and they can appealtheir application is refused.ldquoObjectors on the other hand have no right of appeal given that they have no right of appeal it is surely essential that they are given a fair hearing where evidence is properly considered.ldquoIn the South Parks case, Councillor Fullarton made comments regarding the Caledonian Road being wide and safe, based on his knowledge of over  years ago - no one challenged him.ldquoWhat has caused so much anger was that not a single councillor on the committee knew enough about Peebles to question Councillor Fullartonrsquos assertion. It may be that the planning committee has insufficient time to deal properly with these more complicated and contentious applicationsthat is the case then something has to change.ldquoThey simply failed to understand the issues before them nor the tremendous amount of anger within our community.\"The Scottish Government has launched an initiative called Democracy Matters, which aims to improve the level of involvement of local communities.Mr Turnbull continued: ldquoWhat is the pointplanning officers can write what they want, ignore government guidance and legislation, which is then allowed to stand by councillors who either do not have the knowledge to challenge them or the will to do so. For democracy to matter the peoplesrsquo voice needs to be heard.The community leader says the democratic deficit will be brought into sharp focus with the next Local Development plan, and heeded a warning to elected councillors to be prepared to answer why Peebles is mooted for major development when Scottish Borders Council is not prepared to develop infrastructure first.Scottish Borders Council strongly refutes the claims that councillors and officials ignored the views of the community.A spokesperson said: ldquoAll planning decisions require the delicate balancing of a range of policy objectives and other material factors, including the views expressed by the Community Council.\"The two recent planning applications in Peebles highlighted how dficult that can be and the complexity of the decision making process. Both proposals were subject to detailed analysis, which was reflected in the presentation of the cases by officers and the y debate members had on these applications.ldquoIt is clear that a considerable amount of time was spent considering the points and issues made both for and against the proposed developments. Indeed, both applications were revised to take into consideration the views expressed by local residents and the Community Council.ldquoUltimately, and after considering all of the evidence before them, the Committee came to the view that it could support one of the applications, which was the development at South Parks.

There will be easy climbing, and therersquos two possible loops one at Ladhope and one at Langlee, so there is good potential at both ends for family route.ldquoThe other type of route we call lsquofit familyrsquo. Higher grade cycling, running, and walking, on higher ground.ldquoTherersquos loads of potential, itrsquos a big area, the views are fantastic, and people will want to get up there. The only dficulty at the moment is getting up the steep slopes.ldquoSo the bulk of the multi use trail network will be building easy climb trails to get people to the top without too much stress.However, horse riders have voiced concerns over the plans which will could see more mountain bikes sharing the paths with horse riders.And local residents Diane Leaver and Susan Burrow, both of Langlee Mains, attended the meeting.Ms Leaver told councillors: ldquoWersquove already had a handful of incidents with bikes coming down the road to Langlee Mains fast and with dferent residents coming round a steep corner, and the bikes coming the other way.ldquoFortunately they have been far enough away to be able to stop so there hasnrsquot been an accident yet, but, you cannot see cars coming up until yoursquore almost at the junction.Ms Burrow added: ldquoThe main concern is the specic mountain bike tracks, because although where they join the core paths there will be bits for them to slow up, Irsquom not sure that will be enough.,params: .pushldquoMy question is, will I be able to rise safely  Sometimes when wersquore riding along they go lsquooff-pistersquo so to speak, and so therefore therersquos nothing to slow them up.Galashiels and District councillor Harry Scott also voice concerns at the plans, but his main concern is that there isnrsquot ample parking for visitors.He told the committee: ldquoI have mixed feelings about this, Irsquoll be honest with you. The Langlee Woods is very popular with walkers, and cyclists, and I know therersquos a good and a bad with everything and some of the cyclists come down the tracks without any idea of where theyrsquore going and who might be going to meet them.ldquoThe other thing that concerns is me is that in Langlee and Ladhope golf course, I donrsquot want to see any parking in these areas.ldquoIt has to be discouraged. The road up to Langlee Mains Farm is not suitable for the type of cycles yoursquore talking about, itrsquos a narrow, twisty road with zones of invisibility.ldquoIf there is to be parking, I suggest you look where.Councillors voted unanimously to submit the plans to the public for consultation, and for a report to be brought back to the committee in the future.Council officers also confirmed that the trail network will require planning permission, which will give residents a second opportunity to submit their thoughts on the development."},{"url":null,"title":"iceland-store-boss-admits-ignoring-21-parking-tickets","story":"A SUPERMARKET manager has been hit with a four figure bill after ignoring a y string of parking tickets.David Humphries car was frequently ticketed over several months after being parked in a pay and display area behind the Iceland store in High Street, Galashiels, where he works.But the -year-old never paid the tickets or answered letters from the Scottish Borders Council asking him to reveal the identication of the driver, so the fines could be sent to the culprit.Now he has been fined a whopping pound, for ignoring the council letters - pound for each offence - and there is still a pound bill outstanding for the  original parking offences between April and July last year.Humphries of Bourtree Place, Hawick, pleaded guilty at Selkirk JP Court to a total of  charges.Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser told the court that there was no CCTV in the car park showing who had come to collect the car on the days of the offences and Humphries had never informed the council of the identity of the driver despite the repeated requests.But he pointed out Humphries worked in the Iceland store which is right beside the High Street car park.Mr Fraser also said that failing to reveal the identity of the driver carried a maximum penalty of pound, for each offence.He explained that the council had to go through the laborious process of establishing who the regular keeper of the vehicle was and to find out who the driver was for the penalty to be paid.Mr Fraser said:\"In relation to all these charges he ignored the correct parking penalty which was not paid.\"There were other people who could have used this car parkspace but have not been able to do so.\"The accuseds vehicle repeatedly committed the offences of being parked overtime.\"Who did that we do not know as the accused did not bother to communicate with the council and say who the driver was which is a legal requirement.\"Not guilty pleas to nine other charges relating to the parking offences were accepted by the Crown.Defence lawyer Colin Severin said his client was negotiating with the council about the outstanding parking fines.He added: \"He got to the point where he was bogged down with the volume of letters coming through and did not know how to react.\"Andrew Bramhall JP told Humphries that ulging the identity of the identity of the driver when an offence is committed was an important part of the Road Traffic Act legislation.He said: \"The onus was on you and it has mounted up considerably.\"Mr Bramhall said he would have fined Humphries pound for each offence but restricted the fine to pound due to the guilty plea.As there were  offences, the fine totalled pound - and Humphries, who earns pound, a year from his salary as the Iceland store manager - was allowed to pay it off in instalments of pound a month.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said afterwards: \"This court case sends out a message that Scottish Borders Council will take action against drivers who fail to pay a parking charge issued in any of our Pay and Display car parks.\"To avoid matters going to court, drivers should pay a parking charge notice within the -day deadline.\"Alternatively, to avoid a penalty altogether, simply pay the appropriate parking fee for your vehicles stay.\"It is also a criminal offence for the keeper of a vehicle to fail to give the identication of the driver to the Councila parking charge notice has been issued.\"If anyone is concerned about an outstanding parking charge notice they have received please contact the Councils parking team on    or visit our website.\""},{"url":null,"title":"gala-man-made-156-calls-to-his-ex-in-one-day","story":"A Galashiels man telephoned his former partner  times on the day after she broke up with him, Selkirk Sherf Court has been told.When the woman finally answered Jamie West made comments about slashing her daughters throat and posting the blood through the letter box.The -year-old of Beech Avenue, pleaded guilty to a charge of behaving in a threatening or abusive manner last month.Sherf Donald Corke expressed concern about the content of the comments and deferred sentence so that a non-harassment protection order can be considered."},{"url":null,"title":"travelodge-wants-to-open-hotel-in-galashiels","story":"TRAVELODGE wants to open a hotel in Galashiels.The chain, is looking to boost its current portfolio to by adding  new hotels across Scotland.And it wants to build a pound million budget hotel in the Borders, creating  jobs.The firm has expressed interest in the region previously.And Galashiels has been mentioned again by bosses in theirlatest expansion plans.Pascal Bamford, from Travelodge said: ldquoDespite the current economic market we are expanding our network of hotels across Scotland and were delighted to open our th Scottish Travelodge in Glasgow by the famous Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.\"Scotland is growing from strength to strength and is a top Staycation destination therefore to meet growing demand post Brexit we are looking for a further  hotel sites across the country which includes Galashiels.\"Collectively this expansion programme represents an investment of pound million for third party investors and job creation of .\"Galashiels, right in the heart of the Scottish Borders with its beautul countryside has been selected as one of our key locations.\"We are actively looking for the ideal site to open the townrsquos first branded budget hotel.\"This will represent an investment of pound million and a job creation of .\"Itrsquos also great news for the local economy as Travelodge customers spend double their room rate with local businesses during their stay which equates to a multi-million spend annually.\""},{"url":null,"title":"folk-stars-kathryn-and-sean-set-for-st-boswells-live","story":"DUOS come and duos go.And some nurture and fine-tune their art and watch it grow into something totally original, captivating and award-winning.Bonded by an unseen alchemy, Kathryn Roberts and Sean Lakeman have entwined their professional and personal relationship into an enviable class act of imaginative songwriting and musicianship.And you can witness this chemistry up close at St Boswells Live next month.The Dartmoor-based husband and we have twice won the coveted Best Duo title at the BBC Radio  Folk Awards , consistently delivering assured, distinctive performances whether live or recorded.Over two decades of performance they have never been trapped in a groove ndash always bold and innovative, mixing traditional song arrangements with their self-penned material which reels from the bitter to the sweet, the wry to the sad, the political to the passive. across folk, rock, country and blues genres.Last year Kathryn Roberts and Sean Lakeman presented lsquoPersonaersquo -

After his first two space launch attempts ended in failure, it is no surprise that Elon Musk#s SpaceX recently took a dummy to the International Space Station.Solo ocean crossings in a sailing boat are another example of a sport that seems too risky to many.Free Solo tells of Honnold#s perfectionism but ultimately he relies on  practice, friction, magnesium carbonate chalk for his sweaty palms and his wits.Throughout the ascent, and the preamble which leads to it, including romance and his girlfriend#s struggle #to understand#, Honnold is filmed by his friends, some of whom cannot bear to watch the final solo.Extreme solo feats have existed as long as humans. The marathon developed in Ancient Greece as a solo running challenge and people still die in the st century emulating those barefoot warriors.Climbing and mountaineering has a long history of solo risk taking and many of its protagonists live relatively short lives.Some though, such as legendary Italian Walter Bonatti, were hard wired for solitary ascents. He shot to fame in the s with a solo ascent of a climb on the Dru, renamed the Bonatti Pillar, in the French alps.Bonatti finished his hard climbing career in  with a solo in winter of the north face of the Matterhorn for the centenary of that mountain#s first attempt. He passed away, aged , in bed.Up till Free Solo, many films about climbing have only been of real interest to climbers and have not made it into mainstream cinema.Using the latest techniques including drones, remote cameras, huge telephoto lenses on digital cameras from the valley floor and cameras wielded by dangling climbers has created a National Geographic movie which has transfixed audiences.Even climbers emerge after an-hour-and-a-half with sweaty palms after the glimpse into Honnold#s seemingly nihilistic world.A still of Alex Honnold during his climb.

Craig Galbraith worked well playing with, eventual man of the match, Calum Johnson for the first time.In the th minute there was a skirmish in the box after a corner, Johnson cleared the ball but it ricocheted off the incoming player into the net.The Glasgow students had more possession with the wind advantage. With  minutes left, a tremendous fingertip save, by Neil McMillan, pushed the ball over the bar.With four minutes left the away side put the game beyond #Dale#s reach when Matthew Lamont tried to clear a corner shot but unforunately scored an own goal.In high winds and driving rain the game fizzled out.Both sides had played well in the conditions and kept the ball on the deck in addition, referee, Archie Mitchell said it was an easy game to ref with no bad tackles.The match ball was sponsored by Wee Toon Sports and a Carradale spokesperson thanked Food for Thought for the post match hospitality.Tomorrow Carradale travels to Helensburgh for an early kick off at noon."},{"url":null,"title":"kspbs novice b band impresses","story":"Last Sunday#s Livingston performance was the first time a pipe band of any grade from Campbeltown has taken part in these championships and it was dficult for them to know what to expect.The band was in a category of  others and they needed a good performance, to get a place, as there were a number of top bands playing.Kintyre Schools Band, the top band from a non-fee-paying school, gave a great performance playing Sweet Maid of Glendarual, Greenwood side, Fairwell to Aberdeen and Campbell’s Fairwell to Redcastle.After everyone had played it was over to the judges and the Novice B band was placed as follows: piping adjudicatorone: J Wilson # , PA two:  J Connor-, drumming adjudicator: A Dudgeon-, ensemble adjudicator-D Brown-.When added together this gave the Campbeltown band a total of  points and gave them a very credible fourth place and only two points off the second placed band.After the results were confirmed Pipe Major Fiona Mitchell said how proud she was of her young band and thought th place was a very good start to the season.Both KPBA bands, KSPB and Beinn an Tuirc Kintyre are now practicing hard for the first major pipe band competition of the season when the bands perform at the British Championships in Paisley on Saturday May .KSPB Novice B band perform at Livingston.

which the papers were presented this year which made alternative motions possible.However what did this year yield.The main dferences in the budget came down to the administration of the council proposing £, more for winter gritting, outwith the A which is covered by the contract with BEAR.This was against cuts in the road safety unit, an award winning safety programme for young children, a cut in youth and adult learning, a cut in environmental warden services, which means a focus on more fines but less time for fly tipping and dog fouling and a cut to music tuition in schools.There were amendments lodged by Councillor Donald Kelly and myself the SNP group and Councillors George Freeman and Jean Moffat.While gritting our roads is important CouncillorKelly and I along with other council opposition groups thought the other considerations were important to our communities which strangely enough is also supported by our corporate plan.Alas the gritting won the day.Full motions and votes can be found on the council website.However it was more disappointing that Councillor Kelly and I included in our motion a scheme to change funding due for Helensburgh and Dunoon.Just more than £ million would be moved to the regeneration project of Tarbert Lochgilphead Ardrishaig.This was defeated by the rest of the council which was particularly galling.Money for Helensburgh had been

very happy at inveraray meeting","story":"The man behind controversial plans to bring a long-extinct cat to the forests of Kintyre said he was #very happy# with an Inveraray consultation day.Farmers, though, were less impressed.Dr Paul O#Donoghue and his Lynx UK Trust hopes to bring lynx # a cat around the size of a German shepherd dog # to Kintyre as one of three trial sites in Scotland.Dr O#Donoghue, the trust#s chief scientic advisor, was at Inveraray church hall for the public event on Tuesday March  after a late change from Tarbert.The move, however, failed to stop a number of farmers from across Argyll, Kintyre included, travelling to voice concerns.The Lynx Trust is looking for a licence to bring four female and two male lynx to Kintyre for a five-year trial. By the end of this period, Dr O#Donoghue estimates there could be up to  animals in the region.Claiming  per cent public support, the Lynx Trust says there would be #zero risk# to humans and that across Europe lynx kill on average . sheep per lynx per year. This predation level is dismissed by farmers who say this Europe-wide figure means little as it includes areas where no lynx are present.Dr O#Donoghue said that roe deer make up around  per cent of the diet of a lynx, but farmers are concerned that control by forest managers has left the deer population particularly low, leaving sheep as an obvious alternative prey.His Kintyre plans are at the #very early stages#, said Dr O#Donoghue, and the potential of #numerous sites# was being assessed.The farmers who came along were far from convinced by Dr O#Donoghue#s claims. One left the hall with fists clenched in frustration saying: #There#s no point in talking to that man. He is not listening to us.#Dr O#Donoghue said he was #very happy with the way things went#. He continued: #It played out exactly as expected, with concerns being raised from the sheep farming community and support being given from other sectors.#The chairman of NFU Scotland#s environment and land use committee is Oban farmer Angus MacFadyen. He told the Advertiser: #I#ve got great concerns about where this project may lead and what effect it could have on the environment as well as the local farming community.#As farmers, we are the people who look after most of the environment in this area and that includes ground-nesting birds, squirrels, wildcats and many other species. We#re trying to improve and maintain that and what we don#t need is an apex predator coming in and affecting it.#Asked why the trust had changed venue for the event, Dr O#Donoghue replied: #Inveraray is a very accessible place and allowed good attendance, which was evidenced by the number of people there.

Many new SNP supporters I talked to in the course of the campaign and afterwards had described their support for independence in messianic terms. Their conversion had been Damascene and they had begun the task of evangelising work colleagues, and family members. The struggle for Scotlandrsquos soul was fought in book-clubs, walking groups and pubs. My own dear -year-old mum, an avowed Unionist, was persuaded away from her perfidious beliefs by my two daughters who felt that her conversion was a sacred cause. She still has the Yes stickers in her window and asks me every week when the next referendum will be.Having gone through these le-altering, almost religious encounters, itrsquos entirely understandable and predictable why you would want to repeat them as soon as you could. It seemed good to be alive then ndash defeat or no defeat.Here we are though five years later and elections and referendums have come and gone at a bewildering rate and, for the first time in UK political history, a signicant portion of the population now knows what those four people who bustle through the isions at Westminster do. Mr Speaker, John Bercow is so popular hersquoll soon be hosting game shows and the BBC is already wondering how they are going to replace Andrew Neil. In American politics every day is a pantomime as the delinquent in the White House comes more and more to resemble the Manchurian Candidate. In Scotland the numbers for independence remain stubbornly defiant and other surveys indicating that a clear majority of Scots would prefer independence than exiting the EU with no deal.At next monthrsquos SNP Spring conference Nicola Sturgeon and her ministers will encounter squallsthey attempt foolishly to silence the increasingly siren calls to strike early for a second referendum. There are several sources for such optimism. As well as the numbers for independence averaging about %recent major oil discoveries have settled any fears that these reserves will have an advantageous impact on our post-independence economy. Independence supporters are fond of saying Scotland is the only country in the world which discovered oil and became poorer.Itrsquos also the only country in the world with an entire class of media and political commentators who say that oil is nothing to write home about and that itrsquos actually a burden. Happily though, the BBC, after several years, have stopped using the annual GERS numbers as a propaganda tool for the Union and started introducing some long overdue nuance to this hazy snapshot of our economy which fails to factor in, ahem ... independence and its dferent spending choices and priorities.The case for striking out early for a referendum is further buttressed by the serial and endemic incompetence of the Labour Party in Scotland. Surely, they will begin to make a recovery soon. They wonrsquot though not when they always seem to choose the janitor to run the school.And then there is Brexit, the great gt that many nationalists believe just keeps giving. Highlights from this weekrsquos Westminster convulsions should be gathered up by the SNPrsquos social media specialists and retained for use across all s when the time comes. Two very clear patterns emerged this week and neither of them is pretty. Itrsquos clear that Theresa May is becoming increasingly detached from reality and, I fear, to the detriment of her physical health and perhaps more. Her party has been given over to the whims of its howling whim and other night-time creatures.Each time her ministers face the microphone you find yourself trying to decipherthis is a serious comment about breaking the Brexit logjam or an early attempt at a leadership bid. Meanwhile, the Scottish voters who opted to remain in the EU are reminded every night that their fate is in the hands of a gang of political flat-earthers from Ulster. At one point Andrew Neil, while interviewing Nigel Farage in Brussels, seemed to be suggesting to him that he might want to speak to his far-right compadre, Matteo Salvini, the deputy Prime Minister of Italy. If Italy vetoed Britainrsquos Brexit extension plans then a no-deal scenario could present itself. I swear I could hear chops being licked.The other pattern is an old and continuing one: the contempt of Westminster for anything remotely to do with Scotland. Jeremy Corbyn dismissed any talk about Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its will and inevitable calls in the face of this for a second referendum as ldquoan irrelevance. The BBC now routinely refuses to permit coverage of SNP responses following important Commons votes on Brexit. Throughout the entire Brexit process, Mrs May and her ministers have treated the Scottish Government with disdain and ignored them at every opportunity, even when it has suggested routes that might help her. One observer told me that attempting to discuss anything with the UK Prime Minister is like sitting at traffic lights that will always be fixed at red.Letrsquos not be impatient Scotland can afford to wait a little while longer for a second referendum. This cast of political freaks and curiosities will remain with us for a while yet and, as this week has shown, they will think nothing of bring the UK to its kneesit suits their narrow agendas.

Donald Dewar, then the MP for Aberdeen South, took his seat, close to Teddy Taylor, the MP for Glasgow Cathcart.The woman they had come to remember at this requiem mass on Monday, June , , lived just  yards from the Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in Balornock. Her name was Alice Cullen, the first Roman Catholic woman to enter the House of Commons. She was the MP for the Gorbals, and her death occurred  years ago this May.Archbishop James Donald Scanlan told the congregation that Mrs Cullen was \"a woman, the likes of whom Glasgow will never see again.\" He declared that the presence of the Secretary of State \"and all the other dignitaries ... is an indication of the high esteem in which she was held by all.\" To her grandchildren, and all children ndash Mrs Cullen, who was twice married, had three daughters ndash the archbishop urged them to follow the example she had set in devoting so much of her le to serving the community.Alice Cullen might not warrant a mention in, say, the Oxford Companion to Twentieth Century British Politics, or in many political memoirs of the era, but she has a full entry in the first volume of Honourable Ladies: Portraits of Women MPs. Journalist Sarah Mackinlay notes at the outset that Cullens political career was dedicated to improving living standards of the Gorbals people ndash \"especially the woefully inadequate housing in which many lived. The Gorbals was notorious as one of the most deprived parts of the UK, home to Britains worst slums.\"Cullens by-election victory in September  may have owed something to an intervention by the then Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, who urged voters not to be distracted by the \"red herrings\" of the Communist and Conservative Unionist candidates.When Cullen made her maiden speech in the Commons in December , she took Gorbals housing as her subject. \"EvenI were a great orator,\" she said at one point, \"it would be quite impossible for me adequately to describe the slum conditions of my constituency.\" Nevertheless, she gave a persuasive picture of local housing conditions. \"There are many families living in dilapidated, tumble-down, rat-infested buildings,\" she declared. \"The latest statistics show that slightly over , families live in one-apartment houses. Nearly , families live in two-apartment housesNo constituency in Glasgow was worse than the Gorbals, she added. To her, the apartments were mere \"dens.\" She appealed to the Scots secretary, \"from the bottom of my heart\" for him, together with the local authorities, to make a survey of the Gorbals \"with a view to finding a site on which a block of flats might be erected. I have no doubt that such a site could be found for this purpose. I ask him to make a start in the Gorbals, which is the greatest slum menace that I have ever known.\"Due to her tireless efforts in Parliament over the decades, Sarah Mackinlay writes, \"more than  acres of slums were demolished and, by the s, were replaced with modern housing and flats.\"In all, Cullen fought and won no fewer than seven general elections, proof of the high regard in which her voters held her.In November  she said she would stand down at the next election. Her last recorded question in the Commons occurred on March , , on the subject of the jubilee year of the Forestry Commission.Her death at the age of  made the front page of the Glasgow Herald on May , . The article said she had been recently been taken ill while ing to Glasgow from Westminster and had appeared to make a good recovery in hospital. A local Gorbals councillor said: \"Gorbals has lost a great friend. Many, many people in the constituency owe a great deal to Mrs Cullen.\"Alice Cullen was the maternal grandmother of Elizabeth Cairns, who lives today in Bishopbriggs.passed away.She was very young when Cullen died ndash her own mother died later that same year ndash but she nevertheless has many fond memories of her.She has photographs and home cine-films of Alice Cullen with her family. Theres a picture of wedding, the guests apparently including Bessie Braddock, the campaigning Labour MP. Theres a photograph of Cullen with the Queen at a ceremony in the Gorbals. Somewhere there is a CD recording of that  maiden speech, and, possibly, even a black-edged postcard from Jacqueline Kennedy in response to a letter from Cullen, in which she expressed her condolences on the death of her husband, John F Kennedy, in Dallas in .And, intriguingly, there are some of the MPs prized possessions. There is a copy of Attlees  autobiography, As It Happened, the flyleaf of which bears the signatures not only of Attlee but also of other leading figures in the Labour Party: Hugh Gaitskell, party leader Harold Wilson, Prime Minister between  to  and  to  Herbert Morrison, whose many posts included Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary and Jim Callaghan, the partys last Prime Minister before Tony Blair took office in .Theres also a teapot, inscribed \"To Alice, from her Women Colleagues in the House of Commons with warmest good wishes.\" It is dated December , . Theres a Christmas card from Harold and Mary Wilson, too.Lord Snowden, no less, once took a photograph of a group of a dozen prominent female MPs. Dated sometime in , it shows Cullen alongside other notables: Bessie Braddock, Judith Hart, MargaretHerbison and Barbara Castle.\"My mother died of pancreatic cancer in December ,\" says Elizabeth. \"She was in terrible pain but she apparently gave a eulogy for Alice at the Immaculate Heart despite being in such agony.\"I have very vivid memories of my grandmother. She used to come from Parliament and sneak up to see me, and waken me. She would kid on that she was going upstairs for the bathroom. Shed come in and ask me what Id learned at nursery. We were always giggling and laughing.\"I remember all the family parties where everybody, of course, is smoking in a tiny room.\"Alice really was the most generous person. You couldnt say you liked something, like thats a nice brooch, or watch and when you got home youd find it in your bag. Thats the type of person she was.\"She had no interest in material things. She wouldnt covet things or hold onto them. My mum said it got to the point where nobody would ever say such-and-such a thing was nice, because she would just give it to them.\"Alice had two sisters, Sarah and Annie, who both moved to England, leaving Alice behind in Glasgow. Elizabeth remembers growing up in a political family. One of Alices sisters once voted for Margaret Thatcher, \"because she thought it was quite nice for a woman to get in, and that caused an absolute war in the house.\"Alice, she adds, had a \"real moral conscience. She would have been turning in her grave at the thought of what happened with MPs and their expenses. She was a person of a high moral code, and I think thats our family as well.\"I remember that she was full of fun. Shes been described as a foreboding figure but that wasnt my experience of her at all. She didnt allow children to behave badly or in a spoiled way. She would correct you with a look.\"She took a genuine interest in handicapped childrens welfare, and family poverty and health issues and nurses rights. She also spoke up forcefully on things like the crisis in care for the elderly. All of these subjects are sadly still relevant today to too many people.She would been out in George Square in Glasgow, doing her things with all the other people campaigning on things like equal pay. A lot of the things she was interested in and spoke up for are still relevant today, and that is sad. But it proves how far ahead of her time my grandmother was.\"Alice Cullens maiden speech, House of Commons, December , :\"I am glad to be given the opportunity of making my maiden speech on housing, a subject of paramount interest to the people whom I have the honour to represent. I feel sure that I shall be given the same courteous and favourable hearing as is usually given to hon. Members when they are making their maiden speeches. I want to confine my arguments to the constituency which I represent. The people of Gorbals are, no doubt, known to hon. Members of this House through the play \"The Gorbals Story.\" The Gorbals people are hard-working, decent citizens, but at the present time they are depressed and disheartened because of the conditions in which they are living. There are many families living in dilapidated, tumble-down, rat-infested buildings.\"I should like to give some figures which will demonstrate the appalling lack of proper housing accommodation. The latest statistics show that slightly over , families live in one-apartment houses. Nearly , families live in two-apartment houses. For those who have never experienced living in such conditions, it is dficult to imagine the tragedy and the misery of living, eating and sleeping all in the one apartment, especially when the family consists of anything up to eight members, while sometimes in two-apartment houses it is as high as  members. I am sorry to say that amongst these families are many young people in their teens suffering from tuberculosis.\"There are also in my constituency , houses of one or two apartments which have been scheduled as unfit for human habitation and are still occupied yet because of the shocking neglect of the housing needs of the people of my area, they must continue to be occupied. EvenI were a great orator, it would be quite impossible for me adequately to describe the slum conditions of my constituency. Thousands of young men from Gorbals answered the call in the - war, and their sons in the - war did likewise. They fought for a better way of le, for decent homes in which to rear their families and for a certain amount of home le, of which they are now deprived. They have waited in vain for that result. It is true to say that  families from the Gorbals have been housed, but the tragedy of that is that when these families were transferred to new houses, instead of the tumble-down shacks being demolished they were allowed to be reoccupied.\"That is how conditions are in my area. I do not blame the Government. Like my hon. Friend who has already spoken, I think the Government have done a great job of work in regard to housing during the last few years, but I feel that many working people in my own constituency have been neglected for nearly  years. When materials and labour were both plentul and cheap, the Government of that day did not think fit to start to remedy the slums and do something for the people living in them, and in particular for the Gorbals constituency, which is, I maintain, the worst in the whole city of Glasgow.\"My appeal to the Secretary of State for Scotland, from the bottom of my heart, is that he should, in conjunction with the local authorities, make a survey of the Gorbals with a view to finding a site on which a block of flats might be erected. I have no doubt that such a site could be found for this purpose. I ask him to make a start in the Gorbals, which is the greatest slum menace that I have ever known.\"I was elected to this House on th September and I took my seat on th October. During the first fortnight that I was here, the Press made vicious attacks upon me because I had not spoken in this House about the housing conditions of my people, and especially Mr. Cummings of the News Chronicle, who seemed to think that had I got up in this House and thrown a fit of hysteria, some fairy would have waved a wand and all would have been well in the Gorbals. That does not happen. I appeal to the Joint Under-Secretary of State to do his best to make the survey for which I have asked. We are coming near to Christmas thousands of my people have still to spend Christmas in their dens. The only way I can express myself is by calling their apartments dens. I trust that, in this holy season of Christmas, the season of good will towards men, my appeal will be successful and that by next year, quite a large number of my folk will be able to spend Christmas in much brighter and happier homes.\""},{"url":null,"title":"bbc-alba-give-us-same-chance-to-shine-as-new-channel","story":"Bosses at MG Alba, which operates BBC Alba in partnership with the BBC, said

officers, was “unprecedented” in terms of the extent of problems for private water supplies.The £, the council spent on providing intermediate bulk containers and bottled water for those in need, is

private water supplies – the largest number of any local authority area in Scotland.While the upkeep of private water supplies is the responsibility of the property owner or landowner, supplies are vulnerable to fluctuations in quality and quantity, and are often not adequately maintained.In his letter to Ms Cunningham, Councillor Argyle states: “The public supply has many advantages over private water supplies and the overall aim should be to see as many properties as possible connected to the mains network.“The mains network should be extended to enable connections to be made, thereby reducing the number of properties on private supplies.“While it is recognised that it will not be possible to connect all properties to the public supply there are particular clusters of properties where it would be possible to do so.”The council also wants to see property owners being better educated in terms of water usage and a simplication of Scottish Water’s process forthose

We feel this is a real opportunity to clamp down on the issue once and for all.”Details are available by emailing emma.harper.msp@parliament.scot or at www.emmaharpermsp.scot livestock-worrying .data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Fears over traffic congestion may be unfounded as work takes place overnight.\"  Busy north-east road to close for repairs viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"climate week north east offers range of events to inspire","story":"Would you like to take part in woodland conservation, or are you wondering how you can live more sustainably Climate Week North East is back to inspire you from March -, with a range of events happening across Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen City.Designed to raise awareness of climate change, this event will highlight the simple and fun steps we as iniduals can make to reduce our own carbon footprint.Alison Stuart, of Aberdeen Climate Action, says: “There are so many amazing sustainability projects going on here in the north east and it is community action which is driving them.“Climate Week is a fantastic opportunity to showcase those projects, gain recognition for the wonderful work they do and inspire others to create their own projects, or simply make a change in the way they live their lives.”Vice-chair of Aberdeenshire Council’s Sustainability Committee, Isobel Davidson, said: “It is inspiring to see the range of activities on offer across the week in Aberdeenshire, highlighting the simple steps we all can take to become more sustainable.“There is plenty to get involved with: helping to place bird and bat boxes, celebrating our food and drink and lots of family-friendly sessions.

This underlines the importance of the value we place on meeting our environmental obligations as we plan and construct new infrastructure. This book, which provides valuable details on the archaeological finds, will be essential reading for everyone who has an interest in the North-East’s history.”Bruce Mann, Archaeologist for the council, explained: “This book provides more details on our fascinating discoveries from the archaeological works carried out on the AWPR site. For instance, a very unexpected discovery was the presence of Roman activity at Milltimber, likely dating from around   AD. Ninety bread ovens were uncovered, which were probably constructed by the Roman army at a time of invasion led by the Roman General Agricola. However, no evidence of an associated camp was found, which is unusual for these types of features. We can only speculate as to why the ovens were in this location.“Going back to the very earliest finds, there was also evidence of stone tool production dating between about , and , BC at Milltimber, a near unprecedented body of evidence which pushes back our understanding of human activity in north east Scotland by several thousand years.”Bruce continued:“Bronze Age activity was identied from Nether Beanshill in the form of a roundhouse and contemporary cremation complex dating from around , to , BC. The burial comprised of an urn in which the cremated remains of an inidual in their s had been placed. This urn was placed in a pit which was then marked by a horseshoe-shaped arrangement of timber posts. Two other similar burials were also uncovered.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Gillian Martinwith Emma Harper, who launched the public consultation exercise.\"   with Emma Harper, who launched the public consultation exercise.\"  Public urged to have a say on legislation viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"volunteers sought to help tree research","story":"An appeal has gone out to local nature lovers to help with a national science project which aims to monitor the health of the country#s trees.The Woodland Trust is on the look-out for volunteer tree health surveyors to support Observatree – a UK-wide partnership project that tracks tree pests and diseases across the UK.The trust is recruiting the volunteers, and will teach them how to identy threats such as ash dieback, acute oak decline and Asian longhorn beetle, before reporting to Forest Research.Since its launch in , the project has trained  volunteers, who have given more than , hours of their time and , site surveys have been conducted, of which more than , found a tree pest or disease.In Scotland only the central belt is currently well covered by volunteers but more are needed where – including the North-east.Charlotte Armitage, citizen science officer at the Woodland Trust, said that volunteers are a key part of the scheme.She continued: “Observatree volunteers are instrumental in tracking pests and diseases– they need strong tree ID skills and an enthusiasm for nature to drive investigations across the UK.“However, we still need more people to join our ranks.

We have been sharing information to help the sector prepare for that scenario.#However, Mr Carmichael is standing by his claims, saying behind the scenes analysis is a totally dferent level of depth than the full impact assessment expected to be done on such a massive change.He has branded conservative ministers #woefully irresponsible# for #failing to safeguard the sector from the impact of Brexit.#Speaking while making his claims, earlier in the week, prior to the response from DEFRA, Mr Carmichael said: #When Conservatives think of farmers, they think of the big landowners and the estates This [FOI] response shows that they have no interest in, or concern for, the hill farmers and crofters whose businesses are the backbone of so many of our remote rural communities.#To run their business, farmers need certainty. They need to know what funding is available, what standards must be met and what tarfs need to be paid.#It is therefore appalling that Conservative ministers have failed to conduct an impact assessment on the impact of Brexit on sheep farming. These ministers are woefully irresponsible. Farmers deserve better.#“Behind the scenes analysis falls well short of the in-depth impact assessment that farmers and crofters deserve. It is like not doing your homework, but trying to cover the fact by saying that you put together a mind map. Simply unacceptable. By the government’s own admission, they have done nothing, and know of no work to do an impact assessment on the industry.“They have let the industry, and our farming and crofting communities down.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Brexit is in the hands of  people in Westminster, each seemingly with their own agenda which the Government has been powerless to control, but  people in the City Chambers have decided the tram completion should go ahead no matter what it costs or how long it takes.: Edinburgh trams: Councillors approve controversial £m tram extensionMuch was made on Thursday about how robust and reliable the new contracts will be, using standard industry approaches which will avoid the disputes which caused so much dficulty last time around. That is true, but clarity of agreement and the avoidance of dispute is not a guarantee that costs will not rise once the unknowns become known as Leith’s mediaeval streets and Georgian harbour are excavated.This will not matter because when the work starts on Leith Walk again a second halt is inconceivable evenmajor problems arise, as they inevitably will. Nothing from the city administration’s arguments on Thursday suggested that cost was in any way a consideration which could override the wider goals it has set itself and the contractors know this. It is the council’s equivalent of removing ‘no deal’ from any future negotiations about cost over-runs.And as the council enters into an open-ended spending commitment, another hoped-for source of income is disappearing over the horizon. Speaking at the Scottish Tourism Alliance conference, Culture and Tourism Secretary Fiona Hyslop described the sector as “fragile”, citing Brexit uncertainty and making it clear the Scottish Government will take its time to consult on the tourism tax that Edinburgh hopes to introduce.: Edinburgh tram extension: arguments for and against“The requirement to consider legislation means that there will be no tourism tax levied in  or indeed  season, as consultation, legislation and indeed implementationany council wants to introduce a tax, will take some time,” she said.It might not be much of a punt, but I’ll put my money on Brexit happening long before the Newhaven tram or the tourist tax.Who knew what about sex abuse As a cub reporter on the now defunct Chester Observer, I spoke to the late MP Sir Peter Morrison a couple of times, always on the phone and usually when he was in the back of an official car somewhere in Westminster. The calls always finished off with a cheery “We must meet up when I’m back in Chester”, which in the office was greeted with a nudge-nudge because rumours about his sexual preferences were widespread.The paper folded in , three years after I left, but this week it has resurfaced in the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse with a new allegation that reporters on the paper and the other two serving the city covered up allegations of child sex abuse against him, particularly an incident involving a -year-old boy in the toilets of Crewe Station sometime in the late s.As with so many historic abuse allegations, getting to the truth about the actions of people who are dead is not easy, and similarly allegations that journalists colluded in a cover-up will be equally hard to establish because again so many of them, on the Observer at least, are also dead.Former MP Christine Russell, who was one of my best contacts, told the inquiry that “every reporter on the local press knew of these allegations” and I don’t doubt that is true. The inquiry has heard about the close relationship between the Observer and the local Conservative Party but the chief reporter’s closest relationship was with the Liberals. She passed away some years ago but her best contact, Lib Dem peer Andrew Stunnell who fought two general elections against Morrison, might be able to shed light on what she had heard.Hearing and proving are two dferent thingsNot that the Lib Dems need to get embroiled in any more allegations of sex abuse cover-ups, but the suspension of Lord Steel from the party over claims he was involved in burying accusations abuse against Sir Cyril Smith is a sad but inevitable consequence of the need not just for thorough investigation, but of the need to demonstrate that no matter how long ago these incidents may have occurred the organisations themselves have changed.The unacceptable way allegations against Smith, Morrison and, of course, Jimmy Savile were handled by the authorities were very much signs of their times. But, then as now, for journalists it’s all very well hearing about something, but having enough proof to withstand a defamation action is another thing entirely.Calling ****s over Scotland namesThe Nationalist “Wings over Scotland” blogger Stuart Campbell is currently suing former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale for defamation and is seeking £, damages because she used her Daily Record column to describe a message he posted on social media about Scotland Secretary David Mundell and his son Oliver as “homophobic”.Mr Campbell is known for his strident social media posts about Unionists and Unionism during the Yes campaign which, according to its digital chief Stewart Kirkpatrick, were unhelpful.Mr Kirkpatrick, the former editor of Scotsman, said: “Are we talking about the Wings over Scotland who is the data-driven journalist, who gets to the annoying nugget and writes a piece around it and can’t be argued with  Or is it the guy who refers to Tory politicians as troughing scum and goes on expletive-littered rants on Twitter  This guy was very helpful, this guy really wasn’t.”In response, Mr Campbell said: “All we did was occasionally call each other some names on Twitter. The idea that Scottish people are shocked by a few swear-words is laughable.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"here s why scotland is in sights of putin s russia andrew foxall and james rogers","story":"As Vladimir Putin turns his eye on Scotland, the SNP has been visiting states in the Baltic and where to find out how they respond to the Kremlin#s meddling, write Andrew Foxall and James Rogers.Scotland is in the Kremlin’s sights. Since Vladimir Putin ed to the Kremlin in , he has set Russia on a collision course with the West. He wants to weaken the Atlantic alliance, to ide Nato, and to undermine the European Union. He is particularly interested in small European states, whether established or aspirant, and sees them as weak links in the Euro-Atlantic community, vulnerable to Russia’s malign influence.Putin believes the post-Cold War international order is unfair. This idea is not new or his alone, but it has assumed heightened importance as Russia’s oil-fuelled economic growth rates of the early s have been replaced by recession and stagnation. No longer able to generate domestic legitimacy through what he does at home, Putin has sought to generate it through what he does abroad. This is why Scotland matters to Russia.Russia’s interest in Scotland is derived, in part, from its geostrategic location. As the location of the British nuclear base in Faslane, Scotland houses the submarines that still provide much of Nato Europe’s nuclear umbrella. In addition, the waters off Scotland’s north-west coast form part of the Greenland-Iceland-UKGap, the principal choke point between Russia’s Northern Fleet in the Arctic and its strategic interests in the North Atlantic.: Russia’s aggression should worry all who believe in democracy – Stewart McDonald MPDuring the Cold War, the GIUK Gap was probably the most carefully observed stretch of ocean on the planet, but its international importance fell dramatically after the Soviet Union collapsed. Now, as Russia has become more assertive, its prominence has ed and the UK is scrabbling to recover its capabilities there. At the same time, the Kremlin’s interest in Trident never went away.Only this month a Russian naval vessel entered the Moray Firth, forcing the Royal Navy to deploy a warship to monitor its movements. Again and again, Russian aircraft have come close to Scottish air space, forcing RAF Typhoons to scramble from Lossiemouth to mark their presence and escort them away.But the Kremlin’s interest in Scotland is not simply military, rather it is more insidious. In the Scottish nationalist movement, Russia sees a proxy to weaken and ide the UK, which has long been a thorn in the Kremlin’s side. Britain has been a leading advocate for standing firm against Russia’s aggressions from Syria to Ukraine. Provoking tensions within the UK would weaken the country politically, strategically, and militarily, reducing London’s ability to frustrate Russia’s international ambitions.The Kremlin has already developed a sophisticated and well-coordinated arsenal of techniques to ide and dominate small European countries, including: the targeted use of corruption electoral interference use of social media to affect public opinion cyber-attacks and, covert information operations. There are signs that some of these have been rolled out in Scotland.: SNP defence policy to close ‘open door’ to RussiaIn , Edinburgh University established a Russian study centre, funded by the Russkiy Mir Foundation. The Foundation was created by Putin in , is funded from Russia’s federal budget, and aims to both challenge Western views and promote Russia’s position on global issues. Four years later, Russia sent a delegation of pro-Kremlin electoral observers to monitor Scotland’s independence referendum. The lead observer, Igor Borisov, concluded that the vote “[did] not conform to generally accepted international principles of referendums”. This was quickly repeated in a Facebook group called “Rally for a Revote”, which was linked to a petition that collected over , signatures and was heavily promoted by pro-Russian Twitter accounts.In , Sputnik, a mouthpiece of the Kremlin, established its UK headquarters in Edinburgh. The following year, Alex Salmond, the former First Minister of Scotland, was given his own show on RT, the Russian government’s propaganda channel. Last year, meanwhile, Scottish Limited Partnerships were implicated in the so-called Russian Laundromat scandal, a vast money laundering scheme in which up to £ billion of illicit funds were funnelled out of Russia in the early s.No surprises then, that London has started to take Russia’s interests in Scotland seriously. The UK now views Russia as a “tier one” national security threat, just as it viewed the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It has adopted a ‘Fusion Doctrine’ to counter Russia’s hybrid warfare, and is investing in nine P- Poseidon aircraft, in order to monitor activity across the North Atlantic, which will be housed at RAF Lossiemouth.So too has Edinburgh. Members of the Scottish National Party are engaging with their counterparts in allied countries where in Europe, not least in the Baltic, to learn how small states can respond to Russia’s meddling – particularly under Nato’s umbrella.But there is a strange irony, here. The SNP foresees an independent Scotland’s admission to Nato at the same time that it opposes the hosting of British nuclear submarines in Scottish waters. Yet, it is precisely these submarines that provide Nato’s nuclear deterrence in Europe. This would lay down a curious marker: the dominant party in an independent Scotland would jeopardise Nato at the same time that it sought its protection.Worse, it would jeopardise the security of other small states – from Estonia to Iceland – that also depend on Nato.Dr Andrew Foxall is director of the Russia and Eurasia Studies Centre and James Rogers is director of the Global Britain Programme, both at the Henry Jackson Society, an international affairs think tank©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"was feminism just a myth edinburgh starting to feel like it susan dalgety","story":"In the s, strong women helped put Edinburgh in the vanguard of civic le in Scotland, but the city council seems increasingly male dominated, writes Susan Dalgety.Sometimes it is hard to shake off the feeling that we are facing the end of days.Watching New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s strained, but authoritative, appearance in the immediate aftermath of the mosque massacres was a terrible testimony to the inhumanity of terrorism. Her heart was clearly breaking as she realised her country would never be the same again.“We have never seen anything like this, this level of hate and depravity,” said local journalist Kurt Bayer, as he struggled to report the unreportable.Here at home, we are not witnessing carnage, but, night after night, we have been forced to watch the grotesque chaos of our leaders trying, and failing, to run the country.Commentators and historians have run out of words to describe how badly Theresa May has, so far, failed in her efforts to get to the first stage of Brexit. But she is not alone in her gross incompetence. The so-called leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, offers no hope to those of us – half the population – who dread leaving the EU. The Prime Minister may have no discernible leadership qualities, but Corbyn has even fewer.And a quick glance across the Atlantic reminds us all that the leader of the free world is a buffoon, most likely in hock to the Russians, and most definitely a danger to democracy.Earlier this week he, chillingly, appeared to promise armed insurrectionhis authority was threatened in any way. He told the right-wing website Breitbart News, “I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of Bikers for Trump ... I have tough people, but they don’t play tough until they go to a certain point and then it would be very, very bad.”His threat of a military coup, because that is what his words mean, went almost unnoticed, even on Twitter, in part because the notion is so ridiculous. But wait, only three years ago the prospect of a reality TV star and self-confessed sex-abuser becoming leader of the free world was laughed off as impossible. Donald J Trump has now been in office for  days and counting.Little wonder that as the world we used to know falls apart, we turn inwards, to familiar faces and the comfort of our own hometown.: Think society’s not sexist  Crash-test dummies tell dferent story – Susan DalgetyI love Edinburgh. I love it so much that I once spent seven years hard labour as a city councillor. I was not brilliant, nor was I particularly terrible. I learned how hard it is to govern, forced to make spending cuts to things that really matterto save things that mattered even more, such as social care and school dinners.I helped some families, whose terrible circumstances sometimes made me cry. I was proud to serve on the women’s committee that introduced Scotland’s first domestic abuse campaign, Zero Tolerance, and to deliver a commission on social justice.In the s, Edinburgh City Council felt at the vanguard of civic le in Scotland, not least because of the number of high-profile, progressive women, like Lesley Hinds and Margaret McGregor, who were breaking new political ground. The sisters were doing it for their city.Fast forward to , and it is asthe last two decades were a feminist myth. Next month there will be a by-election in the Leith Walk ward, following the resignation of Councillor Marion Donaldson.There are  candidates, including two independents. Nine political parties, from UKIP to the Socialist Labour Party, are contesting the seat. Democracy, it seems, is alive and well down Leith Walk, but only up to a point, because of those  candidates, only one is a woman. One.Let that number sink in. One woman. I was so taken aback by this that I checked out the sex of the  councillors running our capital city.There are currently  male councillors and  women. After the Leith Walk by-election, unless by some miracle the Green Party candidate, the sole woman, wins, there will be  men. Nearly two thirds –  per cent – of the people who run Edinburgh are men.: Susan Dalgety: Michelle of the thigh-high golden boots gets my voteI delved further. The Corporate Policy and Strategy Committee, where the forward planning on issues such as transport, social care and education takes place, has  councillors sitting round the table making the decisions that will affect the lives of nearly half a million people, half of them female. And, yes, you’ve guessed it, only two are women.Now those of you who have read my column before will know that I am always banging on about women, or lack of them, in our public le, in government and in business. I sometimes bore even myself with the torrent of numbers that prove my point that women are still badly under-represented where it matters.But I am not alone in my distress. A few days ago, the Equality and Human Rights Commissionreminded us that only  per cent of Scottish councillors are women, compared to  per cent of the population.Their study also found that political parties who, after all, make the decisions about who should represent them at elections, routinely failed to collect data about the number of women members and candidates, which suggests that they really don’t care about gender balance.However, Dr Lesley Sawers, the EHRC Scotland Commissioner, does. “The ersity of elected local politicians is clearly important, with key decisions undertaken at local government level,” she said on launching the report.“Local politicians also form a crucial part of the pool of potential candidates for selection at other levels of government, including Holyrood and Westminster,” she added.And surely even the most blokeish among you cannot argue with her when she warns that unless we improve “ersity among elected officials at the local level, it may be more dficult to make progress across elected politics”.After a week that has seen people gunned down as they pray, careless politicians gamble our economic security for their personal advancement and the American President threaten his people with tanks on their sidewalks, it may seem parochial, pointless even, to focus on pavement politics.But it matters just as much who decides how much we spend each year on looking after our elderly as it does who has his, or her, finger on the nuclear button.The next council elections are on Thursday  May . That gives the women of Scotland three years to get ready.

I value all public sector workers and I thank them for the work that they do.“On the police pay award - that is the best award for police officers anywhere in the UK and the Scottish Police Federation said it was the best award in  years.”She added: “If the member thinks . per cent is not good enough... then I wonder what he makes of the two per cent that has been awarded to police officers in England by his Tory colleagues in the Westminster government, I think described by the head of the Met as a punch in the nose for police officers ”Later, Mr Simpson said the First Minister should apologise for her remarks in Holyrood.He said: “Nicola Sturgeon should be taking the concerns of a serving police officer extremely seriously. Instead, in front of Scotland’s parliament, she branded him a disgrace.“It’s no wonder officers are losing faith in this SNP government with that kind of attitude. These brave and hardworking police officers should not be discriminated against because they don’t threaten to go on strike.“The First Minister needs to apologise for being so dismissive of his concerns.”In the letter, the anonymous officer said: “Why has such a massive importance been placed on the pay rise for school teachers when other public service staff are not being awarded nearly as much as a pay rise “Does the Scottish Government place the value of police officers as only half that of school teachers  Is it that the Government know that because police officers cannot strike or take any real industrial action that they are an easy target ”A spokesman for the First Minister later said that she would not apologise as her \"disgraceful\" comment was not directed at the police officer but at Graham Simpson.During First Ministers Questions, Mr Simpson was booed by SNP backbenchers as he read out the letter, and asked what Nicola Sturgeon would say to the officer and “thousands of others” like him.Ms Sturgeon went on to say: “In terms of our NHS workers many get higher pay in Scotland than they do in England because of the value we attach to the work that they do.“In terms of teachers they have now been offered an exceptionally good pay deal and I think that is recognition of the good work that they do and I hope that is now accepted.“But I value all public sector workers and I thinkyou look at any group of public sector workers you will find that the value attached to them by the Scottish Government is much much greater than the value attached to their counterparts in England by the Tory government at Westminster.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mile treasure trove of mary queen of scots documents found","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A treasure trove of documents signed by Mary Queen of Scots and revealing the #everyday reality of ruling the country# in the th century has been unearthed in a council storage facility on the Royal Mile.A haul of handwritten papers is said to show the doomed monarch “carefully managing the busy commercial le of Edinburgh”, as well as authorising the building of new defences for the city in Leith.The documents, which are set to be the centrepiece of a new exhibition in Edinburgh on Mary’s short-lived rule, have already been conserved and digitised to allow them to be viewed publicly on the council’s online archive. They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland.

Over the last few weeks KPL staff have been busy ferrying equipment, supplies and crews out to it as part of the first such contract secured by the yard. During a visit, I expected to find a hive of activity the roar and clang of big machines.But on Thursday of last week I found the whole site surprisingly quiet. This, I am told, is because most of the activity is now taking place onboard what KPL directors refer to as the OGW.“The rig is crawling with insurance people and regulators right now,” says one of the directors, Simon Russell, as he shows me round. “They are all signing off their bits and pieces before the rig gets the final piece of paper that says it’s good to go.”Every weld is being stress tested. Every item of equipment is being put through its paces.Before the rig can face the punishing swells of the north Atlantic, such attention to detail is a matter of le and death.There are also inquisitive guests onboard, doing a little window shopping. They’ve been helicoptered straight on to the rig, the property of US firm Diamond Offshore. These VIPs are potential customers from major players such as Tarka Oil, here to see what the buzz is all about. While doing so, they may also be mightily impressed with Kishorn Port Ltd. That is the hope, anyway.As you are reading this, there is a good chance the Ocean GreatWhite, with a crew of  aboard, will be making its way back up the Minch. If the weather is favourable it may even be doing so under its own steam, without the need for a fleet of tugs to tow it to the Blackrock prospect, some  miles north west of Shetland.So advanced is the OGW that each corner-leg contains two enormous thrusters, powered by engines capable of generating , brake horse power of thrust. For non-petrol-heads that’s  Ferraris per engine. A top speed of eight knots is the result. Not bad for a structure that isn’t exactly designed to cut through the water. Stability is the name of game: even in the roughest seas the thrusters are meant to ensure that the rig doesn’t deviate by more than a metre from the drill point. West of Shetland, it may need every Newton of force those thrusters can provide. Once safely in place, the Ocean GreatWhite will be used by Siccar Point Energy and Shell UK to test for oil in an unexplored area of the seabed.“This is really cutting edge stuff,” enthuses Alasdair Ferguson, the other director in this   venture involving his own firm, Ferguson Transport and Shipping, and Simon’s LeithsLtd. “The rig can operate in , feet of water and drill a hole , feet deep.”In other words, that’s six miles into the earth’s crust. This is how far down we now have to go to get the black stuff. As the ‘Age of Oil’ wanes, rigs like the OGW could become the workhorses of the near future.However, the days of building giant concrete caissons to support them are long gone. Whatever finished products emerge from Kishorn in the next few years, another Ninian Central will not be among them. Deep water is where the action is – and that means floating oil rigs like the Ocean GreatWhite, a sixth-generation model designed specically to harvest the hard-to-reach hydrocarbons that now makes up much of what the UK still produces. Thankfully for Kishorn, that means west of Shetland.  According to Simon, this trend involves the “centre of gravity” shting away from Aberdeen and towards the west coast.KPL is ready and waiting for that trend to continue.“The same thing is happening with offshore wind,” says Simon. “If you look at the next round of Crown licenses you’ll see that most of them are here on the west coast.”“We want to create a multi-use facility,” adds Alasdair. “We want to build resilience into this facility so that it is not reliant on any one industry.”Offshore wind turbines need concrete caissons, albeit smaller than the Ninian Central’s. That’s another box ticked in favour of Kishorn.From about  metres away, the Ocean GreatWhite does indeed look like a floating hotel, to use Simon’s description. Unfortunately, this is as close as we are allowed to get. Obtaining insurance cover for non-crew is a minefield Diamond Offshore also doesn’t want any photographs taken of their cutting-edge equipment. So circling the rig aboard the ‘Infinity’ will have to do for us.Aside from ferrying crew to and from the Ocean GreatWhite, the ‘Infinity’ usually takes tourists out to St Kilda from the Stein jetty in Waternish. But that happens mostly in the summer.“We have been flat out doing this since the rig arrived,” says skipper Kenny Mackinnon.Regular work over the winter is good for those who don’t usually have it.In fact, the arrival of the OGW has been a boon for the area. Twelve locals have been taken on in ious positions. This is the direct benefit. There is a harder to quanty knock-on effect for local businesses in what Alasdair refers to as the “downstream supply chain”. Everything from additional bed nights to sandwiches bought in the nearest shops are covered by this concept. And there have been quite a few of those over the last six weeks.Food and lodgings for visiting crews and subcontracted workers might sound like small beer, however. But the temporary largesse created by the presence of the OGW could be the start of something much bigger.Nothing like the crazy days of the s and s, though, when a town of , people sprung up in accommodation blocks behind the dry dock. That kind of development, said Simon, will not happen again, partly because of the strain it would place on local infrastructure.  Instead, he envisions - people employed directly at the site.The prefabs of Kishorn’s heyday are long gone but the dry dock is still here, its original concrete floor as good as new, so I’m told. The faint imprint of the Ninian Central , once the biggest manmade object ever moved across the face of the Earth, is still visible a spectral impression of the past.KPL have more modest ambitions than trying to resurrect what was.Simon and Alasdair are building in small steps. They’re making progress, just at a slower pace than many would like to see.Further investment is required to speed things up. That, however, is based partly on more rigs using the yard. KPL have a few irons in the fire on that front, but nothing definite yet.“The revenue this will generate will enable us to extend one of the piers, out into the deeper water, so we can load and unload directly rather than having to ferry equipment and people back and forth,” says Alasdair.Just sixty metres from the shore Loch Kishorn reaches a depth of around  metres, easily enough to accommodate oil rigs which, it should be remembered, need taken apart when they’ve reached the end of their working lives. Decommissioning s is on the KPL menu too.If , jobs were a flash in the pan,  jobs might be the sustainable optimum. By definition, the slow build lasts longer than the quick buck.In this place of big numbers,  might be big enough."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"highland council to engage in keep left campaign through two year","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Highland Council is to engage in a two-year programme of painting directional arrows on roads to remind tourists to drive on the left.During a recent area committee meeting in Portree, Gordon MacDonald, Highland Council#s roads manager, told local councillors that the scheme would begin in April .

Again, band members lined the Diamond Road at Skeogh Orange Hall when the hearse carrying Mr Carey’s remains stopped briefly as a mark of respect on the way to First Dromore Presbyterian Church, where Ted was to be buried after the funeral service.Drum Major Colin Ward led a bearer-party into the church with Mr Carey’s coffin, the honour guard lining the church steps as Gordon Jamison played a hymn on the flute.Ted Carey had joined the ranks ofSkeogh Flute Band in , when he was just eight years old.

It honours the UK’s solemn commitments in the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.“If we ever have to use that insurance policy, it cannot become a permanent arrangement and it is not a template for our future relationship.“The deal that MPs voted on in January was not strong enough in making that clear and legally-binding changes were needed to set that right. We have now agreed them.“The EU cannot act with the intent of applying the backstop indefinitely which can be challenged.“Now it is time to come together and back this improved deal.” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the new agreements were an “unambiguous statement” of both sides’ “good faith and intentions” but also made it clear they did not undermine the principle of the backstop.“We have insisted that the Withdrawal Agreement could not be rewritten, and that the backstop arrangement, while intended to be temporary, must continue to apply unless and until it is replaced by future arrangements that can achieve the same objective, namely no hard border,” he said.“However, we have also said that we were prepared to offer guarantees and further reassurances and to the UK of our good faith and intentions – indeed we have offered such reassurances on many occasions.“The Instrument agreed yesterday puts those assurances on a legal footing and represents an unambiguous statement by both parties of what has been agreed. “It does not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, or undermine the backstop or its application. “It says that we will work together, in good faith, in pursuit of a future relationship that ensures that the objectives of the Protocol, particularly the need to avoid a hard border, are met. “The documents agreed yesterday reiterate our wish to establish a future partnership with the UK that is as close as possible, and marks our commitment to ensure that negotiations on that future relationship can begin as soon as the UK leaves. “The instrument agreed sets out how we will go about this important work. “In many ways, Brexit has been a dark cloud over us for many months, and particularly the threat of no deal. A positive vote tonight can remove that cloud and restore confidence and optimism in Britain, Ireland and across the European Union. “We now need to see the Withdrawal Agreement ratied by Westminster and by the European Parliament without further delay, so that we can get on with the important work of building the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, and between the UK and Ireland, post Brexit. “I know feel that for the remains of the day, we need to give MPs in Westminster the time and space to consider what#s now on the table.” All eyes now turn to UK Attorney General Geoffrey Cox who will later today give his considered assessment of whether what Mrs May has secured is legally binding. His response is expected to be key in deciding what way Brexit hardliners – notably Jacob Rees-Mogg’s ERG and the DUP – will vote this evening.

But now, it seems the only paths are to see a catastrophic no deal outcome, the Government working across the House of Commons to find a softer version of Brexit, or reconsidering Brexit in its entirety,# she said.“In the short run, taking a no deal off the table must be the immediate priority. In itself and without a clear plan, this resolves nothing. The House of Commons is good at saying what it is against, but can’t manage to give a clear answer on what it is for. But the UK is too close to the clf-edge and every day of uncertainty sees more and more economic and social damage.“The clearest, most coherent and most democratic route through this impasse lies with a People’s Vote, including both the Prime Minister’s deal and the Remain option. This needs to be tested in Parliament as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sentence overturned for man carrying flag","story":"AN IRSP activist who was convicted for carrying a flag during a Falls Road Easter commemoration has had his sentence overturned.In December last year, West Belfast man Sean Carlin was given a four-month suspended sentence for carrying a historical replica of an INLA Belfast Battalion flag during the commemoration in .The parade had been themed to honour local members who had lost their lives during attacks on the organisation following a  split. However, in what is believed to be the first case of its kind, Sean was subsequently arrested and convicted under the Terrorism Act  for carrying the flag in circumstances that state authorities deemed to arouse suspicion that he is a member or supporter of a proscribed organisation.This week, Sean revealed that his suspended sentence had been quashed with a £ fine issued in its stead following a court appeal against the earlier ruling.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sean said: “From the start of this I was of the opinion that no matter what the outcome of the case was that I was going to be fighting it. If I was convicted, and eventually was convicted, then the benchmark was set and would have big repercussions for republicans right across the board. The point we made was that this was a commemorative event. It was advertised as a commemorative event so we were trying to unravel the agenda of the PPS and the cops.“We’ve been of the opinion that, this is all because we didn’t buy into the Fresh Start Agreement,” he added.“The IRSP has been getting hounded since then. This flag issue was just another signicant push in relation to criminalising the IRSP. On a personal level, I couldn’t accept carrying a flag to commemorate your dead being a criminal offence – it’s unheard of.”Sean’s solicitor, Michael Brentnall, said that while the case has “set the benchmark” in terms of sentencing, the legislation surrounding the conviction stands to be challenged.“I think it’s signicant, particularly the judges remarks at the end, who stated that no person in Ireland should go to jail for carrying a flag in Ireland. That’s signicant in itself and it has set the benchmark for how these matters be dealt with. We’re now seeking senior council’s opinion on whether there is a point of law that can be taken to the court of appeal on the basis of the conviction alone rather than just the sentence.” He continued: “Each case is facts specic, but in Sean’s case it was said during proceedings that every case of somebody carrying a similar flag to a commemoration could be criminalised. Sean was the only person this had been enforced against – there’s an issue with that in itself, but then Sean’s barrister made the point that this was a clear breach of freedom of expression and the sanction was entirely excessive in relation to the context of what had happened.”He added: “Another point that we still have to explore is that the legislation is very vague. The legislation says that you can be a supporter or a member of a proscribed organisation. If this is a means of circumventing membership charges and having somebody landed with a charge then that’s a dferent fight.”"},{"url":null,"title":"artistic harry 8 scores winners medal from his","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Having such high-tech equipment available locally would mean many people from the area would not have to travel long distances to have their tests carried out where, Mr McGrath continued.ldquoSuch a scan can be a worrying time and the fact that people have to travel to other places for the scan adds to the anxiety.Cllr Trainor said a mobile scanner currently in place at the Downe to ease pressure at the Ulster Hospital will only be there for a few more weeks.ldquoDoes this fact not make the business case for the local health trust, too many people using the current scanner at the Ulster so one is required at the Downe  he asked.ldquoI hope local health officials will hurry up with their administrative work required to progress the business case to provide an MRI scanner in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"City deals could bring finanacial boost for Newcastle  ","story":"PLANS to deliver a signicant multi-million pound tourism bonanza in Newcastle have taken an important step forward this week.Highly ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in the resort are among the key projects included in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector which have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.On Monday, members of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee agreed to sign a heads of agreement deal which paves the way for work to start on outline business cases and financial plans for ious components of the city deal which includes the Mournes Gateway project.Local authority officials are expected to work with Tourism NI to help deliver the ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle which include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes.The proposal is one of a series of exciting, world class attraction proposals, including an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It is being suggested that work on the business case and financial plans could take around one year to complete, with the ious proposals delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.And while the main focus is on the major aspects of the tourism initiative mdash which also include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy and an indoor activity centre in Donard Park mdash there are many other components.The Newcastle tourism project was a key part of the city deal which has secured a near poundbn investment package from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.Newry, Mourne and Down is hoping to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.And while talks continue to secure cash under the city deal initiative, local council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for its other aspects and move the ious projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.The tourism schemersquos other proposals include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision. There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes.A so-called lsquogreen travel networkrsquo which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.The ious proposals form the core of the so-called Mourne Mountains Gateway Study and have already been discussed with the National Trust, Forest Service and Environment Agency.Before anything happens, numerous planning and environmental approvals will be required, alongside the compilation of feasibility studies and business cases.The overarching vision of the gateway project is to provide game-changing, world-class, international tourist attractions which develop sustainable enhancement of access from Newcastle to the Mournes and its foothills and forests, while also broadening recreational provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Coney Island singer Jayne looking for support to produce new album  ","story":"FROM Coney Island, to Nashville and on to Vancouver, musician Jayne Trimble has travelled many miles to get to where she is today.The folk musician is heading to Los Angeles next month to record her third album mdash that isshe can raise at least , Canadian dollars mdash thatrsquos pound, mdash to cover initial production costs.The former Down High student is asking local people, and women in particular, to support her Kickstarter campaign to record the album Your Mother Was A Peacock.While Jaynersquos vocals are hauntingly soft, she describes her latest music as ldquovisceral and epic.She is recording the new album, which will be produced by Damien Jurado, under the name Oxlip mdash which is an Irish wildflower.ldquoItrsquos my most ambitious and exciting album to date, explained the  year-old. ldquoItrsquos a collection of songs based on the lives of women throughout history who have either been scapegoated, or were just plain tragic.

There is also concern about the surface of the existing car park which is particularly uneven and the absence of adequate parking for visitors with young families.The access from the car park to the beach for families pushing prams is described as ldquounsuitable with the financial spend approved at Mondayrsquos meeting designed to improve the overall visitor experience, create a better first impression, improve the car park surface and the number of available spaces.New directional signs are also proposed, with council officials warning failure to address the issues could result in the loss of blue flag status, result in a negative visitor experience, reduced visitor numbers and income.To progress the improvement work, council officials have agreed to appoint a contractor to design a scheme.The planned investment has been welcomed by Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran.He said he was pleased local authority officials have recognise the need to improve Tyrella to ensure it continues to attract a high number of visitors, particularly from April and September.ldquoTyrella is an extremely popular beach, he said. ldquoIt is highly regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos top beaches and it is vital it retains its blue flag status. We rely heavily upon tourism in our area and we need to ensure our beaches are up to standard.Cllr Curran says he has no doubt that investing in Tyrella is not only ldquogood news for the district and visitors to the area, but will produce an economic idend through increased use.He continued: ldquoWe are fortunate to have stunning beaches like Tyrella, Kilclief and Ballyhornan on our doorstep. Those who work to keep our bathing waters clean and, more importantly, up to an internationally recognised standard so they are safe to use, do a terric job.Cllr Curran said picturesque beaches helped make up the ldquounique fabric of Lecale and the surrounding area and were a vital tourism resource.He added: ldquoThe planned investment at Tyrella is a good news story and I am pleased that the local authority is not content to sit back on its laurels but recognises the importance of continuing investment in a wealth of tourism assets right across the entire district.ldquoDown District is lucky to be blessed with such priceless resources which can make a valuable contribution to the health and well-being of our local communities and visitors alike. It is essential that we continue to strive for the very highest of standards across all our facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Derry Girls fun in Ballyhornan  ","story":"THE hit comedy series Derry Girls is putting Ballyhornan on the map.The Wee Shop in the small coastal village will be featured in one of the upcoming storylines of the much-anticipated second series.Viewers will see Game of Thrones actor Ian McElhinney and comedian Tommy Tiernan as Granda Joe and Da Gerry go off on some undisclosed caper in Burt, Co Donegal.Part of the newsagentrsquos shop and cafe was transformed into a grungy taxi office for two days of filming which took place at the end of last October.The Cable Bar, which is just feet away from the shop, is also featured in the scene.With old petrol pumps outside the shop, vintage tractors and an ice-cone sign, the Wee Shop looked authentic for the filming and should spark nostalgia for viewers of Donegal holidays for years past.The five young teens which star in the surprise Netflix hit set in s Derry mdash actors Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee OrsquoDonnell, Dylan Llewellyn and Louisa Harland mdash were not involved in the filming.Channel rsquos Derry Girls, written by Lisa McGee, attracted an average two million audience per episode for its first series last year. Its inclusion on Netflix last December has now made it into a global success.Brendan Magennis, owner of The Wee Store, has retained the show set as faithfully as he could post-filming and hopes that it will help put Ballyhornan on the tourist trail mdash just as Game of Thrones did for Castleward.ldquoI donrsquot know when the programme will be broadcast but I know that The Wee Shop as the Roscarna Cars taxi office will be featured in a seven-and-a-half minute scene in this series, he said.ldquoEverybody from Ballyhornan will be glued to their sets to see the shop and Ballyhornan in the programme.

No one thought this was going to happen.Mrs Trainor believes the Downe is capable of accommodating both ENT day surgery and the proposed cataract service, given that it is relatively modern hospital, boasting a range of high tech, diagnostic equipment and theatres.She added: ldquoIt simply beggars belief that we are to lose a key day surgery for people with ear, nose and throat problems. The loss is compounded by the fact that local hospital campaigners were not informed this was happening or asked for their views.Last week, a South Eastern Trust spokeswoman confirmed there were no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Farmers opposed to geopark plans  ","story":"PLANS to secure world renowned tourism branding for an area stretching from Strangford Lough to South Armagh have been dealt a major blow this week.As Newry, Mourne and Down Council prepares to submit a bid to secure prestigious UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the Ulster Farmersrsquo Union has labelled the proposal a ldquonon starter.Consultants have been working on the councilrsquos bid for geopark status ahead of a formal application being made this November.Supporters of the ambitious plan insist that securing geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geopark branding is one of the key planks of the local authorityrsquos tourism strategy with those involved in the process confident it has the potential to increase the number of international visitors to the area.However, the Ulster Farmersrsquo Union mdash whose representatives met recently with local authority officials and representatives from Geological Survey NI mdash says farmers are ldquounanimously opposed to the geopark.While it has been suggested that securing geopark branding could potentially be worth in the region of poundm for local tourism, the farmersrsquo union says it is ldquofar from impressed at the assertion that the designation will bring increased recreational opportunities and promote social inclusion.UFU deputy president Victor Chestnutt said farmers in the Newry, Mourne and Down area were were ldquofar from impressed with promises made by officials they met recently.The UFU official continued: ldquoI would like to remind these officials that farmers have been the custodians of the land for hundreds of years. Imposing a designation on this area will affect their livelihoods which will have a knock-on effect on all ratepayers in the area.ldquoCouncil officials believe and are promoting that this designation will not restrict the operations of any farmer. This is unrealistic and their approach is disappointing.ldquoWe are % opposed to these plans and I would urge the council to meet our members, listen to their concerns and reconsider their plans to progress with such an application.Mr Chestnutt is encouraging local authority officials to provide figures to UFU members to support claims that geopark branding will help grow farm businesses, confirming that until farmers see the figures in black and white, they will continue to dispute any such claims.The UFU vice-president said with local government elections fastapproaching, the organisation believes the time is right to review any proposed geopark application.He continued: ldquoThe UFU has made contact with each of the parties and all independent councillors who currently hold seats on Newry, Mourne and Down Council and it is disappointing that only a very small number have taken the time to listen and engage with us. We have many members residing and working in the area and some councillors have missed a genuine opportunity to engage with their constituents.The senior union official said the ldquostigma around the Mournes national park debate a number of years ago is still very much at the forefront of farmersrsquo minds, explaining that at the time, UFU members were united in their opposition to the proposals.Mr Chestnutt said the UFU believed that farmers who live and work in the area should decide whether or not an area is suitable for national park or global geopark status.He said the council had put nothing on the table to reassure members and encourage them to reverse their position.With tourism one of the key drivers behind the geopark branding, Mr Chestnutt said Tourism NI was ldquovisibly absent from any discussions.He said farmers believed tourism in the area could be developed without the need to introduce a special designation.ldquoThe funding and resources the council has earmarked for the development and operation of the proposed new geopark should be redirected to the general promotion of tourism and infrastructure development. We are in favour of economic development but securing geopark status is not the way to do it, he declared.Mr Chestnutt added: ldquoOur message is simple and direct ndash farmers in the area are strongly opposed to the geopark proposal and I would urge all councillors, council officials and the Geological Survey of NI to fully and meaningfully engage with us.ldquoThe best course of action would be to rethink the geopark proposal and focus tourism investment into wider promotion of our beautul countryside.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council said the geopark had the potential to make a ldquosignicant contribution to local communities and tourism in the Mourne, Ring of Gullion and Strangford and Lecale areas.ldquoIt is important to understand that a geopark is not a legislative designation and will therefore not place any restrictions on economic activity within the proposed areas, including on any farming practices, he said.ldquoThe introduction of a geopark will not introduce additional planning restrictions and instead will simply provide an globally recognised accreditation.ldquoThe geopark will only include sites which already have public access and the geopark will not promote any access to private land, unless the landowner in question wants to work with the geopark.The spokesman added: ldquoThe process to achieve geopark designation is ongoing and it is not until  that an accreditation would be confirmed as part of this ongoing process.ldquoIn the meantime, the council will continue to deliver events and activities to increase awareness of what the project represents and how it can grow our tourism offering and support our local communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash THE Earl of Clanwilliamrsquos th century mansion and -acre estate at Montalto, Ballynahinch, officially goes on sale today.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before.

The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport.

However, with locations such as Penarth growing from strength to strength there is a shortage of good quality and low cost accommodation to fulfil demand. Therefore we are looking to expand our portfolio in Wales with a further seven hotels, this will boost our presence to .Cllr Jonathan Bird, Cabinet Member for Regeneration and Planning, said: \"This is very exciting news for Penarth.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Then to handler Gerry Cosgrave to get the horse ready for his first point to point race.Thrills abounded when his black and red colours were chosen and on April , , Battleoverdoyen won his first race at Loughanmore with jockey Mark O’Hare.Michael recalls his phone never stopped on the way home and the next day the cream of racing were looking to buy the winner.He decided to go to the prestigious Tattersalls sales in Cheltenham the following week and the horse, was set at a reserve for £,.After a buzzing sales ring it sold to the powerhouse Gigginstown stud, owned by the O’Leary’s of Ryanair fame, for a whopping £,.Michael recalls it wasn’t about the money. He has been a punter all his le and dreamed of owning a superstar.For him it was about seeing a stud which could develop his horse into a future star.Describing Battleoverdoyen’s style, Michael believes it is all in his stride. He recalled the thoroughbred, who is  hands tall, at a point to point. “He was third last and they thought that was it. But that is his style of running.

term for biting officer  ","story":"A woman who bit a female police officer - which required her to be tested for HIV - was given a prison sentence last Wednesday at Craigavon Magistrates Court.And it was only suspended on the basis that the defendant did notto Northern Ireland.Joanne Molloywhose address at the time was Beech Meadows, Waringstown, was charged with two assaults on females occasioning them actual bodily harm.She was also accused of two assaults on police.For each of the offences she was sentenced to four months in prison, suspended for two years. The court heard that on July , , at approximately .pm a male and a female waved down a police mobile patrol in Edward Street in Lurgan.The injured party alleged she had been approached by a female who was aggressive and snatched her mobile phone from her. The attacker then grabbed her by the hair and scratched her.Molloy was stopped by police in High Street and she said: “We done nothing wrong.”In the custody suite she was verbally aggressive and lunged towards an officer.She was swinging her arms and kicked out her legs towards officers and one received a bite on the thumb.When interviewed she said she was drunk and couldn’t remember the circumstances of her arrest.Defence barrister Damien Halloran said his client had been convicted in her absence in Craigavon court after she had absented herself from the jurisdiction.He added that at Ennis court she had been put on probation for an assault but there was nothing outstanding since July .\"  \"  PSNI urge people to report ‘graphic and deeply disturbing’ video of NZ massacre Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"“She accepts that her behaviour in Lurgan was outrageous,” added Mr Halloran. “She hasn’t had a drink in five and a half years or any illegal substances.”He explained that she had come to this jurisdiction with a partner, there was domestic violence involved and she ended the relationship.Mr Halloran handed in a number of testimonials on her behalf and added that she was now working as a dental nurse.“This lady has completely turned her le around,” he added.He said she had challenged extradition proceedings but this was not successful and she had been in custody since Monday.Mr Halloran said her father had died and his funeral was on Thursday so all she wanted was to get back to bury her father and look after her children.He asked the court to consider leaving something hanging over the defendant.District Judge, Mrs Bernie Kelly, said that in the middle of all this Molloy had not given any thought to the permanency of the injury inflicted on one of the officers due to her ‘drink and drug fuelled’ state.She added that the female officer she bit had to be HIV tested which meant she had to declare that to any insurance company evenit came back negative.Mr Halloran said there was a relative of the defendant in court and £ was available.Imposing the suspended sentence Judge Kelly told Molloy this was on the basis that she would never darken the six counties in her le.She added that she could not ask for compensation for the officer because she was thinking in terms of thousands.try catch  TrendingTullygally shops reopen as searches in Craigavon continueEmergency closure of Co Armagh road in high windsTwo vehicle

He was also fined £ for not having a test certicate.The court heard that at approximately .pm he was stopped on the Northway and checks showed there was no insurance or test certicate for the vehicle. The insurance had lapsed because of lack of payment and the MOT had expired. Carceres made full admissions and the vehicle was seized.The case had been adjourned from a previous court to get a pre-sentence report.A solicitor representing the defendant said he had been disqualied from driving for a year on December . He added that there had been a number of no insurances close together.District Judge, Mrs Bernie Kelly, said Carceres said hasn’t got how serious a predicament he was in because he said that he could not do community service because on that day he saw his daughter or may have a bit of overtime.“Over a period of four months three times he was detected with no insurance,” she added. “Even today he doesn’t realise he could go to prison.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20190201_0983.jpg","title":"pwc investing in people purpose and belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business Almost  years after it moved  staff and , paper files into Waterfront Plaza, PwC will move again – this time taking around , people and some very smart technology to Merchant Square in the heart of Belfast Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business locally.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC.
