and some staff could now join Sports Direct          The House of Fraser websites was down today but the company says it is honouring existing orders      After a quiet transfer window fans of Mike Ashley\u0027s Newcastle United joked House of Fraser was a new player. Record goalscorer Alan Shearer posted a link the the business news and said: \u0027What position does he play?\u0027Mr Ashley previously promised manager Rafael Benitez \u0027every penny generated\u0027 by the club to spend on transfers, but the Magpies ended the window with an estimated net profit of more than £15million.Their most expensive signing this summer was Yoshinori Muto from German side FSV Mainz 05 for an estimated £9.5million. In response to the news of the buyout of House of Fraser, Shearer\u0027s former Newcastle teammate, Steve Howey, tweeted: \u0027After my rant yesterday on the BBC about where has the money gone and no one could answer... now we know.\u0027One Newcastle fan tweeted: \u0027Mike Ashley buying a crumbling high street retailer for £90million amidst protests about where our 100million in TV money that was promised to Rafa has gone, the day after the transfer window closes, says it all.\u0027                                                     Pint-drinking billionaire nicknamed The Chav King of the High Street whose Sports Direct empire started with a single sports shop and a £10,000 loan          Close: Mike Ashley and his ex-wife Linda have rekindled their relationship 12 years after their orceFormer squash coach Mike Ashley started his business career in a Maidenhead sports shop and went on to become one of Britain\u0027s richest men.No doubt he is a ruthless and successful businessman but he has often appeared more comfortable with a pint in his hand at the football than in a suit on business and is a self-confessed \u0027power drinker\u0027.An extraordinary court case last year heard Mr Ashley vomited in a pub fireplace at a company meeting after downing 12 pints of lager during a drinking competition with a colleague, a court has heard.The Newcastle United owner allegedly held senior management meetings which turned into \u0027pub lock-ins\u0027 involving flowing alcohol, kebabs and drinking games, a judge was told.He would also lie under tables and \u0027take a nap\u0027 at meetings he found boring, it was alleged.Billionaire Mr Ashley is from a humble background and has developed a reputation for frugality.Even when he was on his path to making his millions he preferred to drive around in a clapped-out Vauxhall Cavalier while his glamourous Swedish wife Linda had a Aston Martin DB4.But this didn\u0027t last forever because Mr Ashley traded it in for a new Ford Sierra a few years later.Mr Ashley\u0027s 33-room pillared mansion in London\u0027s Beverly Hills in Barnet has a sweeping drive, four garages and its near-neighbours are said to include Arsene Wenger and several members of One Direction.It is a world away from when he started Sports Direct 34 years ago with a £10,000 loan from his parents.He built it up from a single shop in Maidenhead, Berkshire, into one of the nation\u0027s most successful retailers and holds a 55 per cent stake in the company, currently valued at around £1.4 billion.Never mind that most of the tracksuits and training shoes he sells are worn by unsporty couch-potatoes rather than gym bunnies, or that the rough-diamond entrepreneur has been nicknamed The Chav King of the High Street.      The sale of House of Fraser to Mike Ashley has once again seen a billionaire and bankers allowed to cash in on the collapse of a failing company while ordinary savers pay the priceThese were employees who spent their lives toiling at the counters and on the shop floors to keep the business afloat.Their savings are now being dumped into the lifeboat Pension Protection Fund, where they’re likely to see their retirement incomes chopped by 10 per cent.The bankers, in whose hands the future of House of Fraser was left, rejected a bid for the solvent company from retail tycoon Philip Day, probably because it would have left savers ahead of them in the list of creditors, leaving them unable to take their pound of flesh.This is a deep flaw in company law that puts workers and the firm’s obligations below the needs of bankers.The Pension Protection Fund, which is funded by a levy on savers, should be a last resort for when companies go completely under.But it is being abused and used as a safety net for opportunistic billionaires hoping to snap up the assets of a struggling firm.If they want the assets, the pensions should be part of the package.Like a phoenix rising from the ashes of the old burned out business, Mr Ashley has promised to turn House of Fraser into the Harrods of the High Street.In the process though he’s burned the very workers who helped to keep it alive.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/10/18/4EFF21D400000578-6047229-image-a-81_1533920794729.jpg","title":"Inside New Mexico compound Muslim extremist hiding","story":"    Shovels remain in a hole which was being dug to access the tunnel at the New Mexico compound where 11 starving children and five adults were found on Friday           The tunnel appears to go under the trailer and is surrounded by tires           The back of a moving truck served as sleeping quarters at a squalid makeshift living compound          Various items litter the filthy kitchen at the compound near Amalia in New Mexico          Boxes of ammunition is left behind at a squalid compound          A makeshift toilet and bottles of bleach are seen in this improvised bathroom at the compound          A black gun holster hangs next to a filthy child\u0027s dress in this photo taken on Friday August 10          An exit tunnel is seen at the compound. The family had  begun digging a tunnel into the desert ground          Clothes, a travel pillow and other items lay strewn across a filthy bed          Copies of the Quran are seen on a bale of hay at the compound near Amalia in New Mexico          This is one of the disorganized rooms in a trailer at the New Mexico compound where a Muslim extremist was found with 11 starving children, his wife, two sisters and his brother-in-law last Friday           The family had started digging a tunnel into the desert ground at the site but it is not known what they planned to use it for          The pistols Siraj Wahhaj was allegedly using to teach the children to carry out school shootings with were left behind by police at the compound           It is difficult to grasp the layout of the compound because the rooms or areas where the family spent most of their time are all covered by clear tarp.

Many of the family\u0027s possessions were simply left at the compound by police  Imam Sirah has also claimed that it was him who received the message that the children required food and were starving. \u0027We have been meeting with law enforcement since day one,\u0027 he said, speaking near his Brooklyn mosque on Thursday. The message, he said, was sent by one of his daughters to a man in Georgia who passed it on to him. When he got it, he told the man to find out where to send the food and he gave the address to authorities. \u0027What I do? I said \u0027find out where to send the food. That\u0027s why the police came in, because of information that we gave them,\u0027 he said. His story does not align with the police timeline of events which states that they knew the family was in the compound but could not move in on the site because they were not certain that AG was inside. He described his son as \u0027high strung\u0027 and \u0027strange\u0027 but said he had no knowledge of any form of sinister plot.           The imam\u0027s son, who shares his name, is pictured in court in New Mexico on Wednesday.

Get up close and personal with the extraordinary Moai statues carved between the 12th to 17th centuries, with heads weighing up to 82 tons. You’ll be given a miniature statue as your ‘pillow present’.

I said \u0027find out where to send the food. That\u0027s why the police came in, because of information that we gave them,\u0027 he said. His story does not align with the police timeline of events which states that they knew the family was in the compound but could not move in on the site because they were not certain that AG was inside. He described his son as \u0027high strung\u0027 and \u0027strange\u0027 but said he had no knowledge of any form of sinister plot.           The imam\u0027s son, who shares his name, is pictured in court in New Mexico on Wednesday.

Marriages are far more stable than cohabitation or any kind of unmarriage, and the behaviour of politicians smacks of hypocrisy.‘We need to welcome everybody from all income groups and all classes into marriage, which is a far better basis for the family for adults and for children.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/10/13/4EFCAFFB00000578-0-image-m-23_1533903090883.jpg","title":"Britains five big banks set pay shareholders 12 7bn year","story":"    The top five lenders on the London Stock Exchange will hand out £12.7billion to shareholders this year, in a sign their profits have come roaring back (file photo)House of Fraser tells shoppers they cannot spend gift cards...Share this articleJustin Modray of advice firm Candid Money said: ‘Yet again, banks are choosing to profit at the expense of savers when they could be passing on the rise in the base rate to savers.’Banks’ revenues will automatically rise by hundreds of millions of pounds thanks to the 1.3million customers on a tracker mortgage.Barclays and Lloyds have also increased the interest on their standard variable rate mortgages by 0.25 percentage points but have failed to give savers any increase.The pair made combined profits of £4.8billion in the first six months of 2018. They are both among the top five FTSE 100 lenders, who together made £9.3billion of profits in the second quarter of 2018, their best three-month showing in more than five years.Their total idend pay-out this year will be up on last year’s £10.9billion and will be the highest since the £13.3billion doled out in 2007.           Barclays and Lloyds have also increased the interest on their standard variable rate mortgages by 0.25 percentage points but have failed to give savers any increase (file photo)"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/11/02/4F00AD6000000578-6049425-image-a-28_1533949212058.jpg","title":"GERALD DURRELLS timeless memoir madcap family","story":"    Gerald Durrell (pictured above) was a British naturalist, zookeeper, conservationist, author and television presenter who founded the Durrell Wildlife Conservation TrustFor my brother Leslie, 19, hunched and glowering by the fire, it was his ears, inflamed and bleeding delicately.To my 18-year-old sister Margo the weather had delivered a fresh dappling of acne spots to a face that was already blotched like a red veil. And for my widowed mother Louisa there was a rich, bubbling cold, with a twinge of rheumatism to season it. Only my eldest brother, Larry, then 23, was untouched.He had become increasingly irritable as the days wore on. \u0027Why do we stand this bloody climate?\u0027 he asked suddenly one afternoon, gesturing towards the rain-distorted window. \u0027Look at it!

As the summer rain beat down outside, customers streamed in through its doors to seek shelter, meet friends and family or kill time browsing the shelves and rails.Earlier in the day, it was announced that Sports Direct, the sportswear chain controlled by Mike Ashley, had bought the struggling retailer in a £90m rescue deal.For customers in Guildford who had heard the news, the biggest concerns were whether the retailer would retain its upmarket reputation as well as its 17,000 staff.“It could be interesting days, to see what happens with the man who buys it,” said Cyril Clark, 66. “It’s a sad day to see House of Fraser in the state it’s in, it’s a good store to come to. It’s a very different brand to Sports Direct, and my concern is Mike Ashley will bring Sports Direct into places like this.”Clark’s wife, Julia, 61, added: “It depends what he’s going to do with the brand, whether he’ll keep it as an upmarket store or changes it. “You need the right people working for you in order to create the right environment. If Ashley is not nice to his staff he won’t attract the right staff. And if you have less discerning staff, with less experience, customers might be told incorrect information. You’d expect a store in this place in the market to give a certain level of customer service.”Jonathan Lee, 63, echoed this sentiment: “My immediate thoughts would be if there are redundancies and if people will be asked to take lower pay. “But maybe they can make the brand of House of Fraser continue, and I suppose this situation is the best you can hope for for any of this.”The company’s collapse represents a wider trend whereby high street retailers battle to survive in today’s tough market, saturated by a combination of people shopping more online and wary consumers who have tightened their purse strings.Friends Sylvie Roberts, 75, and Linda Coleman, 72, who were having a catch-up in the store, said they were delighted that House of Fraser was being saved. “We’ve spent all day feeling very sad about the business. I think they have to do whatever they need to do to keep people employed, there’s no other choice. We’ve been shopping here for the past 50 years, buying presents and whatever. They cover everything really and the staff are lovely.”Another shopper, Julie, who declined to give her surname, said: “I think it’s a shame because I can’t remember it not being here. I would be slightly horrified if this place became a Sports Direct. Is Guildford the right place for this? I’ve been a customer for 30 years, I meet friends here for coffee and have a browse. It has all your essentials.”Meanwhile, social media users adopted a more tongue-in-cheek approach to the news.“Get yourself down to House of Fraser, they’re about to start doing Slazenger umbrellas and Donnay socks at half price,” said @MrPaulRobinson on twitter.“Just wait for those glorious House of Fraser giant mugs with every purchase,” said @NickJonHughes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3f7b7a1b11d191ab7ffc64f2bcdb1933764190/0_0_4734_2841/master/4734.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bded5516e88724442a0025cd4498e936","title":"calm amid the concrete britains best urban green spaces","story":"From shopping centre beehives to grand hidden gardens, there’s respite from the madding crowds in Britain’s towns and citiesDalston Eastern Curve Garden, LondonThis leafy lifeline, situated slap bang in the middle of Dalston’s lively chicken shops, boutique bars and technicolor nail salons, is a vital addition to one of London’s most densely populated boroughs, where few people have access to their own garden.

And what might those be, you ask? There’s a heritage orchard, an ornamental garden, an orangery, a rotunda and bastion, for starters. Then you can check out the Corinthian columns and explore an elaborate, shell and fossil-lined grotto, complete with lioness and river god – a perfect spot for your very own Jane Austen moment.

It now features a 9-metre-high Industrial Revolution iron waterwheel, a huge Helping Hand sculpture and lush sub-tropical plants. And zero dog poo.Cambo Gardens, FifeWith winding paths, fast-flowing streams and swarms of butterflies, the walled, wild gardens of Cambo House seem straight out of a storybook.

This summer you’ll find numerous spaces for ideas for creating better societies“Crowds are not fun. Claustrophobia is not fun. I want to go home, have a proper shower, and a poo.” In the forthcoming British film comedy The Festival (made by the team behind The Inbetweeners), the lead character, Nick, isn’t really enjoying his first big festival experience.That is, until he wakes up in the back of a stranger’s car, with a raw pierced nipple and wearing dex pants, after a night of sex with a blue-painted Smurf girl. The road of excess, for suburban Nick, leads to some rueful, mud-caked wisdom.But that’s the oldest story – indeed, going back millennia – about the effect of a festival. It’s a moment in space and time when humans come together to throw off their regular cares and duties, and actively seek personal transformation and renewal.Festivals are supposed to turn you upside down. The great philosopher of festivity and carnival, the Russian scholar Mikhail Bakhtin, called them “second worlds”. In the medieval “feasts of fools” that he studied, traditional authorities and hierarchies were toyed with, inverted and toppled, through performance, costume and ritual – if only for a few days a year.That’s certainly the mythic story about music festivals that overhangs every buzzing summer season. They are all still largely following the template set down in the counterculture of the 60s and 70s, by events such as Woodstock and Monterey (the biennial Glastonbury, taking a rest this year, is part of this tradition).Nomads come with their tents and create a temporary city on a rural plain. Hedonism, personal experimentation and gluttony become the norm rather than the exception. At the centre of it all, the shamen – nowadays standing on giant digitally enhanced stages, brandishing guitars and microphones – summon up the collective emotions of vast crowds.Yes, there’s something ancient and elemental about even the most modern and cutting-edge of festivals. But, as someone who organises and enjoys them, I think the form is ready for another new stage in its long evolution.Festivals are becoming the places where we can experiment with the kind of societies we want to be – at a time when those destinations aren’t at all clear to us. A few festive weekends last month alerted me to this potential. At the beginning of July, I curated FutureFest, devised by the innovation foundation Nesta, which aims to celebrate the possibilities of tech, culture and politics. In the glass-and-iron mini-city of London’s Tobacco Dock, we had Nicola Sturgeon vaunting a progressive Scotland. The rapper Akala and author Paul Mason evoked a post-British and post-capitalist future, while the musician Imogen Heap pulled sounds out of the air with her techno-gloves.The next day, I found myself conducting a “collaboratory” at Noisily, a psychedelic dance festival in the depths of the Coney Woods in Leicestershire. A few yards away, the woods heaved with trance music, yet our talks, on topics such as automation, basic income, localisationand the feminisation of politics, had been full of attentive souls.And a fortnight later, I was presenting at Macclesfield’s Bluedot – a science and art-rock festival under the vast bowl of the old Jodrell Bank radio telescope. (No festival wishing to connect with its ancient traditions could wish for a more monumental and cosmic object.)There I found full tents of people willing to enthusiastically explore scenarios about northern coastal cities facing water levels rising by two metres, 80 years from now. I’ve been hearing many other stories from the festival circuit about topical debate and future visioning in this year’s programming. For example, the just-concluded Lunar Festival in Warwickshire (with Goldfrapp and the Stranglers headlining) ran a new strand called Journey to Nutopia. This was inspired by John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s “conceptual country” (“Nutopia has no land, no boundaries, no passports, only people”). The speakers included engineers planning to make houses energy-independent, scientists exploring how LSD can be used therapeutically, and ex-Occupy veterans on the next wave of activism.And if we’re looking at festivals that evoke possible futures, desirable and undesirable, we have to mention Boomtown Fair – a vast science fiction-like stage set built on a Hampshire estate. Each year, 60,000 revellers are invited to play their part in its dystopian narratives. There’s a sceptical note to be struck about how much engagement with harsh reality there is (or even should be) in festivals. Historians would say that festivity is often a societal safety valve – a way to let off collective steam in a contained and occasional way, lest the whole system blow up from its internal pressures. Festivals might well be “second worlds” – but do we really bring anything of their idealisms and revelations back to our daily lives?Perhaps it’s less about the content and more about the overall experience. (Which, even in terms of raw statistics, is becoming considerable. The industry body UK Music notes that, in 2016, there were more than 500 events and 3.9 million people attending, sustaining 40,000 jobs in 2016, there was a direct and indirect spend of £1.7bn.)My hunch is that one of the things festivals may be doing really well is preparing us for a fully automated future. Artificial intelligence and robotics are starting to absorb the more routine tasks of our jobs, mental and physical. So what activities will we start to turn towards and value next?The festival (or festivity in general) could be one answer. Bringing people together joyfully in a real space – to explore their dreams, pleasures and ambitions, in a friendly and sensual atmosphere – feels like something uniquely human that we can still do particularly well.Even the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, spoke a few months ago about automation compelling a shift to an economy that is more entrepreneurial, bespoke, creative and empathetic. That sounds to me like the essential characteristics of the best festival experience – whether you’re making them, or just shaking your tail feathers at them.Call it engagism rather than escapism. Festivals are about more than just summer fun.• Pat Kane is the lead curator of FutureFest, and co-initiator of The Alternative UK"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3bce2f4b0e7b015d1907542d957534654041503/559_179_3038_1823/master/3038.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48ece1a837a4e2c7682072754046d0c7","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A Sumatran orangutan, fireflies mating and a sea lion cooling off in record-breaking Californian heat are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce6069ddd18202e4faab6c79a6e3ec9c93d93e50/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c4fa55625ca92d633cd0664236c98a4","title":"jose mourinho manchester united board forget the name","story":"• Portuguese referred to lack of Manchester United transfers• Mourinho was speaking after 2-1 win over Leicester CityJosé Mourinho appeared to take aim at Ed Woodward, Manchester United’s executive vice-chairman, for not sanctioning all of his transfer targets, with the manager saying maybe his title should be downgraded to “head coach”.The Portuguese’s side beat Leicester City 2-1 in Friday night’s Premier League opener at Old Trafford thanks to a Paul Pogba penalty and a late Luke Shaw strike.Yet after Mourinho was denied the signing of an elite centre-back in the summer window he voiced his frustrations by hinting United’s board, led by Woodward, are acting as de facto football experts by having the final say over him regarding recruitment.“It will be a difficult season for everybody, not just for us,” the 55-year-old said. “I had my plans for many months and I find myself with the market closed in a situation I did not think I would be in. It’s the last time I speak about it. It’s over, the market is closed. That’s football management. I think football is changing and managers should be called head coaches.”He added: “We play against a team that invest more than us. They spent more money than us, so in the Premier League we must get used to teams with players of the same quality that we have. Forget the name, the history, the shirt, every match is difficult.”Nonetheless Mourinho was pleased with his team’s display, singling out Pogba and Shaw for particular praise, and the overall spirit.Claude Puel, the visiting manager, said: “It was a shame to concede this goal at the beginning of the game. We allowed them to remain deep and close the space.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c90f610ba6528d3e780a70e08fac6332e1f74bbd/0_122_2990_1794/master/2990.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=516ee4a764eba046282753d95b7e89ee","title":"manchester united leicester premier league match report","story":"Was that a smile on José Mourinho’s face? Blink, and you might have missed it, but at least Manchester United have begun the new campaign with a victory and after all the sullenness of pre-season, the complaints about the club’s transfer business and the overwhelming suspicion that the manager is having one hell of a sulk, this was a reminder that winning football matches makes everything feel so much better. For now at least, Old Trafford feels like a happy place again.Not that this victory provided too much evidence that United are genuinely equipped to improve on last season’s position as runners-up. They struggled to impose themselves for long spells against a robust and adventurous Leicester side and, briefly, it was a wave of apprehension engulfing the stadium when Jamie Vardy’s stoppage-time header gave the away side the opportunity to pull off a dramatic feat of escapology. The drama finished with a Leicester corner from which Kasper Schmeichel, their own goalkeeper, won the header, having made the kind of forward foray that must have reminded the Old Trafford crowd of his father’s time in the same profession. If that header had gone in, we can only imagine what Mourinho might have had to say afterwards.As it was, he restricted himself to only a couple of veiled digs towards the club’s hierarchy – his latest line being that perhaps he should be known as a head coach, rather than the manager, if the club did not want to go after his transfer targets - and United could reflect on a satisfying though unspectacular evening’s work, as it often is on his watch. Paul Pogba, the game’s outstanding performer, carried on where he left off in the World Cup. Fred, the £52m acquisition from Shakhtar Donetsk, had a competent debut and Luke Shaw’s confidence should be soothed from hooking in the goal that ultimately decided the match.Leicester, meanwhile, have not started a top-ision season with an away win since beating Aston Villa in 1933. They have won only one of their last ten opening-day fixtures and made life unnecessarily difficult for themselves with the silly handball from Daniel Amartey that gave Pogba the chance to open the scoring with a penalty inside the opening three minutes.At other times, however, Claude Puel must have been encouraged by the way his team took the game to their opponents. Indeed, it would not have been absurd if the visitors had left with a draw bearing in mind the balance of play when the score was 1-0. James Maddison showed why his new employers were willing to pay £24m to sign him from Norwich City. Demarai Gray seemed keen to explore the theory that Matteo Darmian, deputising as United’s right-back, might be vulnerable and at one point late in the first half the away end could even be heard taunting Mourinho with the “park the bus” song favoured by Manchester City’s followers.In truth, it was not quite that troublesome for the home team but, equally, United’s supporters might have been entitled to expect more from their players. Marcus Rashford, in particular, looked rusty. Alexis Sánchez has rarely shown Old Trafford the gifts he once displayed for Arsenal and perhaps it was inevitable that United would endure some difficult moments at the back bearing in mind their defence was made up of four players who were largely used as understudies last season.Harry Maguire, one of the centre-backs Mourinho coveted over the summer, was playing for the opposition, reminding us why Gareth Southgate had eulogised in the World Cup about the player’s knack of “getting his bonce on everything.” Southgate was here, too, and no doubt will be pleased to see Shaw back in the United team, looking fit and confident. Yet the attention of the England manager might also have been drawn to the opposition left-back, Ben Chilwell, who had a fine game.Shaw had one awkward moment when Vardy dispossessed him close to his own penalty area but he got away with that one and made amends in the 82nd minute by surging forwards, controlling Juan Mata’s pass and bustling past Ricardo Pereira before turning a diagonal shot past Schmeichel.Vardy’s goal was an instinctive close-range header after a cross from the right missed everyone, spinning back towards him off the post, but Leicester could not conjure up an equaliser and will reflect on the moment, with only 75 seconds on the clock, when Sanchez let fly from the edge of the penalty area and Amartey gave away the penalty. Wes Morgan got in the way of the shot but the next Leicester player to touch the ball did so by jutting out his arm to bring it under control. Pogba was wearing the captain’s armband in the absence of Antonio Valencia and, after one of the slowest run-ups imaginable, it was an elegantly struck penalty to send the ball into the top corner.Pogba’s selection might have come as a surprise given that he returned from his post-World Cup break only four days earlier but that, perhaps, is the attitude that Mourinho wants to see from his most expensive player. Pogba lasted until the 84th minute and Mourinho described him as a “monster”. The nutmeg from Pogba on Ricardo Pereira was a joy. Andreas Pereira, back from his loan arrangement with Valencia, fitted in neatly as a deep-lying midfielder, but United were let down too often in attacking positions by their final pass. They won, and they were happy, but when Mourinho talked about the “complete performance‚“ he was meaning Shaw, rather than the team as a whole."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09865bfca6a3916215098e2d1e17d1eac72647e7/0_103_3584_2150/master/3584.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26ebb0ea1a3d59d5f7453aad53c2822c","title":"the big premier league preview football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning, Andy Brassell and John Brewin for Football Weekly’s bumper preview of the 2018-19 Premier League seasonRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

In the 90s, I lived between Lagos and London (heavy on Lagos). When I landed back in London permanently, I was itching to leave again. First California, teaching little girls art and horse-riding (never at the same time). Then Berlin. And, as of two and a half years ago, at the grand age of 33, I made my biggest, and most taxing move yet, swapping my east London postcode for a zip code in Brooklyn.Ah, 2016, that seemingly cursed year, which started with the death of David Bowie, continued with the Brexit referendum, before culminating in the demise of George Michael at Christmas. When I left England, we were still part of a (barely) united Europe, and the US president was an erudite black man with a spouse who retained an uncommon grace in the face of hostile conditions. Things aren’t so simple any more. My plan had been to walk in the shoes of the foreign correspondent – think our woman in Alabama, rather than our man in Havana – following a path paved by Alexis de Tocqueville, or Alistair Cooke. I’m more than well versed in the art of being the foreigner in many rooms, even if my foreignness resides only in the minds of the others present: the man who complimented my “very good English” at a London station, say, or the countless people over the years who have asked where I’m really from. But in New York, I was a different type of foreign despite our common language, a stranger in a strange land. So I have been learning, observing, interpreting and elucidating the US’s many customs through a filter markedly different from many of those who have come before me. And, when necessary, I have interjected. Like, what’s up with all the flag love? I have communed with Prince fans after his death in Minneapolis. It turns out that being black in the US is not so different from being black in Britain: in both, we “enjoy” a status that is simultaneously hypervisible and invisible. The joys of my identity are similar: I am part of a glorious sisterhood that affirms me in a language that transcends geography. And the same is true of the problems, even when the tools being used to uphold our common problem – white supremacy – have their own local historical… flavour. The sins of Empire mutated into the sins of Jim CrowEven so, I cannot lie: the accent helps. I am reaping the rewards of a lingering American enchantment with a certain British accent. I have had free drinks slid down bars, and people clutching their throats in delight when I start speaking. I’m suddenly a person who disarms not with my own natural charm, but by virtue of an accent that is just an accident of birth. A British accent can be an asset to a journalist when it comes wrapped in my skin, it turns into something even more useful. People tell me things and I can’t explain why. Is it because I’m not a “local” black person? Does my foreignness make them more open to talking to me?To be a black British woman (I’m trying to be a carefree black girl, as the once internet-popular catchphrase encourages, but the world today always let me) is always cause for rejoicing, sometimes in the midst of immense psychic sorrow. My time in the US has coincided with some of the most awful chapters in today’s push for social justice and civil rights. The police killing of Philando Castile in July 2016 was followed by the police shooting of Korryn Gaines a month later: #SayHerName, distinct but concurrent with #BlackLivesMatter, was another campaign seeking level humanhood. But I have friends here, and a cluster of houseplants. I travel and eat well. Being a foreigner with means has opened up the country, for work and leisure, finding new parts of myself in new places. There have been highs and lows. I have danced in a New Orleans jazz club and cried at multiple Broadway shows. I have attended protests and reported the trial of a murderous white supremacist.But when I do the stocktake of what will probably be called The American Years in my memoirs, and weigh what was against what is, I am left with a surplus. If you let it, travel broadens the mind. I have sought a word to sum up how I feel and only a nonsense one from The Simpsons will do. I feel… embiggened."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccd5681ff1f596b9c56abad97f1707189ea06a93/1087_700_5982_3590/master/5982.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d2774963016a5d22d2d6030d70f9116","title":"offering something people didnt get meet gal dem team","story":"The gal-dem collective is disrupting traditional media – all from their tiny HQ in a London car park If you wanted to find a kind of ground zero for gentrification, you could do worse than here: an office block carved out of a concrete multistorey car park in south-east London that now fizzes with the cumulative energy of dozens of startups. Yellow “Ahead Only” signs still mark the lanes that link digital media companies with eateries whose lunch dishes are garnished with labneh and almonds.The bigger businesses have garnished their parking spaces, too, with pot plants and deckchairs. But I have scaled these levels to find gal-dem, the award-winning online magazine run by women and non-binary people of colour. By contrast, its HQ is squeezed into a minuscule space about the size of one car parking spot. Their occupation here is an ambivalent one, both physically and metaphorically. The gal-dem journalists inhabit the space lightly – a few shelves and A1 magazine covers the only gesture towards permanence. There are few other people of colour working here.What gal-dem lack in space, they make up for in energy. As I enter the tiny newsroom, I find four women – none older than 25 – sitting at their laptops in a row, facing a chipboard wall, the conversation darting casually around what seem to be everyday subjects in gal-dem lan. Liv Little, the magazine’s founder and editor-in-chief, looks suitably playful for an architect of media subversion, wearing a deep blue jumpsuit and running a hand casually over her shaved head.“I was in Deptford market and a glass of wine there costs £6 now!” laments Niellah Arboine, gal-dem’s lifestyle editor, seated regally at the end of the long desk, with sleek braids and distinctive lime slice earrings.“But was it delicious though?” Little probes cheekily.“Yes!” Arboine confesses, laughing. “And, apparently it doesn’t give you a hangover, because it has so few sulphites it in.”Little is both excited at the prospect of securing a major US star for the forthcoming annual gal-dem print cover, and aware of how much the whole process is costing her. “I’ve been chanting every morning that we get her,” she says, describing herself as a practising Buddhist. “I had to go through three inner circles, and those phone calls to the US are expensive!”The team have previously interviewed everyone from Oprah and Lupita Nyong’o to British musician Ray BLK the fact that such famous women are keen to collaborate with gal-dem, while the editor-in-chief frets about the price of the phone calls required to arrange the next star, is a marker of the reality of life at this major media disrupter.Little, who is 24, grew up in south-east London, with Guyanese and Jamaican families, and a friendship group representative of the erse area. When she went to study politics at the University of Bristol she struggled with the all-encompassing whiteness her student experience entailed. “I had never been confronted with racism until I went to Bristol,” she explains. “It was overwhelming and I was stressed. You become woke.”Little met Leyla Reynolds, who as art director at gal-dem has helped build the magazine’s reputation for standout graphics and illustrations. Then a fellow politics student at Bristol, Reynolds was frustrated at the, as she saw it, lack of interest of university staff in her chosen dissertation topic, the political contribution of black British art in the 1980s. The final straw for both women, it seems, was the joint experience of taking a class on feminism, only to find it taught by, as Little describes him, “this white man”.“We thought, ‘We know so much about feminism, what is he doing?’” Little recalls. She began posting on message boards about connecting with others in Bristol and beyond who were also dissatisfied with the lack of ersity on campus and on the syllabus.Registering the domain gal-dem – “it sounded like the most natural way to describe a group of my peers” – Little and Reynolds began growing a network. They highlighted some of their favourite articles from publications they admired under the hashtag #sixtysassydays (a name that now makes them cringe). “I had this idea – we were just sharing content that we liked for 60 days before we launched,” Little says. “It was a good way to build up a bit of a network.”Little now disparages gal-dem’s first incarnation (“Such bad social media!” she exclaims), but it worked, attracting attention among other women and non-binary people of colour in Bristol, including Antonia Odunlami, whom Little and Reynolds met at a networking dinner in the city. Together with Odunlami, now music editor at gal-dem, they began brainstorming on how to grow a passion project that was still in its infancy, along with the confidence in themselves.Along with that confidence came their first event – an informal get together in a London coffee shop, where people who were interested could come, as Little describes it, “for a really chilled meetup”. It was here that they first encountered Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff, now gal-dem’s deputy editor, whose writing on her experiences of using Tinder they had already read, and admired.Only three years later, this group of young women, which now includes more than a dozen editorial staff and numerous regular contributors – many of them with almost no prior professional or media experience – has shaken up the mainstream press. They give a glimpse, alarming for some, of a future in which the white, male perspective will not monopolise. “What we are offering is something people didn’t get before,” Little says. “As women and non-binary people of colour, people assumed that we all had the same thoughts, or the same upbringing. And we are showing that there are so many different perspectives within these very broad categories.”Pieces such as The Virginity Paradox I Face As A British Muslim, in which the writer Sara Jafari questions her commitment to no sex before marriage as a feminist or The Vagina Affliction More Common Amongst Women Of Colour, on how women of colour are more prone to bacterial vaginosis (which can “really piss on your chips, side eye your sex life, or kill your confidence”), are just two examples of how qualitatively different gal-dem’s offering is. The scale of gal-dem’s current – never mind future – plans are dizzying. Reynolds, wearing a floral dress, her dark brown hair streaked with blond, speaks proudly of a project the team recently created, a commemoration of Windrush at 70 in collaboration with the mayor of London at his office in City Hall. “It was a three-part thing: a Caribbean kitchen installation, 12 absolutely incredible portraits of black British Caribbean women from Windrush to now, and a series by the artist Rochelle White, who creates huge photographs of Caribbean food dishes and places them against these luxe backdrops.“We have this collective amnesia about the impact of Caribbean women in the UK,” Reynolds says, adding that she is hoping the Windrush exhibition will now tour the country, visiting schools and community spaces. “We need to make sure this stuff has a legacy, rather than a moment.”Soon after we meet, gal-dem will launch Rewriting The Canon, a literary course in conjunction with the London department store Liberty, repositioning writers of colour, whose legacy is so often overlooked. The demand has taken everyone by surprise: during the day I am with her, Little spends most of her time preoccupied with the dilemma of more people having subscribed than can actually be accommodated.Then there is a forthcoming gal-dem book, and a collaboration with the Afropunk festival. All this adds to gal-dem regular events, gal-dem Sugar (club nights and museum takeovers at which the team fill the usually quiet spaces of museums with installations, films, talks, DJs and all-round partying) and commercial projects that have so far included collaborations with Red Bull, Asos and Nike. Little is also signed to the model agency Storm, and has appeared in Vogue for a feature entitled Meet The New Suffragettes.Corporate gigs provide some financial relief from the unpaid work of the gal-dem magazine itself, but are not without hazards. “It’s hard,” Little concedes. “The boundaries are constantly shifting. The way media and brands and advertising are set up, it’s against people of colour. To find those brands that are not part of that, or that have a good ethos, they are few and far between. We say no to loads of stuff.”I join today’s four-strong gal-dem team for lunch at a Jamaican cafe inside the nearby market. It’s run by a no-nonsense Rastafarian who seems to have found a happy harmony between the black traditions of pre-existing residents in this part of London and the new influx of clean food-loving hipsters. While eating our chickpea curries, roti and dumplings, we talk about the memories associated with certain foods the experiences of queer people of colour, and the dilemmas of coming out to family elders. It’s another reminder of how personal the issues that make up so much of gal-dem’s published material really are reflecting the complexities of navigating sexuality, race and class. The magazine runs content that deals frankly with the daily struggles these identities entail, such as My Sense Of Home Shifted When I Came Out, about the sadness of having to create distance with one’s family and Why We Need To Dispel The Myth That Ethnic Minorities Are Aspirational By Default, challenging the narrative that it is white working-class boys whom society is leaving behind.For Daisy Ifama, who grew up in a small town in the West Country where she had cleaning and dinner lady jobs at her own school, while still a pupil, studying at Goldsmiths in London exposed her to class elitism. “I just didn’t know that lots of private school people went to university,” says the gal-dem video editor. “My teacher was like, ‘Put your hands up if you didn’t got to private school’, and only I and my friend put our hands up. I had never been friends with someone who had gone to private school before.”Arboine says she grew up “in a very multicultural, beautiful bubble, where I was used to learning about all these amazing black people”, only to experience the shock of racism at university in Aberystwyth. “I had never felt so othered in my life.” Reynolds moved from London to Suffolk at the age of 11. “I had been at primary school in the city of London, in an insanely multicultural area, then I came to Ipswich and people were like ‘Because you’re a bit black, you’re quarter cast.’ And I was like, ‘That’s not OK.’“I remember crying once when someone said the N-word in a joke,” Reynolds recalls. “And people saying, ‘It’s fine, black people aren’t being killed any more’, and stuff like that. It all has an impact on how openly you talk about race.”Little, meanwhile, went to private school, the result of her mother’s determination to provide her daughter with the best education she could. “My mum is a very hardworking woman who nearly killed herself to pay for my education,” she says. “She found a way to make stuff work. I’ve always worked, too. When I was at Bristol, doing my dissertation, I was a nanny, I was also working in a burger restaurant. My hair started to fall out because I was really stressed. We have all pushed ourselves to extremes to do this.” There’s a sense among all the team that this was both an incredibly tenacious choice, but also not really a choice at all, so certain were they it had to be done.Gal-dem attracts the audience it does, and the brands desperate to resonate with that audience, because of what’s often described as “authenticity”. But the gal-dem team see it in less grandiose terms, as being true to their own experience. One of the magazine’s most popular features was Arbione’s Letter To My Younger Self: Your Body Is Yours And Yours Alone, which she – and thousands of others, it seems – still turns to now. “I was in this weird limbo part of my life. It just started out as a letter. And then it just kept going and going.” The letter is searing and sweet, but painful, too. “In the nicest way possible, you look a bit like one of those Lego men. Your hair was never meant to be straight and that’s all right,” Arbione writes. “There’s no right way to be black… black is who you are, not what you do.”This honesty is a simple commitment, and gal-dem will not be apologising for the success it has delivered. “At the beginning, when you get offered loads of stuff, you are gassed and feel really privileged,” Little says. “Now I feel like these institutions are really privileged to have us in their space. And that is the biggest piece of advice I give to anyone now when I speak: know that you are so valuable. What you have, they don’t have. And that’s refreshing.”• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.If you would like your comment to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5673e592d5cc346b138da5f9756b84c526de89b4/0_263_4063_2438/master/4063.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4b780ca2b332d416b5028a2b12e912e","title":"aunty taught power communal bathing hammam iman amrani","story":"As they scrape the pollution off my skin, I am scolded for not going to the hammam in LondonI’m counting down the days until I go on my annual trip back to Algeria, or “bled” as we call it, the motherland.Tickets cost a stupid amount, because the big Eid falls in August this year. But it will be worth it when I get out of the hammam on the first day.When I was little, we went to the public baths because there was no running water in the flats where my family lived – in Oran, Algeria’s second city. Now it’s a choice. Tata Houeria, my favourite uncle’s wife, jumps at any excuse to go to the hammam, especially when I’m visiting and she can get her hands on me. She has taught me the power of communal bathing.The hammam is not just about washing it’s a social activity that brings the women of the family together. It’s also about ritual Houeria takes pleasure in carefully packing the soap, loofahs and stools into a special bag. Once inside, women exchange their black abayas for white towels before stepping into the hot, steamy room. Toddlers and the elderly are bathed by family members while they gossip with friends. As soon as I feel the steam, I’m transported back to being very small and stroking my aunt’s buttery-soft skin.She always finds the strongest masseuse, often the one with a cigarette dangling from her lips, to give me a proper scrub down on a marble slab. As they scrape the pollution off my skin, I am scolded for not going to the hammam in London. My feeble attempts to exfoliate can’t compare with what these women do.My cousins and I now extend the ritual with a trip to the salon to get our hair done.

Everyone knows that a lot of what you see on social media is fake: it’s just the best bits of everyone’s day. So, to stay sane, I try to take regular breaks and hang out with my husband and children (my second child was born last month). I also make sure that if I post a photo of myself looking amazing, I also do some Instagram stories of myself with no makeup on, looking terrible. I want my audience to see a realistic representation of me, especially as a lot of them are quite young.I’m 29 now and started experimenting with makeup when I was 16, as I became conscious of my looks at secondary school in Cardiff. I am glad it happened later in my teen years at that time, I had an eating disorder and I don’t know how bad that could have got if I had started getting into beauty products and looking at myself any earlier. By 18, I had established my own personal style and knew fashion was the industry I wanted to work in long term. I now like to test new products and have made some great discoveries, but there are a few favourites I always return to. These are the five I can’t live without.I use a brow strengthener by Shavata (£18, 8ml) on my eyelashes, rather than my brows. It’s essentially a tube of castor oil, but with an easy, roll-on applicator. After a phase of getting (and yanking off) eyelash extensions left me with 10 lashes on each eye, I tried this for a month of intensive rehab and it really helped.For the past month I’ve been using Alpha-H Liquid Gold (£33.50, 100ml) every night and my forehead wrinkles are nearly gone. Those wrinkles do my head in, as I’m always making silly facial expressions in my YouTube videos.

To understand, I mean. A few years ago, I started dressing in a way that made me feel seen feel comfortable feel myself. But you saw it as an affront, a subversion of what is good and right for me. “Why the short hair? Why the masculine clothing? Don’t you know you look like a boy?” That was kind of the point.Your intrusive questions came to a head when, in a heated conversation, you brought up how I was obviously trying to look like a boy. You just had to ask me: “Do you want to be a boy?”If you had refrained from commenting on how you saw being “transgender” as impossible, or fake, or unreal, or a joke right in front of me all those years ago, maybe I wouldn’t have been so afraid to say “Yes… sort of.”If you had tried to understand, instead of calling me impressionable and discounting the validity of my gender expression, maybe we would still be talking. Maybe I wouldn’t have hidden my transness for more than two years to satisfy the implicit expectations of me not to be a boy.As it is, you decided to ask other people questions, to discuss my gender with my siblings without me being present, debating whether I was transgender or maybe just gay. As if masculine straight women don’t exist. As if gender is not a beautiful spectrum, which sexuality sometimes intersects with, but is not dictated by.I am not straight, or a woman but that’s not the point.

Here’s how it wentI tend to come to things late: Twitter, The Wire and puberty were all delayed arrivals into my life. And losing my virginity was no different. I rocked up to the University of Manchester in 2010 tragically chaste and sexually frustrated. It was what you might call a pre-“woke” epoch we were still drunk on lad culture. My flatmate Liam quickly fashioned himself as the top lad he would confess later that he’d made a secret bet that he could shag every girl in the group.By the middle of my first year, my turn had come. I was in his room on the pretence of “watching a film”, but the foregone conclusion – have sex, then pretend it never happened – was punctured irreparably. As we kissed, Liam whispered: “I’ve never had sex with a black girl before” – the anti-aphrodisiac for women of colour everywhere. That was the end of that. Luckily, university was full of other young, drunk people with plenty of leisure time, so it wasn’t too difficult to get laid. But an awareness of my race, and a persistent bout of thrush, followed me through university and beyond.I had spent most of my teens avoiding thinking about my ethnicity blending in and miracle boob growth were my principal wishes at that age. But at university my sense of “difference” was heightened. It wasn’t just confined to the obvious: the lack of BME students or academics, or the history lecturer who claimed that British colonialists were well-intentioned. It began to crop up in my love life – such as the time I was asked whether my vagina was pink inside (FYI, it is). The more I learned about racism and feminism, the smaller the pool of potential suitors became. While being thoughtful, funny, smart and able to put up with my unbearable flaws is a must, I became aware that my match also has to be serious about social justice to be my type on (recycled, sustainably sourced) paper. Today, my work involves researching the links between race and inequality for two thinktanks. If “woke” means being alert to injustice in society, especially racism, then I am on constant high alert. A potential partner needs to be at least on medium alert for it to be workable. Eventually, I took a vow to date woke men only. But only after numerous bad experiences.It was on exchange at the University of Toronto, aged 21, where the first racist domino fell. No longer shackled by my virginity, I woke up naked but for a coat on a stranger’s bathroom floor. I was pleased to find it was the flat of the best-looking guy at the frat party. We dated for a few months, but unfortunately Sam turned out to be a Republican and a biological racist. At a party, he told a confused group of fellow students that “black people are biologically predisposed to violence”, before tagging “Kim isn’t like that”, on to the end. Lucky me. An important lesson was learned: check if they’re overtly racist before intercourse.I’ve shared a bed and overpriced meal with some less obviously deplorable offenders back home in the UK. With a university boyfriend, the incompatibility started small. I collected newspaper clippings about institutional racism in the politan police, but he wasn’t convinced. I asked him not to smoke weed with me in public, explaining that the rules were different for me. He didn’t understand why I cared. After we broke up, he admitted that he never spoke up when people made racist or sexist comments at work. I knew our friendship was finally over when he sent me an ill-judged treatise on race from the white male’s perspective while “finding himself” in India.James Baldwin said that to be black and relatively conscious is “to be in a rage almost all the time”. It’s not the sexiest Tinder tagline, but dating someone “not woke” does leave you in a state of constant fury. I’m all for debate, but I don’t want my relationship to be reminiscent of Question Time. I’m looking for someone to be angry with, not at. There are enough other reasons in any relationship to be enraged, so why add another one?But even after my vow to find a woke guy, things didn’t go smoothly. There was the man who, while nice, wanted to talk about “whether Cecil Rhodes was that bad” before I’d even had a morning cuppa. While on a date at a smart restaurant, he asked whether I had a dad, because he knew this was “a problem” in my community. Once it became clear that he only dated women of colour, my doubts grew. Sure, people have types, but nothing makes you feel more like a trinket than being chosen for your ethnicity. No one would say “all white people” are their type, apart from white supremacists. People specify and give details: brown hair, blue eyes, tall or short. Perhaps they’ll even talk about personality! Black and mixed-race people are not a type.But after months of dates, attending parties together and the purchase of a Scrabble set, I had no idea whether or not I was still single. The funny thing about the Foreign Office is that it tends to make staff leave the country for years at a time, with no consideration of my dating plight. Would I have to start the whole, wretched woke man search from scratch?Kind of. Turns out our expiration date is coming up faster than expected: he’s getting a new post abroad. So when Weekend asked me if I would take part in their Blind Date series, I said yes.

I hoped a MyHeritage test would bring me the peace I needed my Irish mother had never been able to give me any information about my biological father. Raised by her and my white dad, I’d always longed for a country to attribute my blackness to, or for help answering the ubiquitous “Where are you from?” question. I’d spent years making up exotic-sounding combinations to justify my appearance (some days Jamaican-Spanish-Swedish other days half Brazilian, or half Iranian). But, at 24, I was done with occupying a box of black ambiguity. Could I finally get a clear answer?The results arrived by email on a summer’s day last year. I clicked on the “ethnicity estimate” link, which offers an analysis of DNA by country, my heart pounding as I scanned the digital map.I had no cultural knowledge of Nigeria should I now start claiming it as my own? Did the results mean my very distant ancestors were Nigerian, or that my biological father was probably from there? Why did my features resemble a typical west African? I felt more confused than ever.This wasn’t quite what the adverts had promised. Targeted marketing for home-testing kits shows smiling (often mixed-race) models under the banner “find out your ethnicity”, or urges people to book holidays based on their “DNA story”. It’s estimated the industry will be worth a staggering £7.7bn by 2022 in the last year alone, market leader AncestryDNA pulled in $1bn in revenue.While DNA home tests are more popular than ever, people are starting to raise questions about what happens after the results land. Concerns about the storage of sensitive genetic information were highlighted recently, when an open-source DNA testing site, GEDmatch, was used by the police to identify California’s Golden Gate Killer. As well as privacy concerns, there’s the emotional fallout of receiving confusing or life-changing results. Identities that have been cherished by families for generations can be dismantled overnight.Ayshah Blackman, in her 50s, is of Caribbean descent and lives in London. She had always known two things about her family: that they had Indian heritage, and that her father had another daughter he wasn’t in touch with. Last year, with his permission, she set about trying to track down her half-sister through the UKTV show The Secrets In My Family.Blackman was encouraged to take the AncestryDNA test as part of the programme, and thrilled to eventually connect with her long-lost sibling, living on the other side of London. But she was shocked by the details of the results according to the test, Ayshah had no Indian DNA at all. “It made me question my ancestry, the fact that I might not be what I thought I was. I began to think that my grandmother had had an affair, that my mother had an affair. My imagination ran riot,” she tells me.For people of African descent, whose inidual and collective histories are blurred by the legacies of colonialism, slavery and rape, what they know about their identities is particularly important. Blackman felt that one of the narratives woven through her family had been broken.“That little thing of not having any Indian ancestry is now sitting on my shoulder – I may not be as much a part of this tribe as I thought I was,” she says. “If I had to do it again, I wouldn’t.”YouTube is full of videos of people revealing their DNA results, often with “click me” headlines such as What Am I? and I Was Lied To – My Shocking Results. They film themselves “unboxing” test kits like a new toy and taking cheek swabs, and then cut to footage in which they analyse their results. Many seem astonished by what they find, and begin to question whether their parents have been unfaithful, or whether they have been misled about their heritage some clips are heartbreakingly difficult to watch.Rachel Nye, 30, from London, was also left without a clear answer. Nye’s mother has a black mother and a white father, but Nye has never known exactly where her grandmother was born.“My nana died in 2008 but was always very vague about where she came from. She often gave different answers,” Nye says. “Some days she was British-born, other days she was from Barbados, some days she was African. I remember seeing two passports – one of them was Kenyan – but the names and dates of birth were different.”Nye says she was frustrated by the lack of country breakdown within Africa despite the fact the vast majority of the world’s genetic variation comes from the continent, DNA testing companies often have very few samples from Africa.23andMe has launched a number of initiatives to redress this. In 2016, the company launched the African Genetics Project, offering free DNA kits to people with all four grandparents born in the same African country, or from the same ethnic or tribal group. Now it has launched the Populations Collaborations Program, which encourages researchers studying remote populations to submit their data to the website.But questions have been raised about the ethics of European and American scientists harvesting genetic information from Africans and African scientists for economic gain. 23andMe has announced plans to share the test results of five million customers with GlaxoSmithKline, the drugs giant, in order to facilitate the design of new drugs. (Users are asked if they want to participate in scientific research when they sign up.)Privacy is a major concern for everyone using these sites, but perhaps more so for those from minority backgrounds. For those who are already discriminated against, having their genome used against them – for example, in the criminal justice system – could have serious implications. AncestryDNA’s privacy agreement states it can only share a customer’s DNA with research partners with explicit consent but it could disclose personal information to law enforcement if requested. (An internal report revealed that in 2017, AncestryDNA received 34 law enforcement requests, and provided information to 31.) MyHeritage asks customers to email if they want their sample removed from its database, though a representative tells me that the company does not sell or share DNA data with third parties. “We would need the explicit permission of our users – we do not own anyone’s DNA”, I am told on the phone. In 2010, to illustrate the privacy risks, researchers from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Massachusetts identified nearly 50 people who had participated in an anonymous genomic study, based on publicly accessible information.There are many scientific limitations to the home DNA test. “These companies aren’t actually testing your ancestry at all,” says Mark Thomas, professor of evolutionary genetics at University College London. “They’re problematic in their claims to be able to infer an inidual’s ancestry.”There are a few reasons for this. First, the genetic information these DNA testing companies hold is based on living populations. When you send your spit off in a little tube, it is specific snippets, or markers, in your genome (the total collection of DNA that resides in your cells) that are being analysed, and then compared to the markers of others who are good representatives for distinct regions or ethnicities around the world. But as Thomas notes, the companies are only looking at very recent samples, from a relatively small group, in one specific database. “They are just saying: ‘If I wanted to make your genome, I could pull bits of your DNA from people all over the world who are around today. And this is just one way I could do it,’” he says.The databases are skewed towards different parts of the world, too. “23andMe has more American customers, and AncestryDNA has more British and Australian,” Thomas explains. “And none of these companies asks: ‘What do we know about the genetics of the past, and which of those past inferred genetic clusters do we get our ancestry from?’ They are giving us what the market wants, not what the genetics tells us.”There’s also the question of just how much information is passed down through a person’s DNA. Thomas explains that we probably inherit very few genes from our ancestors DNA is inherited in “chunks” that break up the further back in time you go. “You start with two parents, then four grandparents, then eight great-grandparents, it goes to 16, 32 and so on. And by the time you go 10 generations back, there are ancestors from whom you inherit no DNA.”I ask Dr Yaniv Erlich, who works for MyHeritage, how the company’s “ethnicity estimate” is created. He says they define good DNA “representatives” for English people as having “at least all of their eight great-grandparents born in England”. He believes you can “estimate that present-day iniduals probably reflect populations from about 200 to 300 years ago, as they never got DNA of any other ethnicity. Evolution is not acting fast enough to create any substantial changes.”But as the American academic Sheldon Krimsky and journalist David Cay Johnston explain in their online consumer guide, Ancestry DNA Testing And Privacy, markers maketh the result. “Today’s markers do not necessarily match the markers of 400 years ago, during the African colonisation and enslavement period,” they write. In other words, markers are inconsistent sometimes they’re passed on and sometimes they’re not. There might be a lot of genetic markers Nigerians share, for example, but that are not necessarily exclusive to them.Thomas tells me it is very possible that my birth father could be from anywhere, but have parents or grandparents who are Nigerian, or are from a “combination of countries with broad genetic similarities to Nigerians”.The bigger question is, how much should we connect geography and identity anyway? An inidual’s “ethnicity” is largely based on their own perception of cultural and social traits, not which geopolitical borders they were born between. And there aren’t universal genetic traits within certain groups, Thomas points out.“Let’s be honest, these companies are using ethnicity as a nice, polished euphemism for race, and they’re trying to define biological races using this genetic data. That in itself is shifty,” he says. “If genetics has taught us one thing over 30 years or so, it’s that there are no clearcut biological racial categories. Everyone in the world is racialised in some way. But rather than overturning these outdated notions of race, these companies are servicing them instead – presumably because they get better profits.”When I ask the home-testing sites about linking the language of ethnicity to science, they offer varying responses. An AncestryDNA spokesperson told me that “analysing DNA to determine a person’s ethnic breakdown is at the cutting edge of science”, explaining that they have “thousands” of DNA samples from around the world. “Each is from a specific location and most are accompanied by a documented family tree indicating deep heritage in a particular region.” A 23andMe spokesperson tells me the company does “not refer to ethnicity” in its analysis, instead calling it an “ancestry composition”. Yaniv Erlich of MyHeritage says: “Ethnicity is not encoded in someone’s genes, but this human-made construct can be in correlation with genetic variations. We use this correlation to infer the ethnicity.”After I got over the initial shock of my own test results, I began to explore the rest of the MyHeritage site. I was amazed to find that I could contact a fourth cousin on my biological father’s side – my first black relative – and that she lived in the same city as me. We plan to meet up, and my quest to find out more about my biology continues.But I know that decoding my DNA is only one chapter of my history. Ancestry is a legacy, not a bloodline. Our genetic script may be one of the most valuable things we own, but it’s never the whole story."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61e64afec693a82058a268c1b6d12d0842e4d07c/0_340_5792_3474/master/5792.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e7b7ea3f04e787c2d06fa9940679399","title":"thomasina miers recipe for peach and raspberry trifle","story":"Combine custard, cream and fresh fruit for a fresher take on in this traditional puddingTrifle is a isive dish. Some people don’t like it at all(or at least the versions of it they have tried in the past) others are devotees. Some must have jelly in theirs others swear by candied peel and angelica on top. I know a handful of folk who insist on making the sponge themselves. For me, however, trifle is an excuse to make custard and to eat lots of summer fruit. Everything else is subjective. How do you like yours?This is a family-friendly, booze-free trifle, but I would always recommend sprinkling the sponge layer with a liqueur of your choice (a muscat would be delicious).4 peaches1 lemon3 tbsp honey200ml whole milk450ml double cream4 egg yolks2 tbsp caster sugar1 heaped tbsp cornflour1 tbsp icing sugar200g stale plain sponge or madeira cake, sliced thinly150g raspberries3 tbsp roasted hazelnuts, roughly choppedTo make the peach compote, chop three of the peaches into large chunks, then put in a saucepan. Shave two long strips of lemon peel from the lemon and add to the peaches, then zest the remainder of the peel into a mixing bowl and set aside for later.Squeeze two teaspoons of lemon juice on the peaches, then add the honey and 200ml water. Cook over a medium heat for eight to 10 minutes, until the peaches are soft and beginning to fall apart. Discard the lemon peel and put the peaches aside to cool.Next, make the custard. Put the milk and 150ml of the double cream in a pan, and warm to a simmer – but do not allow it to boil. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, cornflour and a splash of the milk mix into a smooth paste. When the milk mix comes to a simmer, whisk it into the egg paste. Return the mixture to the panover a medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until it has thickened– eight to 10 minutes. Pour into a bowl, cover with clingfilm touching the custard to prevent a skin forming, then put in the fridge to chill.Meanwhile, put the remaining cream in the bowl with the lemon zest and whisk with the icing sugar, until the cream is softly whipped but not too firm. You want itenough to be able to flop off a large spoon.When the compote and custard are cool, you can start assembling the trifle. Cut the remaining peach into bitesize pieces. Spoon the peach compote into a large, glass bowl and top with the sponge. Scatter with the chopped peach and half the raspberries. Spoon on the custard, followed by the cream to finish. Decorate the top with the remaining raspberries and sprinkle with the hazelnuts. If you are making this for children, I find a scattering of silver balls adds some real excitement (not to mention edible glitter). Chill for a few hours before serving.I make double the compote – it makes for a great breakfast with yoghurt. I also always make double the amount of custard– I can never resist a dollop here and there. Try it over fresh berries with some more toasted chopped nuts, or over jelly, for a very quick pudding."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/915309e25d30466756b7b1914e08ebf4c2736ba5/38_0_848_509/master/848.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46b034cc7833277bf932af07fa5fc899","title":"cottrell controversy reveals jekyll and hyde character of sky news","story":"A reliance on rightwing provocateurs is undermining the network’s reputation in AustraliaIn his smart suit, Blair Cottrell looked much the same as any of the other politicians, lobbyists and business figures who constantly roll in and out of Sky News’s Australian studios as fodder for its gruelling 24-hour news programming.But Cottrell’s interview on the cable news channel last Sunday about Australia’s immigration programme sparked a political firestorm that threatens to undermine the position of Rupert Murdoch’s network as a respected news organisation in his country of birth.Cottrell is a far-right extremist with a string of criminal convictions who has previously expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler and claimed to have manipulated women “using violence and terror”. He is also a vocal supporter of the British far-right activist Tommy Robinson. Last year Cottrell and two other men were convicted of inciting contempt and ridicule of Muslims after they made a video in which they beheaded a dummy with a toy sword outside a city council office.None of this, however, was made clear to viewers. Instead his interviewer, the former politician Adam Giles, gave Cottrell free rein to call for the reclamation of a “traditional Australian identity” by restricting immigration to people who are “culturally similar” to white Australians.He urged a ban on migrants from predominantly black African countries, saying Australia should limit its migrant intake to white South African farmers.The multinational financial firm American Express pulled its advertising, stating that “recent content on the channel does not reflect our brand values”. It was followed by Huggies nappies, Specsavers opticians and, on Friday, the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline.At the same time, a minister in Victoria announced she was banning the broadcasting of Sky at train stations throughout the state. A former federal government minister quit as a commentator for the channel, saying the decision to broadcast the Cottrell interview was “another step in a journey to normalising racism and bigotry in our country”.Sky’s position on Australian television screens has faced increasing scrutiny since it was wholly taken over by Murdoch’s News Corp in December 2016.Like its UK cousin, Sky is Australia’s major cable news network. Its daytime programming is predominantly dedicated to breaking news, and the network hosts a long list of high-profile and respected journalists.However, in Australia the channel has developed something of a Jekyll and Hyde character, becoming a dedicated home for provocateurs keen to make headlines in the crowded rightwing commentariat. Since the takeover there has been increasing talk of the “Foxification” of the network.“When the sun goes down at Sky, weird things come out to play,” the media academic Margaret Simons said.The Cottrell controversy followed an increasingly familiar pattern for the network.Last month David Leyonhjelm – a pro-gun, pro-free-market senator – caused outrage after he suggested to fellow politician Sarah Hanson-Young should “stop shagging men”.During a follow-up appearance on Sky he said said the senator was “known for liking men” and that “the rumours about her in Parliament House are well known”.Hanson-Young, a member of the leftwing Australian Greens, accused Leyonhjelm of “slut-shaming” her and has filed a defamation suit.In both the Cottrell and Leyonhjelm cases the network apologised, while its senior journalists strongly criticised the conduct.The Sky reporter Laura Jayes labelled Cottrell “a far-rightwing fascist”, while her colleague David Speers said it was wrong to have broadcast the interview.Despite the apologies, Sky hosts many conservative commentators who regularly push the line of decency.Its chief night-time ratings draw is Andrew Bolt, who last week wrote an article arguing that a “tidal wave” of migrants was swamping Australia, forming enclaves and “changing our culture”.Bolt regularly faces opprobrium for his views on immigration and Indigenous Australians. In 2011, he was found to have breached racial discrimination laws in two 2009 articles which implied light-skinned people who identified as Aboriginal did so for personal gain.And there are others. Last year Sky was forced to sack Mark Latham, a former Labor party leader turned rightwing outrage merchant, after he made a string of controversial statements, including speculating about the sexuality of a high school student. However the critic of what he has described as Australia’s “Muslim problem” still appears as a guest on several of the network’s programmes.Last week the race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, said racial fear was being monetised by “sections of a fracturing media industry” they were using racial controversies “as part of their business model” to grab attention and keep their audiences.Peter Fray, a former editor-in-chief of the Sydney Morning Herald and now a journalism academic, said the channel had seen a space in Australia’s media market for rightwing commentary.“I think what they’re tapping into is a relatively cheap strain of broadly rightwing commentary which has clearly gone too far with the Cottrell thing,” he said.“Is that monetising racism? It’s a good question. I think you could make that argument, but I don’t think it’s deliberate. I think what’s happening is they are giving some presenters a free rein to do what they do best, or worst, and you’re seeing that play out.”Simons, an associate professor in journalism at Monash University, is sceptical of how deliberate the strategy is at Sky.“There’s certainly a pattern of behaviour here but I don’t think we should conclude that it’s some kind of conspiracy where the News Corp heads are sitting back and planning the Blair Cottrell thing, because it has been incredibly damaging for them,” she said.“Frankly if they are doing it for that reason they’re failing because those programmes rate terribly.”According to the Australian ratings agency, Oztam, Bolt’s programme is watched by about 31,000 viewers. The figures for Outsiders – the programme on which Leyonhjelm appeared – rose from 17,000 in 2017 to 29,000 in the first half of 2018.By comparison, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s flagship nightly current affairs programme, 7.30, is viewed by about 600,000 people.But that could be about to change. This week Sky announced a partnership with the regional broadcaster Win. The deal will mean Sky’s daytime news – and night-time commentary – will have a potential audience of 8 million across Win’s network covering most of regional Australia.“It means people in those areas will get another competent national news service, but what impact the other Sky content will have on those regional markets we don’t know,” Simons said.But, she added: “I imagine it would be a boreathon for most people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9000cc885b49bbe85c156a02f299223b9a60bdd7/1114_108_3261_1957/master/3261.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b9ad8d8a5c186ea8c16859488c3558e","title":"uktv channels to return to virgin media","story":"Dave, Gold and other channels to reappear after companies reach agreementVirgin Media users will get back UKTV channels, including Dave and Gold, after the two companies reached an agreement, it has been announced.Customers lost all 23 of UKTV’s channels last month in a row over fees but the channels that were removed had already started to reappear, Virgin Media said on Saturday.David Bouchier, the firm’s chief digital entertainment officer, said: “Reaching this agreement reaffirms our longstanding partnership with UKTV and is fantastic news for our customers.“They can enjoy channels like Dave and Gold once again, including in HD, and also get more UKTV on-demand programming than ever before.” He said other channels that had been added to Virgin TV recently would remain. “We are sorry for what we know has been a frustrating time for our customers, but are pleased that our TV bundles are now even bigger.” Simon Michaelides, the chief commercial officer at UKTV, said: “Viewers are at the heart of UKTV and we want to thank them for all of their support. “We know this has created real disruption for some of our viewers and we’re so sorry for this, but we are thrilled to be back, broadcasting our channels and shows to customers of Virgin Media once more.”A statement to customers on UKTV’s Twitter page said thousands of viewers’ messages calling for the return of its channels to Virgin Media had been read and responded to. “We’re so sorry it’s taken both companies this long, and has caused disruption to so many people … "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2a83fa43e7c3e46fb20d833e6c58dd0bd56c063/0_244_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3f5f21497fa2c05de1877290e2ee844","title":"women long distance commuters mothers","story":"Nice, France, to London every week“I pinch myself every time I drive the kids to school on a Friday, when I see the glorious view of the Mediterranean sea from the school gate, before heading off on a hike in the mountains with the dog,” says Kate Simon. She lives in Nice, southern France, with her husband, Antoine, and their two primary school-aged children, and this was exactly the lifestyle they had in mind when they migrated from Buckinghamshire, eight years ago.To make their dream a reality, Kate had to commit to working Monday to Thursday in London, continuing with her senior marketing role.“I didn’t decide to be a long-distance commuter,” she says, “it was a byproduct of a move that was designed to provide a different lifestyle for us as a family. My husband and I had good jobs and a lovely life but we found ourselves asking: ‘Is this it?’ – commuting into\u0026nbspLondon, with the stress of rushing home at the end of the day to see the kids, aged four and two, before bedtime.”In France, Kate’s husband runs his holiday rentals and seasonal property management business mostly from home, so that he can look after the children when they are not at school. His mother also relocated to Nice, and helps with\u0026nbspchildcare.Knowing that her children are being raised by family rather than a nanny, are bilingual and have access to a wonderful life – skiing in winter, beach in summer – helps, but Kate still finds it hard being separated from them when she’s in London. “If the kids are ill or there’s a family emergency, the distance feels very real,” she says.However, she earns significantly more than she would if she worked locally, and it still makes financial sense to work this way, even with the additional overheads of their flat\u0026nbspin London.“The cost of living is higher in France,” Kate says. “But the commuting costs are actually cheaper now. I spend less per week doing a round trip from Nice to Gatwick than it used to cost to take the train from Leighton Buzzard to Euston every day, with car parking.” She says, however, that the family has been hit by the post-Brexit exchange rate, which is costing her several hundred pounds a month, as\u0026nbspshe is paid in pounds, while home expenditure is in euros.What she finds most infuriating about her work-life arrangement, though, is judgment from others. “There have been a range of comments from outright sexism to veiled horror that a woman could be doing something as outrageous as being away from her children during the week,” she says.But she is pleased she is doing her bit for feminism. “I know we’re in the minority in terms of role reversal, but for us this is a benefit. I like to think that we’re showing our son and daughter that mums can be career-oriented and professionally successful, and dads can be caregivers and homemakers. Life choices should not be defined by\u0026nbspgender.”The TUC believe the increase is down to people being priced out by unaffordable housing, and an inefficient transport system. But it seems the promise of a more wholesome, outdoors lifestyle – alongside a London income – is also a draw for some.Belfast to LondonKatie Scott and her husband, Jonny, left London for Northern Ireland, with their baby, in search of fresh air, green space and to be closer to Jonny’s parents. They rented out their two-bed flat in Brixton and now\u0026nbsplive in a lovely cottage surrounded by woodland, a river and fields.Initially Katie was working for Cancer Research UK in Belfast, commuting for an hour and a half each way, five days a week – with trips to London twice a month. But on returning after having their second baby, she was promoted to a role that involved travelling two-three days a week to the head office in Angel, north London.“I do the five-hour each way commute because it keeps me working for a large national charity,” she says. “The job market in Northern Ireland is completely different and charity jobs aren’t well\u0026nbsppaid, so I get the benefit of a London salary and much lower living costs.”Katie tries to condense her working days in London to avoid commuting back and forth in a day, and travel expenses are covered by her employer, so she is no worse off\u0026nbspfinancially.She stays with a friend or family member for two nights a week, which also enables her to catch up with her own family, who are mostly based in London. Once she is back in Northern Ireland, working from home, she is around for her children, making it to parent-teacher meetings or sports day, and doing the school drop-off and collection.“Seeing the kids running out in the garden or on the beach – 30\u0026nbspminutes away – makes all the travel worthwhile,” she says.Glasgow to LondonMay Rosenthal began a long-distance commute for different reasons. She lives in Glasgow, where\u0026nbspshe studied at university and has lived ever since, and gets the four-and-a-half-hour train to London early on Monday morning, returning home to her partner and\u0026nbspfour-year-old son late on a Thursday evening.Rather than craving a more idyllic\u0026nbsplifestyle, it was a dream job offer, as a researcher for the Victoria\u0026nbspand Albert Museum, that lured May back to London, where she grew up, to live and work part of\u0026nbspthe week.She worries about the impact of her choices on the rest of the family. “I’ve been doing the commute for a year and a half, and it now feels like we have a really good rhythm and balance but early on it was tough on\u0026nbspour son who got quite upset about it. And for my partner, it has definitely added pressure – in terms of having to deal with both the practical and emotional aspects of\u0026nbspraising our son.“We FaceTime twice a day, which really helps, but even that requires extra organisation from my partner, making sure there’s time to do it before and after nursery.”Financially it’s difficult but that’s more to do with working in a low-paid sector, says May. The weekly return train costs about £100, depending on times and how far in advance she books it. This eats into\u0026nbspher salary, but lower living costs\u0026nbspin Glasgow means they can make it work.“I couldn’t afford to do this job while living in London and paying for childcare,” she says.The family live in a large flat, with easy access to parks, museums and galleries, and when in London, May stays with her dad and his partner, paying a contribution to the household but “not on a proper London rent level”.An advantage to working this way is being able to concentrate fully on work while in London and on the train journey back to Glasgow – and then, aside from Fridays when she’s working from home, “it’s very much family time”, she says.“I’m proud that we are setting an\u0026nbspexample for our son of women doing fulfilling work, and of men having really strong caring roles. I think our set-up is building his resilience and adaptability and has been amazing for the relationship between my partner and our son.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87bf10820d38fd738257e44d762852d9cabcbc9b/0_23_6614_3969/master/6614.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2c356d7c769933f43bb723c685711d4","title":"britney spears making baby one more time","story":"As the smash hit that changed the musical landscape turns 20, Britney, along with her collaborators, discuss the creation of a pop masterpieceDUN DUN DUN. “Oh baby, baby ... ”. In just three seconds ...Baby One More Time, which turns 20 this year, announced the arrival of a new superstar: the then 16-year-old ex-Mouseketeer from Kentwood, Louisiana, Britney Jean Spears. Along with its equally iconic high school-set music video it re-turfed pop, kickstarting an entire sound (think funk-tinged R\u0026ampB grooves mixed with Abba melodies), sweeping aside the dregs of grunge (sorry, Bush) and US heartland rock (bye, Hootie \u0026amp the Blowfish), revitalising pop radio and MTV in the process, before cementing its songwriter and co-producer Max Martin as one of modern music’s most influential exponents. In the space of just three minutes and 31 seconds, Spears launched millennial teen pop, fusing family-friendly, girl-next-door fun with good old fashioned controversy, forging a template for those who followed.While TLC interpreted the lyrics as alluding to domestic violence, they actually represented Martin’s attempts at American slang, believing “hit me” could seamlessly replace “call me”. The song was then offered to fellow Swede, Robyn, whom Martin had already worked with on two US top 10 singles (Do You Know (What It Takes) and Show Me Love, both released in 1997), but again nothing came of it. According to Tim Bower’s 2012 book, Sweet Revenge: The Intimate Life of Simon Cowell, the song had one further dalliance with a pop act other than Britney. The story goes that after hearing Martin’s demo of what had now been renamed …Baby One More Time, Cowell demanded he have the song for his latest boyband, UK rabble Five. Martin had already co-written Five’s debut single, Slam Dunk (Da Funk) alongside his mentor, the late Denniz Pop, but declined Cowell’s request, saying it had already been earmarked for Spears. “You’re mad,” Cowell is reported to have said. “No one can be successful with a name like that.” As a last gasp attempt, Cowell offered Martin a new Merc 500SL in return for the song. “It costs £95,000,” he added.It was …Baby One More Time that convinced Spears of the merits of pop. She initially saw herself as making “Sheryl Crow music, but younger”, while Larry Rudolph, an entertainment lawyer friend of Spears’s mum Lynne who had been tasked with getting her signed (he’s now her manager), had her record a clutch of songs originally recorded by Toni Braxton. It was those recordings that lead to auditions for Mercury, Epic and Jive (the first two labels said no she signed with the latter) which included Spears covering Whitney Houston’s version of I Will Always Love You. With the more R\u0026ampB-leaning early material not working, and with a clause allowing Jive to terminate her contract after 90 days if they felt an album wasn’t on the horizon, A\u0026ampR Steve Lunt approached Martin, who had already delivered success for Jive’s boyband the Backstreet Boys. A meeting was set up with Spears in New York. “I was pretty young at the time, so I was nervous,” she says, “but he was so nice and put me right at ease.” For Martin, his song had finally found its home.From New York, Spears de-camped to Martin’s Cheiron studios in Stockholm to start recording. “I remember being so in awe of Stockholm,” Spears says. “I was out there for, like, 10 days, but we were so busy in the studio I didn’t have time to go out and explore on that first trip.” The song’s co-producer Rami Yacoub remembers Spears as “very shy and super sweet – I mean she was a kid and we had no idea there was a beast of an artist lurking under that innocent look”. The sessions were intense, with four of the album’s five singles recorded in that time. In 2001, Martin referred to the Cheiron sound as “direct, effective, we don’t show off”, words reiterated by Yacoub. “A song that sounds simple is not simple to make. It’s all about the taste and making sure you don’t add more than what the song needs.”For Spears, working with perfectionists suited her. “I really respect that when I’m working with him,” she says. “I think Max is a genius. It all just came together and felt right. In my opinion Max is the greatest songwriter of all time.”Another person to witness firsthand this studied effortlessness was Nana Hedin, a backing vocalist who had previously worked with Denniz Pop on songs by Dr Alban, whose 1992 hit It’s My Life soundtracked a Tampax advert in the UK. Pop recommended Hedin to Martin, who brought her onboard for …Baby One More Time. “I remember I thought the song was for teenagers but the production was filled with a grown-up attitude and sounds that I really liked,” she says. “I was so impressed by how a guy like Max could write lyrics that got into the hearts and spoke to the teenage thinking.” Occasionally, Hedin would record her backing vocals first, before the artist arrived, but with …Baby One More Time Spears’s vocals were already recorded. “I tried to sound exactly like her,” she laughs. “It was hard, but a lot of fun. I’m like a parrot in many ways. I try to get the same vibe and use the exact same pronunciation as the artist. In one harmony, each take is different I sing very high, in another I use powerful belting, the next I’m whispering and sometimes I even pinch my nose for a sharper sound.”With Britney’s vocals recorded in March, and the song finished shortly after (“It took probably around two to three weeks to finish,” says Yacoub), Spears headed out on a summer tour, taking in 26 shopping malls. Aware that they had a potential hit on their hands, Jive sent reps out to meet with the influential US radio programme directors ahead of the song’s October release. “The label guy brought in a video featuring Britney rehearsing dance moves to the song,” remembers Clarke Ingram, then operations manager and program director of New York’s Top 40 radio station WPXY. “This had the desired effect of showing me that Britney had star quality, in addition to having a potential hit record. We went to lunch afterwards, and I committed to adding the song at that time.” In fact, Ingram is pretty sure he was the first person to play the song on US radio. “No other station would have heard it any earlier, and I know of no station that played it before we did.” For Ingram, …Baby One More Time represented the holy grail: a song pop radio could fully own. “We’d been through an alternative cycle in the early to mid-90s, and something of an R\u0026ampB cycle after that,” he explains. “Britney was among the first big artists in a pop cycle that began in the late 1990s and continued into the early 2000s. The song hit the centre of the Top 40 audience, and it proved that by its performance, both on the air and off.”The song sold 500,000 copies on its first day of release in the US, eventually peaking at No 1. It reached No 1 in every single country it charted in, and was 1999’s biggest-selling song in the UK with 1.4m copies sold. A megastar had been created seemingly overnight. “I don’t think we understood what we had done,” Martin said in a 2008 Swedish radio documentary. “I remember sitting in the studio when they called me to let me know that my song had made No 1 in the USA … I had so much going on I didn’t really grasp the meaning of it”. He even forgot to tell Yacoub. “Max walked into the studio one day while I was working and said: ‘Hey man, by the way, we are No 1 in America,’” he recalls. “I asked him when it had happened and he said: ‘Three weeks ago.’ We really didn’t focus on charts, we just kept working.” Even celebrations were muted. “It was on a Tuesday, I believe: an early dinner, a cigar, and to bed at 11pm as we had work the next day.”An iconic song needed an iconic video. Unfortunately, director Nigel Dick’s original concept was deemed a dud by Spears. “I wrote an idea which sucked, so the label put me back on the phone with Britney who told me she wanted to make a video where she was stuck in a classroom thinking about boys and we took it from there,” Dick writes on the harangued-sounding FAQ section of his website. He also states the school uniform look, augmented by plaited bunches and bare midriff, was Spears’s idea too. What seems relatively tame now caused uproar in a bubblegum pop era that, via shows like MTV’s popular Total Request Live, was being fed directly into family homes.The video, an instant pop culture moment that gave Spears all-important tabloid notoriety, also fused in the public consciousness with David LaChapelle’s controversial 1999 Rolling Stone cover shoot featuring Spears lying on her childhood bed in her underwear clutching a Teletubby. Suddenly, the now turbo-charged teen pop genre had its flag bearer, one whose identity – sweet southern belle in the video for soft-focus follow-up single Sometimes red PVC-clad dominatrix in the “not that innocent” Oops!…I Did It Again visual – was malleable enough to, at least initially, be everything all at once. How does Spears feel about the song almost 20 years later? “Wow, that went quick.

They amount to a removal of every single one of Theresa May’s negotiating red lines, because we will be making ongoing payments to the EU, still be bound by its rules, and reintroducing free movement by another name.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9073359949007adada1c8a594a68cad365f789cf/34_277_4694_2817/master/4694.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce755ffa8a7952a79b25783c9b9a6420","title":"come out of hiding jewish leader marie van der zyl tells jeremy corbyn","story":"Unison’s Dave Prentis argues that not doing so is costing party the moral high groundDave Prentis, the Unison general secretary, has become the second major union boss in two days to call for Labour to adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition on antisemitism, arguing that not doing so is costing the party the moral high ground to oppose racial hatred and oppression.Prentis said the row had become a dangerous distraction for Labour and made it easy for supporters of Boris Johnson to wave away criticism of the former foreign secretary’s controversial remarks about fully veiled Muslim women “by saying ‘what about antisemitism in the Labour party?’”He said the issue was already costing Labour votes, “as I saw for myself when campaigning in Barnet” in local elections this year. “Worse than that, it’s harming Labour’s historically close relationship with the Jewish community. And it’s costing us the moral high ground from which to oppose all forms of racial hatred and oppression.”It comes a day after the GMB leader, Tim Roache, made the same argument, complaining that party members were “knocking lumps out of each other” when it should be exploiting Tory isions. “It is abundantly clear that Labour has to accept IHRA examples of antisemitism in full, while agreeing that criticising the Israeli government and supporting our Palestinian brothers and sisters is not being antisemitic,” Roache wrote.Labour has proposed to adopt the IHRA code while only including seven out of its 11 example definitions, prompting an intense row with the majority of the Jewish community inside and outside of the party. Although there have been hints that Labour is ready to yield on three of the four missing definitions, an impasse remains over a fourth – “claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavour” – because of concerns about hindering legitimate criticism of Israel’s creation.Responding to that, Prentis said: “Of course, in this debate, there is always an elephant in the room – the oft-repeated assertion that you can’t criticise Israel without being accused of antisemitism. I hear it a lot, but I’m not buying it.“I’m not buying it as a regular critic of the Israeli government, settlements, expansionism and the blockade of Gaza.” Meanwhile, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews has accused Jeremy Corbyn of hiding from the antisemitism crisis engulfing the Labour party and called on him to “come out of hiding” and face up to the issue.Marie van der Zyl said Corbyn had “seemingly disappeared” since last weekend, when he released a video and comment pieces, as she repeated a call for Labour to embrace the IHRA definition of antisemitism in full.“He is in hiding from the media and refuses to face the obvious difficult questions. He is clearly just hoping it will go away. I’ve got some bad news for him. Unless he does what he needs to do, it won’t,” Van der Zyl wrote in an article for Jewish News.Corbyn condemned antisemitism last weekend, writing that it was “Labour’s responsibility to root out antisemitism in our party” in a piece published by the .But despite the speculation that the party might move to adopt three of the four outstanding examples, Labour’s formal position has not changed. Corbyn is on holiday and was pictured at Lion Rock Tea Rooms in Cheddar, Somerset.Van der Zyl said Corbyn needed to resolve the issueand Labour should adopt all 11 examples in the IHRA code and open up the party’s disciplinary process to independent scrutiny, while Corbyn should acknowledge “the problematic nature of his own past actions”.“You cannot lead through invisibility,” Van der Zyl concluded. “I call on Jeremy Corbyn to come out of hiding and do the right thing. Surely, by now, enough is enough.”A Labour spokesperson said: “Jeremy Corbyn is a militant opponent of antisemitism, fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community. “Jeremy has made clear in interviews, articles, statements and videos over the last few months that antisemitism has no place in our party or wider society, he is determined to eradicate it in all its forms and to rebuildtrust with the Jewish community.”The former Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy also criticised Corbyn’s handling of the crisis. He took out a full-page advert in the Glasgow edition of the Jewish  to accuse the party’s leadership of being “intellectually arrogant, emotionally inept and politically maladroit”.Murphy called on Labour to adopt the IHRA code, with all its examples, and said it was the first time he had criticised Corbyn since he stepped down as an MP in 2015.“He is the elected leader and, along with the shadow cabinet, has the opportunity to shape party policy,” Murphy said. “But no party leader has the right to shatter the relationship between Labour and British Jewry.“Instead, what’s needed urgently is Labour action against the sickening anti-Jewish racism that is the actual cause of the offence in the first place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1e900aa0722215e086422a228b901b92c009f80/0_1_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49435e036dcae4ecd398a500475149d2","title":"tented britain rise in rough sleepers taking shelter under canvas","story":"UK may not have tent cities like US, but encampments have become feature of British lifeSun-bleached food packaging and the fading remnants of a campfire are the only clues that people used to live in woodland near Cardiff Bay. Residents nearby said the homeless men living in Hamadryad Park had left shortly after Aaron French-Willcox, 19, was found cold and unresponsive in a tent at an encampment in the early hours of 13 February.French-Wilcox, who had type one diabetes and died from diabetic ketoacidosis, started living in one of the three tents at the site after he was reportedly caught taking the synthetic cannabinoid spice at a homeless shelter three weeks before his death. “He didn’t belong out here,” said a Cardiff rough sleeper who knew him. “He was a nice guy. Goodhearted. Just a decent 19-year-old.” The teenager was one of a growing number of homeless people in temporary and semi-permanent encampments throughout the UK, in what has become an increasingly common fixture of British life, living underneath bridges, clearings in woodland and quieter corners of city centres. The official rough sleeper count in England – widely considered a big underestimate – has strict rules about what constitutes a rough sleeper. People living in encampments are not necessarily included in the 4,751 people who bedded down outside overnight in 2017. The government is expected to release its strategy for tackling street homelessness within the next few days. The strategy aims to halve rough sleeping by 2021 and eliminate it by 2027.In the past year, encampments of varying sizes have been reported in cities and towns including Bristol, Milton Keynes, Cardiff, Manchester, Oxford, Sheffield, London, Northampton, Cambridge, Stoke-on-Trent, Leeds, Glasgow and Exeter.Police and councils are often quick to try to break up encampments and move people on using enforcement orders and public space protection orders (PSPOs).In the centre of Slough, eight homeless people camping outside a Catholic church have been issued with a notice to vacate by the local diocese. A church volunteer told local media that members of the congregation had complained about the encampment and said the group were “intimidating”.Last month, 10 police officers broke up a camp on the banks of the Severn near Worcester Cathedral where about half a dozen rough sleepers had been living. Days later, former camp members were reportedly seen sleeping rough in the city centre. Homeless encampments are also entering popular culture. For the first time in the soap’s 57-year history, Coronation Street is running a storyline on homelessness in which the longtime character Sean Tully experiences cashflow problems and ends up living at a homeless camp underneath railway arches. Matt Downie, the director of policy at Crisis, said: “People living in tents and cars and squats and various different forms of homelessness should just be viewed as part of the homeless population. To a large extent, the problem should be viewed as simply another form of rough sleeping.“It’s true that it’s an underrepresented group. We are pretty confident that the numbers of people experiencing those forms of homelessness aren’t picked up, particularly in the rough sleeping statistics.”Downie said a future in which US-style tent cities become a normal part of life in the UK would be “unimaginable”, but warned that more and more people would be forced to live on the streets and in encampments unless government policy changed.Last summer, Milton Keynes hit the headlines when more than 60 tents were pitched in underpasses and on the streets, many inhabited by low-wage workers, former soldiers and people with mental health issues. Milton Keynes council said it has since had success in housing the town’s rough sleepers. It said the number had fallen to just under 50, with 14 tents still standing in July. The council credited a partnership between homelessness organisations, police and other services to help house people, using charities with existing links to rough sleepers to get people into emergency accommodation. Peter Marland, the leader of the council, said higher rents and government cuts were the main drivers of the encampments. “A lot of this is to do with service cuts, whether that be the NHS, the police, some council services, those support services that were previously there if you had a drug or alcohol addiction,” he said.“With austerity, we’ve seen a lot of those services go away because homelessness had seemed to go away, but obviously what a lot of those support services were doing is keeping people away from being homeless.”At the start of the year, the Labour council launched a housing first scheme, which offers rough sleepers long-term secure accommodation alongside support services, which Marland said had helped get more than 50 people off the street. “Milton Keynes in a way is different. We’ve overtaken Liverpool and Sheffield in terms of our economy size. In becoming a big city, it means you get big city problems,” he said.“Quite early, we ruled out PSPOs. We didn’t want to criminalise the act of being homeless. Nobody wakes up in the morning and says: ‘I’m going to live in a tent.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/573503fad2eebaf011df0ae99a3e2be49c1e7cfc/0_179_3688_2212/master/3688.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e8dd44db73281bc0d63e597792e5371","title":"gary woodland us pga second round","story":"Thunder and lightning disrupted play on day two of the final major but home golfers were firmly in control in the clubhousePerhaps it is appropriate that the 100th playing of this major sees the US firmly in control of the US PGA. On a Friday where Bellerive was virtually defenceless, those carrying the stars and stripes marched to positions of prominence.Chief among them was Gary Woodland, whose second-round 66 meant the equalling of a 36-hole major scoring record at 130. It is hardly being disrespectful to suggest that Nick Faldo, the first to achieve that number, encountered a tougher backdrop at Muirfield in 1992.Bellerive is in Missouri and Woodland, who hails from the next door state of Kansas, would be a highly popular winner of the Wanamaker Trophy on Sunday evening. He would also be a shock one since a share of 12th in this event in 2011, Woodland has gone 42nd, 74th, missed cut, did not play, missed cut and tied 22nd. What is the opposite of horses for courses?“I have a lot of friends out here,” Woodland said. “A lot of college teammates, a lot of people from college. My parents are here. My sister’s here. My wife and my little guy are here as well. It’s pretty special to be close to home where everybody can come out and watch because I have a lot of family who have never seen me play in person.”Kevin Kisner, playing in Woodland’s company, was not of a mind to let the big-hitter have it all his own way. Kisner’s 64 moved him to nine under par and only one off the lead.If the appearance of this duo at the leaderboard’s summit is something of a surprise, the same cannot be said for two of the men in closest pursuit. Golf’s cavalry – American of course – lurk with menacing intent.Brooks Koepka was two over par after six holes of his first round recovery from there has seen the US Open champion sign for a 69 and 63 to move to minus eight. One adrift of Koepka is Dustin Johnson, the world No 1, following Friday’s 66. “I’m definitely wanting to get that second major win,” said Johnson, in what marks as close to a war cry as he will ever utter.Fowler had tied Johnson’s score before the arrival of an epic storm that led to the suspension of the second round until Saturday. Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy were among those hauled from the course as the heavens opened and thunder cracked. August and the midwest always looked an ominous combination.Those of foreign persuasion have not entirely given up hope. Charl Schwartzel’s 63 was sufficient to send him to seven under and Thomas Pieters matched that aggregate after his 66, a welcome return to form for the Belgian, who has rather lost his way after a starring role in the 2016 Ryder Cup. Adam Scott’s 65 puts him at five under, alongside the Open champion, Francesco Molinari, and Jon Rahm. Credit is due to Rahm for saving par at the 17th after he was handed an unfortunate penalty for accidentally standing on his ball in the rough. Rahm is not known, after all, for taking such moments of adversity especially well.The Friday exodus included Sergio Garcia, Alex Noren and Paul Casey, as all pertinent exits with Europe’s present Ryder Cup scenario in mind. Bubba Watson’s second round of 78 meant he, too, crashed out after 36 holes. There was better news for Tommy Fleetwood, who birdied his last two holes to secure a weekend berth. That means prize money given the aberration of midweek, when his Open winnings were mistakenly paid into the bank account of one Thomas Fleetwood of Florida, his namesake might be in for another windfall.Jordan Spieth’s chances of completing a career grand slam here remain odds against, despite scoring improvement on day two. The Texan added a 66 to his first round 71, thereafter admitting his exasperation with the course layout in St Louis, giving the distinct impression he does not regard this tournament as having a major feel.“I’m a little frustrated at this place in general,” said Spieth. “I think that it’s tough to come to a venue with bent grass greens and this kind of weather. This course would be phenomenal ... if it’s not playing so soft. And it’s not the rain that came on Tuesday, it was like that on Monday. So you just fire in and you get away with more, like you don’t have to be as precise. That’s frustrating in a major championship. That’s frustrating to me because I feel like that’s an advantage that I have.“So personally I would prefer more difficult and firmer, faster conditions on the greens. Having said that, I would have shot a much higher score yesterday, given you’ve got to be in the fairways in order to hold greens where they need to be. So I’m not saying that my score would be any better, I’m just saying what you would like to see in a major championship. I really like the golf course ..., you just can’t ... have firm, fast bent grass greens with this climate.” Spieth, needless to say, is an advocate of the US PGA’s switch to May from next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf60a5fbcc1a1fd8fc48eda6b1bb7d81333f6167/0_338_1329_797/master/1329.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7c79bb5d4fda7c381a59cc340e69490","title":"nine year old chess prodigy told he can stay in uk shreyas royal home office reverse","story":"A nine-year-old chess prodigy has been told he does not have to leave the UK when his father’s work visa expires, a move that has been welcomed by MPs and chess organisations in Britain.Shreyas Royal has lived in the UK since he was three but was told he would be sent back to India when the work visa expires in September.On Friday, his father, Jitendra Singh, said he had received an email that morning, informing him of the Home Office’s change of mind.“They just emailed me and told me they had considered my case and we are allowed to extend our leave to remain on tier 2 general route,” Singh said.“We are very happy and Shreyas is very happy. He jumped up on the sofa when he heard the news. I want to thank all those who helped and supported us ... I would also like to thank the Home Office and the home secretary who considered our case.” The news was also welcomed by the English Chess Federation, which has been campaigning for the boy to remain. Dominic Lawson, the ECF president, said: “We ... are delighted that our efforts to persuade the government to recognise Shreyas Royal’s exceptional talents have borne fruit.”Lawson’s words were echoed by Leon Watson, the secretary at Battersea Chess Club, where Shreyas is a member. “This is an enormous relief.” he said. “Shreyas is a very nice, down-to-earth young man who has a big future ahead of him.”Shreyas, nicknamed Shrez, was described by Chris Ward, a chess grandmaster and former British champion, as “the best prospect the country has ever seen”.He started playing chess at six, eventually becoming the world’s youngest “candidate master”. In August 2017 he was ranked joint fourth in his age group at the World Cadets Chess Championships in Brazil. In his short time playing he has won multiple awards.Shreyas’s parents, Jitendra and Anju Singh, moved to south-east London from India in 2012. They have been staying under a tier 2 long-term work permit, but were recently told that the only way they could stay would be for Jitendra Singh to renew his visa. To do so he had to earn more than £120,000 a year.The couple appealed to the Home Office on the grounds thattheir son was a national asset, but received a letter earlier in the month saying that while he showed “immense promise” it did not mean he could remain in the country.The decision was originally challenged by MPs who urged the Home Office to reconsider. Labour’s Rachel Reeves, a former junior chess champion, and Matthew Pennycook, MP for Greenwich and Woolwich where Shreyas lives, wrote to two cabinet ministers urging them to let the boy stay.The email received by Singh on Friday read: “As advised during the call we have spoken to your employer ... and have agreed with them that you will be able to submit an application to extend your stay in the UK under the tier 2 (General) route.“I would be grateful if you could let me know once the applications have been submitted so that I can ensure that they are processed smoothly.”The Home Office has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9078b82a82fd39fb3131d08e31a5dd654fbee1d/0_62_3260_1955/master/3260.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a839ddd15d894b857547cd7b36cb79d","title":"wigan castleford super league match report","story":"Wigan, with their coaching team for next year and beyond watching on, took a significant step towards a home semi-final in the Super League play-offs by beating third-placed Castleford.Both Adrian Lam, who will be Wigan’s coach next season, and Shaun Edwards, who will return from rugby union in 2020 to take charge at the DW Stadium, were present to watch Shaun Wane’s side reinforce second spot.A dominant first-half display laid the platform for victory for the hosts, who had opened up a 20-point lead by half-time against a remarkably out-of-sorts Castleford side. And though the visitors fought back well after the break, the damage had already been done.In an opening quarter of complete dominance tries for Liam Marshall and Gabriel Hamlin were no less than Wigan’s endeavours merited. Castleford struggled to retain possession amid an error-strewn display.It was fitting that Castleford’s first foray into opposition territory after 20 minutes produced a knock-on which led to Wigan extending their lead. After George Williams forced Castleford to drop out, the stand-off provided the final pass in the play that allowed Dan Sarginson to stride through unchallenged and make it 14-0.The only blot on Wigan’s first-half performance was an injury to Sam Tomkins but his replacement, the French full-back Morgan Escaré, was involved in the play that helped the hosts underline their superiority. Ryan Sutton crashed over following yet another error from Castleford to make it 20-0, a scoreline few could argue with given the balance of play.Castleford reduced the deficit with a fine Jake Trueman try before James Clare claimed Jamie Ellis’ well-weighted kick just after Escaré had nudged Wigan’s lead out further with a penalty.That made it 22-10, before Paul McShane threatened a grandstand finish after touching down another Ellis kick to reduce the gap to six with Castleford’s third try. Though Mitch Clark crossed for the visitors on the hooter, a penalty from the boot of the returning Tomkins proved to be the difference and ensure the hosts held on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c99c539071fe84c3ba44df2857ae50fd89c1e38/0_321_5656_3393/master/5656.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f707ae80bf763b33958f8fcaa603af1","title":"toronto wolfpack super league qualifiers","story":"After 18 relatively trouble-free months the biggest challenge in Toronto Wolfpack’s short history begins this weekend. Rugby league’s transatlantic trailblazers have made light work of the professional game so far since their inaugural game in February 2017 winning League One at a canter last season, before finishing top of the sport’s second tier, the Championship, this time around.In any other sport a record of 21 wins from 23 games would be enough to ensure promotion but Toronto now head into the Qualifiers, the eight-team mini-league featuring Super League’s bottom four and the Championship’s leading quartet which will determine the final four places in the top flight in 2019.The top three teams after seven games automatically gain Super League status fourth and fifth play-off in the Million Pound Game for the 12th and final spot. For Toronto, that all begins this Sunday with a trip to Halifax. Martin Vickers, head of the Wolfpack’s UK operations, says: “The club is hugely excited about the next seven weeks and the chance to play some top clubs.”With the disparity in funding between the top two isions, being in Super League next season is seen as vital by some clubs but the Wolfpack, who are fortunate enough to be bankrolled by the Australian mining tycoon David Argyle, do not share that view, unsurprisingly. Vickers says: “The goal from the outset was Super League and we would love to achieve that sooner rather than later, but I wouldn’t describe being in the Championship next year as fatal. We have long-term partnerships which continue to thrive, we are collaborating strongly with local communities to get children playing rugby and we have a serious and sustainable long-term model.”The reaction in Toronto to rugby league, from schools through to match-day attendances, has been positive – and offers an insight into the potential the sport perhaps has in cracking North America. More than 8,200 fans watched their recent game against Featherstone and Vickers believes that is simply the tip of the iceberg for the years ahead.“From day one the response from the Canadian fans has been awesome,” he says. “It’s a breath of fresh air for the sport to see a huge city like Toronto embrace the game. It’s also great to see the amount of UK supporters coming to games, and the tourism board in Toronto recognise the economic impact the club is bringing to the city.”With Argyle’s backing, Toronto have not been coy in flexing their financial muscle. Established NRL players such as Darcy Lussick and Chase Stanley have arrived in Canada this year – but even with such investment promotion at this stage would be ahead of where the Wolfpack’s projected seven-year plan had them in 2019. Vickers says: “I’m fairly sure when our investment group sat down just over two years ago and put this project together, this point felt like a long time away. But it’s a great credit to everyone involved that the club has an opportunity to create history over the next few crucial weeks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0561ec06b2e102b1756f6152c1b087e26529b1b9/145_102_5214_3127/master/5214.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42cb28863e675d8bbd3e70910c05cd55","title":"england v india second test day three live","story":"Pope, the 687th English Test cricketer. Improbably, the first Oliver.We should get our first glimpse of Oliver Pope at the crease for England today. Familiarise yourself with England’s latest debutant here.Andy Bull completed ’s four-man attack at Lord’s yesterday and his takeaway was all about India’s reliance on Virat Kohli.  Kohli has been involved in five run-outs in Test cricket but has been dismissed only once. He is not a man who gives up his wicket for the sake of a teammate. In the end it turned out that Kohli’s decision bought India only another handful of runs. But it all added to this impression that Kohli is a captain who seems to think that, if a thing has to be done, he had best do it himself. Which seems to mean that, if he does not, it does not get done at all. Brilliant as he is, it feels as if India have invested too much power, and too much hope, in just one man.Barney Ronay was also at Lord’s yesterday and he marvelled at the performance of the ageless Anderson.  It has become a habit to wonder idly how long Anderson can keep on doing this. But why stop at all? His method is so settled, his action so easy, his management by England so sympathetic, the results are increasingly remarkable.Ali Martin was in the bowels of Lord’s yesterday to hear from the man of the hour, James Anderson. They were the ideal conditions. It’s so much fun when it’s like that. You don’t often get conditions like that in England any more, when the ball does that much through the air and off the pitch.Vic Marks was in the shiny Lord’s media pod yesterday to witness England take a stranglehold on this match and possibly the series. It was an idyllic day for England with little play but lots of progress. Seldom have they made such significant inroads with such minimal effort. Despite the regular intrusions of heavy showers England took a stranglehold on the game after putting India in to bat. For everyone else – and the Indian side in particular – it was a day of torment, for the spectators so frequently sheltering under the stands or the batsmen surrendering their wickets against the devious Duke ball.Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of day three of the second Test between England and India from Lord’s.Let’s cut to the chase: it’s not raining! Even better, it’s forecast to remain dry for the entire day. This means that once play gets underway at 11am we should be able to pack in something close to the scheduled 98 overs. Who knows what might happen in that length of time? Yesterday India only withstood 35.2 overs of England’s swing and seam masterclass, the second-shortest first-innings at the home of cricket in 100 years. However, conditions today should be more in the batting side’s favour, and India don’t have James Anderson among their attack.Friday was all about Anderson. The premier swing bowler of his generation was handed perfect conditions (and perfect opponents) to showcase his craft. The Lancastrian didn’t disappoint bagging 5-20, the 26th five-for of his Test career, his sixth appearance on the honours board at Lord’s, and a haul that took him to a record 99 Test wickets at the venerable old ground. If yesterday belonged to the veteran Anderson, today could be a chance for the debutant Oliver Pope to shine. Scheduled to come in at number four we should see the Surrey prodigy mark his first guard in Test cricket at some point. England have shown catholic taste in their search for top order batsmen and they will be praying they have found a Pope they can put their faith in. (Unfortunately I’m sure these will not be the last pontiff puns of the day, or Mr Pope’s career.)As always, please feel free to join in the conversation.

This page will be updated daily throughout the festivalA delight in doodling is at the heart of this inventive escapade for the over-threes from Korean company Brush Theatre. Our mischievous hosts, Youngkyun Yeom and Seungeun Lee, are wearing matching costumes – white T-shirts, black trousers and braces – and armed with marker pens and big imaginations. First, the duo invite us to sketch pictures of them on mini whiteboards, then they draw our portraits and we become characters in their show. Before long, they are animating their scribbles and smudges on a huge screen to create a nautical adventure. There’s a twinkle in both performances and in the jaunty keyboard accompaniment, too. CWWriter and performer Katherina Radeva lives between two places: the Bulgaria of her birth and the Britain she has called home for years. In Fallen Fruit, she journeys back there and then to the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, in the dying days of communist power. The show weaves together Radeva’s childhood recollections of 1989 with her parents’ memories, the story of two family friends and the complex upheavals that rippled through the continent that year. CLRead the full three-star reviewA kids’ show that captures the magic of cookery with cracking eggs, a shower of flour through a sieve and the irresistible smell of a cake baked on stage. This tale of mice planning a birthday celebration under the nose of a watchful cat is framed by the storyteller’s own preparations for her daughter’s 16th, and her memories of family birthdays give the show a lovely, wistful air. Danyah Miller quickly establishes a rapport with the young audience, inviting plenty of participation. If the puppets by Little Angel don’t have the wow factor of some of their other creations, they are appealing in their ingenuity, not least the colander cat. CWThe future Gary McNair imagines is a raggedy one, worn down and patched up with dodgy stitches. In 2042, when the NHS has long been dismantled and patients are charged for doctor’s appointments by the minute, most people can’t afford medical treatment. With sad warmth and dark humour, After the Cuts tests how far we’d go to save the person we love, anaesthetic or no anaesthetic. KWRead the full four-star reviewEver left kids alone to clean up their room and returned to find it twice as untidy? That’s the setup for the Australian company Hoopla Clique’s raucous circus show in the Piccolo tent. Two brothers – one shock-haired, the other floppy-fringed – are ordered to put away their toys, but within five minutes they’re hurling balls at each other, breaking out backflips and wielding homemade weaponry that sends toilet paper streaming every which way. Derek Llewellin and Julian Roberts’ sense of fun is infectious and their high-energy pranks thrill – and occasionally appal – the young audience. The result is a mess that, mercifully, you can leave someone else to tidy up. CWThe sharp-suited Valentijn Dhaenens cuts a convincing figure as a slippery, ambitious politician. The show opens with a speech bloated with metaphors and empty of content. It’s familiar stuff, eliciting wry laughs from the audience. Later, we see him talking strategy, giving statements to the media, making video calls to the family he barely sees, and sending regular, occasionally explicit missives to his lover. It recalls his performance in Ontroerend Goed’s Fight Night, another show about how we vote for the who rather than the what. CLRead the full three-star reviewFifteen junkshop chairs enter the stage: half are pushed on in a rickety procession by one dancer, the others are piled high and given an unwieldy piggyback by her partner. They are precisely placed around the space, creating an obstacle course for the duo, who discover unexpected worlds of play with these props. There’s plenty of mischief and gentle humour in this sophisticated show for the over-threes from Belgium’s Compagnie Nyash, choreographed by Caroline Cornélis and deftly danced by Miko Shimura and Colin Jolet. A sophisticated, spellbinding show for children that deserves to be seen by all ages. CWRead the full four-star reviewSuch is cabaret star Le Gateau Chocolat’s following, there are plenty of child-free audience members to see him hatch his first family show. Whether they’re taken from Willy Wonka, The Lion King or the Pussycat Dolls, the songs he has chosen to cover – as in his grownup set, Icons – feel both personal and universal as they celebrate fun, fantasy and pride. Riffing on Hans Christian Andersen, this is the tale of a duckling who doesn’t quack and kick in quite the right style for a feathery circus troupe. There is some sparkle here, and a sprinkling of audience participation, but the show isn’t afraid of darkness – not least in its lugubriously lit and exquisitely designed set. You’re left savouring not just the singer’s voice – warm and deep enough to bathe in – but also the elegant drawl of Tommy Bradson’s narration. CWJoke that you’re “the nation’s favourite comedy rap-jazz duo” and you’re bound to recall “New Zealand’s fourth most popular folk parody act” – as if it weren’t hard enough already for musical comedy duos to escape Flight of the Conchords’ shadow. But Harry Baker and Chris Read have made waves over the last year (Radio 2 appearances guest slots on Russell Howard’s show on Sky) with their brand of peppy comic song. Provided you put Conchords comparisons to the back of your mind, their latest fringe offering makes for a pleasantly erting hour. BLRead the full three-star reviewBy rights, a verbatim report of a 17th-century court case should be no more compelling than one that happened last week. Yet the reverse is true in Breach Theatre’s tremendous three-hander evoking the 1612 trial of Agostino Tassi, who was accused of rape by Artemisia Gentileschi, a gifted baroque painter, who was 15 at the time of the alleged attack. MFRead the full four-star reviewThe trick to writing a monologue is finding a reason for a character to speak. If they are alone, what motivates them to address us? Katherine Parkinson has a novel solution. Making her playwriting debut, the IT Crowd and Humans actor takes us into an artist’s studio where three models of different generations are posing. Sharing the stage, they speak out of embarrassment. Their words spill forth to fill the void. MFRead the full three-star reviewArmed with glitter, songs and a diagram of her vulva, Fran Bushe is on a mission to kickstart her own libido and change how we think and talk about female pleasure. After trying to enjoy sex for 15 years and facing unhelpful advice from GPs, she is taking matters into her own hands. Though, of course, it’s not that simple. She wants a quick fix, a happy ending. Much of her solo show is about how life and sex don’t work that way – and all of this is surprisingly funny. We might finally be having more sophisticated conversations about consent, but Ad Libido makes it clear that we need to go further. CLRead the full four-star reviewJust the Tonic at the Tron, 3.40pm, until 26 August“The reigning queen of New York’s live storytelling scene,” trumpets Jon Ronson from Sara Barron’s publicity. Odd then that For Worse isn’t a storytelling show, but no-frills standup addressing sex, marriage and new motherhood. It’s good too, although given the raucous subject matter and bar-room environment, it might fly higher in an evening slot. Barron misses few opportunities to flout propriety, waxing ambivalent about parenting, heaping scorn on other couples’ sweet nothings, and going dewy-eyed at the memory of her “two dicks in a day!” sexual peak. The brand of brazenness on show feels quite familiar, but this UK-based American carries it off with verve. BLThe Britain’s Got Talent star Lee Ridley’s new show, Inspiration Porn, is more political and vulnerable than anything you’d expect to see on the same TV programme as Simon Cowell. It is a distinctive mix of barbed disability comedy and self-mocking humour, in which Ridley caustically mocks the inspirational rhetoric that surrounds high-achieving disabled people, contrasting “yes we can” Paralympic mottos with the realities of his own life: lazy, lonely, he tells us, and “shit at everything”. The entwining of private and political is adroitly done, and Ridley’s call-to-arms to fight, not for heroic inidual success a la Britain’s Got Talent, but for social justice is – irony of ironies – inspiring. BLRead the full three-star reviewAn award-winner at the Brighton fringe, this amusingly ramshackle two-hander recasts female ageing as a mythological quest. Armed with an invisibility cloak (a beige M\u0026ampS cardie) and tongue sharpener, off set Emma Edwards and Abigail Dooley across the sea of apology and the bridge of tears, on a mission to slay ageing itself. Directed by Spymonkey’s Toby Park, Edwards and Dooley have gleefully improper fun mocking the expectations of fiftysomething femaledom, as clownish prop-comedy splices with confessional moments about growing old. It’s so DIY as to teeter, like the middle-aged body, forever on the edge of collapse, and the pace sometimes lags. But its up-yours spirit is as infectious as the don’t-take-yourself- too-seriously message it so cheerfully exemplifies. BL “I’m the bisexual daughter of a Catholic deacon. And I’ve got OCD.” So Catherine Bohart introduces – and sums up – her textbook fringe debut, Immaculate. The brand of OCD from which Bohart suffers is called perfectionism, which you might have guessed from the scrupulously accomplished nature of her show. Never less than meticulously, she wins our trust, sets up her character and themes, spins the plates awhile before closing in on a heart-warming finale (with obligatory comic sting). It’s a mite schematic. But Bohart is great company, milking her obsessive compulsions for featherlight laughs, and the tale she tells – of her parents’ courtship in repressive 20th-century Ireland of daughter and dad learning to love one another’s queerness and Catholicism – is elegantly told. BLDenim, the queens of subversive late-night drag cabaret, put on an afternoon kids’ concert in which they clean up some of the content, keep the inclusive message and lose none of their wit or glamour. For the over-fives, what’s not to like about a quintet with fabulous frocks, megawatt smiles, glittery facial hair and a gift for make-believe? They treat the cosy Piccolo tent as if they’re playing to 80,000 of their biggest fans. Aqua’s Barbie Girl becomes a slow jam (“Life in sequins, it’s got new meanings!”), Cyndi Lauper’s anthem is rejigged for the school run (Mothers Just Want to Have Fun) and Let It Go has seldom sounded so empowering. By the time they’ve given some of the kids a drag-queen makeover and mashed together Miley Cyrus and Bon Jovi in the closing medley, the bond between performers and audience feels just about unbreakable. CWThis collaboration between Scottish director Al Seed and Australian choreographer-dancer Lina Limosani is a richly crafted theatrical tapestry that cleverly questions notions of destiny and female agency. It transposes the three Fates of Greek mythology (who spin, measure and cut the cloth of life) from antiquity to a bleak cosmic sweatshop. Nigel Levings’ gloomy green-tinged lighting enhances the uncanny atmosphere, while Guy Veale’s strange electronic soundscape mixes bassline thumps with the insistent bleeps of some mythic morse code. AWRead the full five-star reviewAt first sight it’s just your average bright-red halterneck jumpsuit, but the shiny H on the waist gives her away. Writer-performer Kate Kennedy plays superhero Hunch, whose gift for gut intuition gets her recruited to join the ranks of those protecting the metropolis of Hum (she takes the office next to the loo in the super-HQ). Directed by Sara Joyce, DugOut Theatre’s dynamic solo show has plenty of kapow, thanks to some stylised movement and scene transitions that mirror the action-packed panels of a comic book. Kennedy raises a range of questions about how we make decisions and who we trust. The storyline doesn’t have enough emotional punch, but Kennedy proves she could become a super-powered performer nonetheless. CW“Old-fashioned,” Maureen Lipman calls herself at the start of Up for It, and the term certainly applies to her show, a medley of music and standup, character comedy and counter-revolutionary views on #MeToo. It is, she says, the kind of cabaret that she and co-star, jazz singer Jacqui Dankworth, would enjoy, and will likewise appeal to anyone drawn to big personalities, old jokes and music so smooth you could slide a whisky tumbler down it. BLRead the full three-star reviewDublin-based Malaprop Theatre play mind tricks on us. In three discrete scenes, John Doran, Breffni Holahan and Maeve O’Mahony interrogate ideas about faking history, questioning absolute certainty and curating cultural memory. In each, they pick at a nugget of a conversation – their own or one remembered – smoothing the bumps of memory and creating a thin new film of fiction over fact. A stage manager bustles around the set, manipulating the story, and Malaprop’s deeply layered meta-theatricality dances a step ahead of the audience, teasing and probing. KWRead the full four-star reviewLast year, Rose Matafeo cast herself as the perfect Sassy Best Friend. Now she explains why she’s never been quite right for romantic lead. Horndog is a history of the Kiwi comic’s brushes with love and sex – and, having kissed nine people in her life (she’s 26), that easily fits into a fringe hour. And what an hour it is: another storming set from a woman whose neuroses, intelligence and flamboyant sense of her own ridiculousness make her a near-perfect comedian. BLRead the full four-star reviewThis gloriously silly show about growing up and growing apart, finely stitched into a series of unpredictable, beautifully performed sketches, leaves you light-headed with enjoyment. If you have seen Sheeps’ earlier work, or are familiar with Liam Williams’ dour persona elsewhere, the razzle-dazzle song-and-dance opener is intensely funny. Their sketches pull in all sorts of directions, from surrealist to clever-clever to a brand of political (one sketch is about Syria) that’s seething, sarcastic and ridiculous at the same time. BLRead the full five-star reviewIn the damp, dim space of Underbelly’s Big Belly, the stage seems to teem with people. Julian Spooner, alone in the gloom, embodies a restless crowd, moving fluidly from one person to the next. He is a shapeshifter – a ruthless soldier one moment, a cowering mother the next. In this updated take on Dario Fo’s famous performance piece, Spooner tackles a huge cast of characters, from rowdy drunks to Christ on the cross. Each is distinct with an astonishing sharpness and clarity. CLRead the full four-star reviewWhen Midsummer debuted at the Edinburgh fringe a decade ago, it was a quiet affair. Two actors on a stage with guitars, slowly falling in love. Today, David Greig’s explosive revival pairs young Bob and Helena (Sarah Higgins and Henry Pettigrew) with older versions of themselves (Benny Young and Eileen Nicholas) to create a joyful story of love, uncertainty and stupid decisions. A glorious tale of making the most of it. KWRead the full five-star reviewTraverse at Jeelie Piece cafe, 8pm, until 26 AugustTucked in a cafe off the edge of the Meadows in Edinburgh, a roomful of strangers stare down at their phones. Perched at a corner table, Terry (Terry O’Donovan) gets a text, and our phones vibrate. Terry’s ex-boyfriend Luka has passed away. His screen is shared with ours, and we see the flood of condolence texts, calls and emails pile up from people he hasn’t spoken to in years. Having been named Luka’s online legacy executor with the new app Fidelis, Terry has to choose whether to keep or delete. Exploring intimacy and loneliness, User Not Found is a beautiful song of love and letting go. With a smart actor and live technology, User Not Found makes use of a newly intimate form of storytelling. KWRead the full four-star review“Theatre is dying. Garry is our only hope,” we’re told. Damien Warren-Smith plays Garry Starr: gangly of limb, quivering with sincerity, and frequently stripped down to nothing but a ruff. He’s here to rescue forsaken theatre by demonstrating every one of its genres in 60 minutes. You can almost hear theatre’s heart come pounding back to life – but defibrillation has seldom been this uproarious. BLRead the full four-star review hereThe playground is a battlefield. Max and his best mate, Stevie, know that more than most. They’re the boys ducking punches and running from bullies, the boys who try to talk tough but feel scared. And for the hour we spend with them in Kieran Hurley and Gary McNair’s new play, they’re the boys hiding out in the school loos, waiting for Max’s imminent fight – his square go – with resident tough guy Danny. CLRead the full four-star reviewAs a demo of comic and performing talent, you can’t fault Emma Sidi’s Faces of Grace. Whether it stacks up to more than the sum of its parts – these portfolio character-comedy shows often don’t – is moot. We meet five characters, from “kinetic-somatic movement practitioner” Cathy via a vacuous young American easily enthused by the banal (“Oh my God, how good is Pizza Express?!”) to a Love Island wannabe snogging Billie Piper at a bus stop. The show crunches realism and absurdism, and its significance remains largely elusive the ostensible theme (all the characters are seeking a state of grace) feels tenuous. But Sidi’s transformations are pretty extraordinary – an ageing Hollywood grande dame comes to life with little more than a Blanche Dubois accent and two downturned corners of the mouth – and the writing and performing are pleasingly spry. BL“I’m the riskiest comic in the biz,” Jordan Brookes boasts in his new show, Bleed. Then he tells us again, and again, until the phrase collapses into gibberish, and his self-esteem collapses, too. Last year’s gripping show Body of Work, nominated for the Edinburgh comedy award, had many hailing Brookes in just those terms. But on the evidence of this follow-up, which is even better, success won’t go to his head. There can’t be much room in there, after all, what with self-loathing, images of violence, playful impulses and limitless ideas for how to subvert a comedy show all jostling for attention. BLRead the full four-star reviewTime to bow our heads and contemplate the passing of inanimate objects. Let us remember the one-eyed space creatures consumed by monsters on German TV, the plastic farm animals strewn to the ground by careless children and the hot-headed balloon man who breathed in too deeply. These and many other death scenes are taken from the “greatest puppet shows in history” by Canada’s Old Trout Puppet Workshop with a style that goes from Looney Toons to Edward Gorey and all points in between. It’s as funny as it is inventive – perfect festival fodder – and all the richer for the darkness and poignancy that grows out of the laughter. MFPart modern murder mystery, part romantic ballet classic, this is a zippy reworking of the big 19th-century Giselle. Splicing enough pointe and arabesque drama into 100 minutes to validate its full-scale provenance, choreographer Ludovic Oniela (formerly of the Royal Ballet) takes a chamber group of 11 from Ireland’s national company on a contemporary urban glide down love’s slippery slope. ABRead the full three-star reviewMemories of Liam Williams’ debut five years ago are stirred by this rookie set from Rob Oldham. The younger comic occupies similar territory, somewhere between depression, wry humour and millennial existential angst. He contrasts his relatively privileged, meaningless life with that of his grandad. One fought a war, the other sits at home talking to his dog and failing to write a novel. In lieu of that magnum opus, we get “tonal prose poems” about being young in 2001, sardonic alternatives to Brexit, and potshots at listicle culture. Sometimes it’s a bit underpowered. One or two routines (a strong one about, er, guns and butt-plugs a more generic bit on the bronze age) seem to belong in a different show. But Worm’s Lament remains a vivid snapshot of being young and half-alive in the 21st century, and whets the appetite to see what Oldham will do next. BLThose who shoot from the hip can easily shoot themselves in the foot, but Fin Taylor seems happy to take that risk. He is one of those provocateur comics whose fearless plain speaking can shade into shock-jockery. But he’s a lively watch and often worth listening to: in recent years on the subjects of race and leftwing tribalism, and now – hold on to your hats! – on post-#MeToo gender politics. He strikes a decent balance between having fun, teasing at bien pensant limits and trying to progress the conversation on gender. Amid the garish sex comedy and loud disdain for fashionable opinion, he is making a striking effort to embrace the complexity of modern sexual behaviour. BLRead the full four-star reviewNew Zealand standup Alice Snedden makes her fringe debut with Self-Titled, and its keynote is confidenc, the show’s subject and its defining characteristic. Nothing about Snedden’s cool and capable delivery says debutante, as she talks us through her home-birth photo album, her sexually overactive parents and her unprecedentedly low Uber rating. There’s a great gag about PMS, too. Through it all, she sends up her self-satisfaction with a lovely light touch, but never backs away from it, as her short set comes up to date with some sacrilegious reflections on #MeToo. There are a couple of weak routines, but one of them is redeemed, as Snedden hits us with a crowd-pleasing party-piece finale. BLDonald Sage Mackay as Roger could be your next-door neighbour, charming, even-tempered and tolerant. After stumbling across the Angry Alan website, he goes through a process of radicalisation and falls for the myth of a gynocentric conspiracy that blames feminism for his reduced status in the world. But there’s something about Roger’s cool-headed reasoning that quickly pushes the play beyond easy satire. His rationale, however misguided, is honestly felt. The play shows how the force of a compelling narrative might throw any of us into a spiral of self-deception. MFRead the full four-star reviewThomas made his name as a leftwing agitator, needling pomposity, fighting injustice, righting wrongs. There’s no edge missing here, but his boyish enthusiasm is a reminder that he is foremost a humanist. He makes a smooth transition, in Nicholas Kent’s carefully paced production, from a celebration of the NHS in its 70th-birthday year to a critique of the complacency, underinvestment and creeping privatisation that is poised to bring it down. MFRead the full four-star reviewShvorne Marks plays Irene, a devout young woman detained after performing a song in a coffee bar. Getting to grips with what offence she has caused makes up the play’s narrative intrigue. In a bleak concrete prison, she is visited by Scarlett Brookes as her best friend Anna and Amanda Wright as secular lawyer Gudrun. In a sequence of short scenes and very short sentences, Skinner shows how a small act of resistance can turn an independent thinker into a political revolutionary. MFRead the full three-star reviewIt is a potent cocktail: a goofy interactive comedy about a macho “douchebag”, with a confrontational sting in its tale. Nate starts superbly, as Palamides – disguised under a lumberjack coat, biker boots, shaggy moustache and marker-pen chest hair – motorbikes on stage to a cock-rock soundtrack. She is chugging cans, toting fake phalluses and flaunting her 2D masculinity. BLRead the full four-star reviewIn the Alice-in-Wonderland logic of the National Rifle Association, “guns don’t kill people, people do”. Martín Zimmerman’s On the Exhale is an attempt to get under the skin of a debate that tells you more about America’s fraught relationship with its history and constitution than it does about reasoned argument. In this story about a bereaved mother, there is a mesmerising performance by Polly Frame. Still, matter-of-fact and measured, her delivery is gripping in its economy and hits home like a bullet. MFRead the full four-star reviewIan Kershaw’s science-fiction fantasy follows an apparently accidental romance that turns out to have been written in the stars. What makes it special, in Raz Shaw’s good-looking production, is the superb performance of Julie Hesmondhalgh as the unnamed narrator, meticulously colouring in the stories of neighbours, friends and love rivals whom she identifies by the footwear she finds in the shoeboxes of Naomi Kuyck Cohen’s set – and also by the shoes she borrows from a willing audience. MFRead the full three-star reviewArguments about Europe, sovereignty, Britain’s place in the world – they’ve all happened before, says Kieran Hodgson. The 2016 referendum was just a cover version. In his new show, ’75, the two-time Edinburgh comedy award nominee traces the roots of our current Brexit malaise back to the 60s and 70s. Few comedy shows since Mike Yarwood’s heyday have leaned so heavily on impersonations of Barbara Castle, Roy Jenkins and Ted Heath. But if Hodgson’s latest is research-heavy – a quality he cheerfully sends up – it’s never fusty. He has created a set that’s enlightening, heartfelt and jam-packed with funny. BLRead the full four-star review“I thought I’d be called,” says Sarah Morris as Donna, as she stumbles apologetically into Mr McCafferty’s classroom. Despite being 29, when she wants to ask a question she instinctively raises her hand. Stephen Jones as her estranged husband, Brian, is scarcely more confident, though he has a bullish swagger to cover his insecurity. In Iseult Golden and David Horan’s fraught and quarrelsome three-hander, this primary school represents a schism. It is not just about the educated and the unread, but the haves and the have-nots. In a society organised to benefit the better off, the school is the site of class warfare. MFRead the full four-star reviewDavid Ireland’s heady black comedy is a satire as timely as it is riotous. If Jacobean revenge tragedies were played as uproarious comedy, they’d look like this. It’s rare to hear an audience repeatedly gasp out loud at the wince-inducing action on stage. Like Jerry Sadowitz, Ireland can make you laugh and doubt the wisdom of your laughter at the same time. MFRead the full five-star reviewIn this dystopian satire, to deviate from the politically correct rules is to initiate social and professional suicide. B (Katherine Pearce) makes a misjudged joke and trips into a world of cultural landmines and magnified consequences. B’s caricaturish colleagues live in a perpetual state of forced, grim wokeness, wearing anonymous suits and tight corporate grins. Under Stef O’Driscoll’s direction, virtue signalling becomes a tangible action: every time an actor says a particular word, their arms wave or knees dip like exaggerated air quotations. The absence of banned words makes the audience fill in the gaps, and allows for the debate to work for any social issue. Let’s start talking to each other, the play begs, before our words start slapping us across the face. KWRead the full three-star reviewThe unnamed setting of Simon Longman’s play is a dead-end place, robbed of jobs and hope, where getting drunk is the only way to pass the time. Sam’s focused on survival, while Pete just wants to get laid. Only Kate plans to escape – if the town will let her. In the encircling space of Paines Plough’s Roundabout theatre, Stef O’Driscoll’s staging creates a clammy sense of imprisonment, making us feel the constraints of geography and circumstance. Kate, Sam and Pete are vivid personas from the moment we meet them, slugging cider and taking the piss out of each other. The laughs keep coming until suddenly, with a shock, they start to feel like kicks to the gut.

In one of the lawsuits, the plaintiff Kalman Isaacs said Musk’s tweets were false and misleading, and together with Tesla’s failure to correct them amounted to a “nuclear attack” designed to “completely decimate” short-sellers. The lawsuits filed by Isaacs and William Chamberlain said Musk’s and Tesla’s conduct artificially inflated Tesla’s stock price and violated federal securities laws.Short-sellers borrow shares they believe are overpriced, sell them, and then repurchase shares later at what they hope will be a lower price to make a profit. Such investors have long been an irritant for Musk, who has sometimes used Twitter to criticize them. The stock has since given back more than two-thirds of that gain, in part following reports that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had begun inquiring about Musk’s activity. Musk has not offered evidence that he has lined up the necessary funding to take Tesla private, and the complaints did not offer proof to the contrary. But Isaacs said Tesla’s and Musk’s conduct caused the volatility that cost short-sellers hundreds of millions of dollars from having to cover their short positions, and caused all Tesla securities purchasers to pay inflated prices.

She warns travellers to avoid anywhere offering riding or allowing bathing sessions with elephants: “In some places this means a lot of people every hour with the elephants in the water – it’s not natural for an elephant to be in the water all day with lots of people climbing all over them.”Looking on review sites and images online before visiting elephant camps is also advised. Avoid any companies calling themselves “sanctuaries” that are using bull-hooks or chains, or lacking basic provisions of water, food and shade. Vicki Brown, editor at Responsible Travel, says that the prevalence of riding perpetuates the industry. “It increases demand for captive elephants to be used as tourist attractions – which means more baby elephants must be captured from the wild, or sometimes bred for a life in captivity,” she says. “Captive elephants should be allowed to live as naturally as possible, so if they are forced to display unnatural behaviours – such as dancing, painting or playing football – this is being done for the tourists’ benefit, not the elephants’. Don’t visit these places.”The cruel process of intensively conditioning the elephants to obey keepers and allow people to ride them goes largely unseen by tourists. “In order to ensure they are safe around humans, the baby elephants must be broken in – a brutal and distressing process known as ‘crushing the spirit’,” says Brown. “They are kept in a tiny pen to prevent movement, with their legs tied tightly. They can be severely beaten with sharp objects, screamed at and starved of food and water, which can last for several days or weeks. The psychological impact then means that the fear of being beaten will ensure that the elephant ‘behaves’ around tourists.”Mossman believes that “the tour sector needs to play a much bigger role” in clamping down on animal tourism overall. Earlier this year, Tripadvisor announced further changes to its animal welfare policy, following the “no touching of wild animals” addition in 2016. The company has now also banned sales of tickets to “animal shows and performances where animals are forced to perform demeaning tricks or unnatural behaviours”. But it still lists these attractions on the site, and has been criticised for not going far enough. “We would question how educational touching captive wildlife can really be,” Brown says. “It also permits encounters in zoos where ‘physical interaction is initiated by the animals themselves’, claiming this is ‘a natural behaviour’. But in their natural habitats, wild animals almost never initiate contact with humans, so to describe this as natural is misleading.”So what should travellers do if they see abuse happening? “Do your bit by leaving your own review to warn other travellers. It really does work – many camps are now becoming ride-free as a result of pressure from tourists, the industry and the media,” Brown says. “Photos and videos are especially powerful tools, so be sure to capture evidence if you can. Share on review sites and social media. Tweet them directly.”She also suggests that if you book through a tour operator or agent, raise your concerns with them – many do not have representatives on the ground and only find out about bad practices through travellers alerting them to it. “This is how several of our campaigns have come about – so it really can have a positive impact,” she says. “And if you meet other travellers along the way, warn them. Word of mouth is a powerful tool on the road, particularly in hostels. Do spread the word about the good places you visit too they need all the support they can get.”Although many elephants spend their entire lives in captivity, an increasing number are being cared for by organisations that allow them to live in natural, big, open spaces with other elephants, the correct food and veterinary care. “Ethical tourism is the way forward for captive elephants,” says Mossman, who notes that in many areas, particularly in Thailand, there is no longer adequate land to release them into the wild.Brown also suggests that keeping ex-working or captive elephants in sanctuaries can be the best option. “The vast majority will never be released, as they have been habituated and cannot fend for themselves in the wild,” she says. “Volunteers are very much needed at the sanctuaries – it takes an awful lot of work to care for an elephant. Just preparing food can take hours a day!”With so many organisations now claiming to be sanctuaries, which ones do the experts say are OK to visit or volunteer at?

The environment-focused Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters, labor unions such as the AFL-CIO, Planned Parenthood and National Nurses United have all given Gabbard, a three-term congresswoman, their blessing as she seeks re-election in the November midterm elections.But Gabbard’s stated progressive bona fides have been called into question by her opponents, who are waging an ambitious challenge from the left in the hopes of pulling off an upset in Saturday’s Hawaii congressional primary.Although their prospects are grim, Gabbard’s critics say her views on foreign policy and tolerance for dictators such as Bashar al-Assad deserve another look.As one of the few Democrats to meet with Donald Trump following his election, Gabbard’s unorthodox positioning has drawn scrutiny at a time when progressives have rallied their midterm messaging around opposition to the president. Her highly controversial visit last year to Syria, where she met with Assad, also raised eyebrows both nationally and at home.“The wake up call, for most of us, came when Gabbard met with Trump soon after his inauguration and then with Assad, instead of marching on DC with us and the rest of the Hawaii’s congressional delegation during the Women’s March in protest of what has become an unprecedented abolition of human and civil rights in America,” said Sherry Alu Campagna, an environmental scientist who is among Gabbard’s most well-known primary challengers.“The incumbent clearly has an agenda that does not involve her constituents and we are waking up to the fact that our needs are taking a back seat to her ambitions.”Gabbard has emerged in recent years as a paradox of the progressive movement. When she was first elected to Congress, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow declared at the time: “She is on the fast track to being very famous.”Indeed, Gabbard swiftly cemented herself as one to watch she co-founded the Congressional Future Caucus, bringing together the youngest members of Congress with an eye on addressing issues facing millennials, and landed assignments on the House committees on foreign affairs and armed services.In the 2016 election cycle, Gabbard seized on an opportunity to further her rise to national prominence. At the height of the hotly contested Democratic presidential primary, Gabbard resigned from her position as the vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee and endorsed the insurgent candidate Bernie Sanders. Gabbard’s move came as Democrats struggled to rein in an intra-party feud stemming from allegations that the DNC was working behind the scenes to influence the nominating contest in Hillary Clinton’s favor.Two years later, Gabbard’s support for Sanders has paid idends. Her re-election bid drew the endorsement of Our Revolution, a grassroots political organization launched by veterans of Sanders’ campaign.“She has been an ardent supporter of many of the issues in our People’s Platform: Medicare for All, transitioning to clean renewable energy, criminal justice reform, and making Wall Street pay their fair share,” the group said in a statement.When asked about Gabbard’s meeting with Assad, the group dubbed Gabbard as “a passionate advocate for peace and diplomacy, which often requires meeting with people whose actions we do not agree with”.But Gabbard’s critics argue her views on foreign policy, immigration and gun laws warrant more scrutiny and undermine the agenda upon which Democrats are campaigning across the country.“Nationally, people thought, she checks all the boxes, this is great,” said Shay Chan Hodges, an activist who unsuccessfully challenged Gabbard in 2016. “But I think people have now started looking more closely at her record and what she’s saying.”Gabbard’s opponents have cited her refusal to debate them as evidence of her reticence to publicly defend her record on certain hot-button issues. Gabbard was unchallenged in 2014 and has not taken part in a primary debate since the year she was elected.Hawaii News Now attempted to convene a debate between Campagna and Gabbard to no avail the congresswoman’s campaign defended the move by stating: “She continues to communicate directly with voters across the district.”It is not uncommon for dominant incumbents to generally avoid debates. But Gabbard’s decision to decline to participate in such a forum has exposed her to charges of hypocrisy, since she forcefully advocated for adding more debates between Clinton and Sanders in 2016 in a high-profile split from other DNC leaders.“While she may think this is a strategic move to prevent the success of her challengers, what it really does is silence the discussion of important issues that face Hawaii’s rural constituents,” said Campagna. “It also prevents any opportunities for voters to hold Tulsi accountable.”In 2015, Gabbard was among a minority of Democrats who voted for additional restrictions on refugees entering the US from Syria and Iraq. She has also previously expressed “skepticism” that the Assad regime is behind chemical weapons attacks in Syria, and aligned herself with nationalist figures such as Narendra Modi of India.Breaking with most Democrats, Gabbard has embraced the use of the phrase “radical Islam” – a phrase which to many Muslims has evolved into a dog whistle on the right intended to indict the entire Islamic faith. Gabbard has said she is mindful that most Muslims are not extremists, but joined Republicans in criticizing Clinton and Barack Obama for not employing the phrase, stating: “It’s important that you identify your enemy”.Gabbard declined an interview for this story.“Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard has spoken out strongly against the Trump administration’s travelrefugee ban, the Trump administration’s illegal military strikes against Syria, Trump’s decision to pull out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, Trump’s decision to end DACA, and other dangerous decisions and policies,” Erika Tsuji, a spokeswoman for Gabbard’s re-election campaign, said in a statement to the .Gabbard also stands by her meeting with Assad, her spokeswoman said: “She has stated time and again that peace can never be achieved if we only meet and speak with our friends. If we really want peace, we need to be fearless enough to sit down and speak directly with our adversaries.”Although a majority of Democratic voters in Gabbard’s district and neighboring areas said she was obligated to debate her rivals, the snub has not appeared to have had much palpable effect on her prospects.Colin Moore, an associate professor of political science at the University of Hawaii, said Gabbard’s continued popularity was undeniable. But whereas he predicted Gabbard would sail to another term in Congress, Moore said she has yet to truly be tested nationally — where her ambitions may, in fact, be.“The Hawaii congressional delegation has often thought of itself as a team whose primary goal is to go to Washington and bring federal dollars back to Hawaii,” Moore said. “The way they have done that is work with everyone, keep a very low profile, be around for a very long time and rise in seniority.”“Tulsi has really bucked that trend … she is this national political figure, who appears on CNN and other national media outlets quite frequently, talking about issues that don’t directly affect Hawaii.”“That has led to a sense that she’s neglecting her responsibilities and that she isn’t really serving her constituents well,” he added.It was revealed in June that Gabbard is writing a book to be published by a literary agency that boasts of representing presidential contenders. Last October, she traveled on a multi-day swing through the caucus state of Iowa, urging party unity while fueling speculation of higher ambitions.Although her opponents are far from likely to pull off an upset this cycle, the brimming frustration that Gabbard is taking her position for granted – and skepticism around her progressive image – could foreshadow the challenges that lie ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a578169cad46560454f74ce4ec3af57c37d12967/0_256_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c2781d6cfc326504176f4de988194a5","title":"lombok earthquake leaves idyllic gili islands facing uncertain future","story":"Destruction forces visitors to flee beaches popular with ers and honeymoonersThe walls were swaying as Tori Taylor tried to feel her way across them in the dark after the 6.9-magnitude earthquake shook the island of Gili Trawangan, off Lombok in Indonesia, last Sunday.There had been another large tremor the week before, but this one felt larger.“It was unbelievable, crashing sounds, rumblings of the earth, falling tiles, smashing glass, spraying water, people screaming – absolutely terrifying,” the American, who runs a e resort, wrote in a diary she has kept of the disaster.On nearby Gili Meno, Andi Darmin huddled on the roof of his bungalow with his guests, including a couple and their eight-month-old baby. “Can you get a helicopter?” one of the European guests asked him. “I will pay whatever it costs.”Although they escaped the worst of the disaster, the Gilis – three idyllic islands popular with ers, party lovers and honeymooners – were plunged into emergency mode.On Gili Air, a western doctor and a few English nurses on holiday banded together to erect a makeshift medical tent in a field to treat the wounded, and instructed expats to collect painkillers and other supplies from tourists.On Gili Trawangan, the biggest of the three islands, where at least eight people died, doctors, e instructors and tourists set up a basic camp with oxygen and medical supplies and organised people into groups from minor injuries to the most severe. The bodies of the dead were laid out on the beach on sarongs before they were taken away to be cleaned for burial. Many people camped out overnight, too afraid to sleep indoors.Thousands of panicked tourists left the islands the following day, in some cases scrambling over each other to get a seat on one of the boats. Most headed straight for the international airport, where some slept on the floor as they waited for a flight out.The exodus leaves the mostly western-run tourist businesses facing an uncertain future. “When I look to the right there is no one, when I look to the left there is no one, just hundreds of bikes dumped at the port,” said Sander Buis, the Dutch owner of Oceans 5 Dive on Gili Air.“The weirdest part is that it is not just one part that is totally damaged. Some resorts are not in good shape. Others have no damage at all.”On Friday there was no running water on Gili Trawangan or Air, though there were plenty of supplies – in contrast to the more serious situation on the worse-hit main island of Lombok. Before electricity was reconnected, the owners on Air were clearing out all the island’s fridges and giving away the meat to local residents, who are sending it to their families in the north.Horses used to pull carts on the car-free island of Trawangan were being rounded up after running loose, and taken to the mainland. After reports of looting on Trawangan – there are no police on the Gili islands and it took days for the military to arrive – the security situation was improving.As aftershocks continue – there had been more than 450 by Friday – tourists are likely to stay clear of Lombok and the Gilis for now.Buis said he hoped things would start to feel more normal within six weeks. “Some resorts are not that damaged at all and some are,” he said. “So it is all about when the tourists are ready to come back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fb50cedd62232b7795ab05b0f670a4de95356a8/188_250_613_367/master/613.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=232df959ac5f361ecf98ab5a57ad332e","title":"seatac airport seattle plane takes off without permission","story":"F-15 fighter planes give chase after twin-propellor Q400 barges on to runway at Seattle-Tacoma airport and takes offA plane has been stolen from Seattle-Tacoma international airport by an airline employee and crashed, authorities have confirmed after F-15 fighter jets were scrambled and flights grounded in a major security incident. Military pilots contacted the rogue aircraft and it crashed soon afterwards, said local media, citing sources at the US air force Joint Base Lewis–McChord (JBLM) in Washington state. The plane came down on Ketron Island in the Puget Sound waterway about 25 miles south-west of the airport. Aerial television footage showed a fire in amongst trees.A law enforcement spokesperson said the incident was a suicide. The pilot was described as a 29-year-old ground service agent. The person had crashed by “doing stunts in air or lack of flying skills”, the Pierce County sheriff’s department said on Twitter.An Alaska Airlines spokesperson said the plane had been positioned in a maintenance area of the airport when it was taken. It had not been scheduled for passenger flight. The emergency shut down the airport, known as Sea-Tac, and the surrounding skies. The plane involved was a Horizon Air Q400 with no passengers on board, tweeted Alaskan Airlines. Videos posted online showed an aircraft matching the description being followed by what appeared to be a fighter jet.Recordings of an air traffic control conversation with the 29-year-old pilot supported the suicide claim. “This is not a terrorist incident,” said the Pierce county sheriff’s office, calling it a “suicide, single male”.Paul Pastor, the county sheriff, said there was no indication the person flying the plane had intended any harm to others. “Our information now is there was only one person on the plane. I understand the person may have been doing some air stunts or whatever. Some aircraft were scrambled from the air force base. There was no indication this person flying the plane was trying to damage anything.”Flights were grounded with some passengers tweeting that their plane stopped abruptly on the runway. The Q400 is a twin-engined propeller plane made by Bombardier and sometimes referred to as a Dash-8. Horizon Air is a ision of Alaskan that flies short routes in the western US.Air traffic controllers and pilots could be heard discussing the “ground stop” and dealing with a backlog of aircraft in the aftermath of the drama.The Horizon Air chief operating officer, Constance von Muehlen, confirmed the plane was taken by a Horizon Air employee. “Our hearts are with the family of the inidual aboard, as well as all our Alaska Air and Horizon Air employees,” von Muehlen said by video.Airline employees told KIRO7 News the plane had been parked at a cargo terminal when it was taken. According to the Seattle CBS affiliate, the pilot then entered the line of outbound planes and took off around 8pm local time.Air National Guard F-15 fighter jets based in Portland, Oregon, rushed to the area within minutes of takeoff. Arriving ahead of sonic booms, they tailed the airliner for 45 minutes as it circled over suburban areas south of Seattle. The chase passed over a the Chambers Bay golf course, which hosted the US Open in 2015, before the pilot began turning barrel rolls over the Puget Sound.“It was low enough we could make out the Alaska face … so it was really low,” witness Ken Schmidtke told KIRO.The plane crashed in a wooded area of Ketron Island, a speck in Puget Sound believed to be home to 12 people. Firefighters and police boarded a ferry to extinguish the blaze and begin an investigation.The Washington state governor, Jay Inslee, praised the fighter pilots: “Those pilots are trained for moments like tonight and showed they are ready and capable,” the governor said on Twitter.While a criminal investigation is expected, the National Transportation Safety Board will conduct the most detailed review of the incident. Security concerns raised by the crash will be addressed as well.Flights through Sea-Tac airport had hour-long delays running well into the night. Flights erted to other airports in the region arrived later that evening.

Photograph: North West NewspixOmagh man Kevin Skelton shakes his head when asked what he thinks about former DUP leader Peter Robinson’s advice to unionists that they need to think about preparing for a Border poll which could lead to Irish unity.He later pleaded guilty in an Irish court to unlawful assembly, and paid a large fine, thus avoiding a jail term but earning the nickname, Peter the Punt. “I know what I’d do with a Border poll, where I’d push it,” says Skelton.“I couldn’t give a hoot, couldn’t care less. The south of Ireland doesn’t want us, doesn’t need us and can’t afford us. If the vote was held on both sides of the Border they’d likely reject us. Peter Robinson and Mary Lou McDonald would be better putting their time into getting the assembly back together. There’s none of them wants to deal with the past.”Skelton’s wife Mena was one of the 31 people (including unborn twins) murdered in Omagh when the Real IRA’s massive 1998 carbomb exploded without warning on Main Street. Prepared in the Republic, it had been driven north, passing through Clontibret, and across the border into Tyrone.Relatives and friends are bracing themselves for the 20th anniversary on the 15th of this month. The views of the survivors are as erse as the backgrounds from which their loved ones came and Skelton does not claim to speak for anyone other than himself, though his anger at what he sees as the neglect of the victims is widely shared. He thinks a Border poll is irrelevant, and that Brexit is the critical issue.“My fear is that Brexit could start the Troubles up again. I’d be out of here if there was a hard border,” he said. However, he also believes that the real Border in Northern Ireland is the river Bann. The newly released NI statistics on deprivation support his view that the most prosperous areas are in the northeast, with the western Border areas among the most disadvantaged.“Omagh was already struggling on the shavings from the table, and it never recovered from the bomb,” said Skelton. “It is well on its way to being a ghost town.”Further north and further west, the city of Derry has lately been in the news because of a flare up of street violence among young people under the influence of dissident republicans. The violence included sectarian attacks on the Fountain estate, a tiny unionist enclave alongside the old city walls on the by now almost entirely nationalist west bank of the river Foyle.On Wednesday night a remarkably civil and wideranging debate took place on the other side of the river, the largely unionist Waterside, in a Protestant church hall. Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald and DUP MP and chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson were among the speakers discussing the future of the Northern state.The event was one of 40 in the New Gate Fringe Festival, organised by the North West Cultural Partnership, which includes the Londonderry Bands Forum the membership of which is drawn from young men from some of the most deprived loyalist estates in the region. Public debates including working class nationalists and republicans have long been a feature of Northern political life. An audience predominantly made up, as this one was, of working class unionists is far more rare.“What’s your take, Sir Jeffrey?” said June Elder. Donaldson said the DUP was very clear on the question. “Peter does not speak for the DUP. He is retired. I do,” he said. “I don’t share his view.”Considering such a poll would polarise people and cause further ision, he had not had a single email from a constituent about it. “We are preparing for Brexit.”Elder came back after his response with a supplementary question. “So was Peter just off on a rant?” she asked. “No,” said Donaldson with a tight smile. “He was expressing his opinion.”“Well,” retorted Elder, sceptically, to laughter. “My TV shows the same as yours.”Joe Thompson said he was a unionist but he was angry with the DUP. “For decades they’ve insisted this part of the country is British and now with Brexit they say it can’t be treated any differently from England, Scotland and Wales,” he said. “But people are treated differently when it comes to reproductive rights, marriage rights and the Irish language act.”Donaldson said devolution meant that different parts of the UK would have different laws. He said the place to legislate for the issues Thompson raised was at Stormont and reiterated his party leader Arlene Foster’s accusation that Sinn Féin was “holding to ransom” the parties which wished to resume powersharing. “We no longer have a veto,” he said, pointing out that to use a “petition of concern” to block new legislation 30 votes were needed. “We only have 28,” he said.McDonald retorted that Foster had just that morning backed the use of a blocking mechanism to prevent a local council from flying the rainbow flag this weekend, Saturday August 4th, as part of LGBTQ Pride events around the North.Afterwards, Thompson, who works in Derry and lives in Mid Ulster, told The  he was not satisfied with Donaldson’s response. “The DUP is coming across as just so arrogant,” he said. “They’d get their 30 votes to block progressive change – they know it and so do we. I support the union but I vote Alliance now. Peter Robinson was right to say what he did about a Border poll. It is going to happen and the chaos that followed the Brexit vote showed that we need preparations.”The audience at the debate strikingly included many young people. On his way out after an intense 2½ hours, Chris Smith said a Border poll would be pointless. “It is not a question people need answered,” he said. “I am a unionist and I want the politicians either to get Stormont up and running or go back to Direct Rule. As it is we are losing out every way. My girlfriend works in the NHS here and she has just had to forego a payrise that colleagues elsewhere are getting. My mate is a firefighter but because of cuts his job is about to be lost.”Julia Kee, a community worker on a programme made possible by the EU’s Peace 4 funding, shared this view. “We have more important things to be thinking about than a Border poll,” she said. “I am a unionist and we have been hearing nothing but this anti-choice, anti-LGBT rights talk from the DUP.“The political impasse is creating political unrest around Northern Ireland including here in this city,” she said. “Then you get politicians calling young people scumbags and that does not help.”Hospital consultant Fergal McNicholl is from Greysteel, the Co Derry village which became internationally known after loyalists burst into a pub there in 1993 and sprayed it with gunfire, killing eight people. He came to the debate at the invitation of his friend, Dave Duggan, a writer from the city.“I felt quite privileged to be here tonight,” said McNicholl. “It was very impressive that they got a mixed audience and the fact that there was no tension was a massive step forward.” He was not inclined to favour preparing for a Border poll. “The territorial issue puts our identity back into conflict – I quite like it the way it was,” he said. “There was a period where I felt I could be comfortably Irish in this town and live beside someone who was comfortably British. Brexit has already raised territorial issues. It makes things harder. It unsettles us.”Georgina Campbell is a young dancer. She told the panel that she was worried and wanted to know if, in a new Ireland, the likes of her would have a place. She said that the Highland dancing that is her medium is rooted in British military history and that the highest honour available is to dance for the queen. Afterwards, she explained that a Border poll meant nothing to her.“We should just have a government,” she said. “My three best friends are nationalist girls who are self-employed artists. Highland dancers and Irish dancers work together on a regular basis, but a lot of our cultural activities are in our own communities. Northern Ireland is unique and special. We need to embrace it and we need to market it. It is just this big mad eclectic place.

words","story":"The technique could allow people to read news on the small screens of smartphones more easilySince the Greeks switched from etching words in stone with a chisel to writing with ink on parchment or papyrus, the Western world has read from left to right.But the BBC has launched a new project which could completely change the way we process words.The corporation is testing a new kind of speed-reading technology in which news bulletins on smartphones or watches would be flashed up one word at a time, rather than being shown in full sentences.As part of the new technique, the reader\u0027s eye is drawn to the \u0027optimal recognition point\u0027 in the word, which is highlighted red.  That helps the brain identify the word more quickly than with traditional horizontal scanning so that words can be scrolled through more quickly. The optimum recognition point in the word is highlighted red to avoid having to scan horizontally to find the meaning While the average person reads at a rate of around 200 words per minute, the BBC are testing speeds of 300 to 800 words per minute.Speaking about the new project, Cyrus Saihan, the BBC’s Head of Digital Partnerships, said: “UK adults now spend more time online and consuming media each day than they do sleeping. We wanted to see what new technologies could be applied to make this overload of information easier for our audiences to manage.“The technology that we have used in our experiment works on the theory that, by showing you only one word at a time, your eyes can stay in a fixed position and so don’t have to be constantly moving whilst you read.“As a result, the rate at which you can read can be dramatically increased.”The technology could help people read smartphones more easily The corporation are working alongside the technology company Spritz, which invented the technique.Mr Saihan said it took a few minutes to adjust to the new process and after that it becomes ‘relatively easy’ to read full sentences. He claims it will with the problem of reading on smaller and smaller screens and make it easier to catch up on the headlines on a packed bus or train.The BBC said at the moment the project is just an experiment to see what is possible, but said such technology may become crucial in a world of augmented and mixed reality devices.Mr Saihan added: “We might need to completely adapt the way that we read – reading large blocks of text in mid-air might not be possible.“Perhaps speed reading text floating in the air, one word at a time, might become something that the children of the future consider to be the norm.”The BBC has teamed up with SpritzHowever experts have warned that the brain may not be able to keep up with such fast scrolling which could lead to eye problems, tiredness and failure to understand the sentence.Dr Cyriel Diels, a cognitive psychologist and human factors researcher at Coventry University said “A big difference with normal self-paced reading is that this system-paced reading requires continuous focus and attention on the display to be able to understand any text.“This will require more effort and may easier lead to fatigue and eye strain. As it is system paced you can easily miss out words and hence no longer understand the content.“People’s ability to follow the text will be different for different people, some may be able to follow it at high speeds whereas others won’t.“Having said that, I think it’s a great idea and impressive how well it works. It may be very suitable under certain circumstances. I don’t think it can totally replace traditional reading.”Epilepsy Action also said that they would want the technology to pass tests to make sure it was safe for people with epilepsy before it was rolled out“While this is potentially very exciting technology, it would need to be rigorously tested to ensure that this is safe for people with photosensitive epilepsy,” said a spokesman.“Any video containing flashing or flickering lights, or patterns should be tested to ensure that they will not trigger seizures.”\u0026#39Suicidal\u0026#39 mechanic steals plane from Seattle airport, is chased by F-15 jets and then crashes in the seaBravissimo lingerie brand criticised for telling a customer bigger busted models are not \u0026#34confident\u0026#34Comment: What if InfoWars is a secret puppet of the establishment?Comment: The US is taking stronger action against Russia than our European allies arePrivate school pupils three times as likely to appeal exam results after SNP introduces chargesScotland\u0026#39s only openly-trans councillor quits frontline politics after \u0026#39abuse\u0026#39 Judge clears way for America\u0026#39s first execution using fentanylMother \u0026#39held in Dubai for three days after one glass of wine on flight\u0026#39Comment: The row over the burka reveals just how idiotic the political class has becomeSalisbury explosion: Person dies after fire breaks out at military factoryGerman far Right rebuffs Steve Bannon\u0026#39s effort to forge Europe-wide populist movementRomanian police tear gas anti-corruption protesters as expats return home to voice angerGerman police save terrified man from baby squirrelNew type of malaria net reduces cases in children under five, study finds Father shames council that sent him letter riddled with spelling mistakesCorbyn likened Israel\u0026#39s West Bank actions to the Nazi occupation of EuropeVanity Fair sceenwriter defends decision to include racist scene in new ITV period drama and says it would have been \u0026#39cowardly\u0026#39 to remove itTrump\u0026#39s new tariffs send Turkey\u0026#39s currency crashing, as Erdogan tells people to \u0026#39trust in God\u0026#39Heatwave \u0026#39will cause tens of thousands of homes to sink into the ground\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/08/10/TELEMMGLPICT000171423380_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"chess prodigys world class talent helps family remain britain","story":"Indian born Shreyas Royal has been tipped as a future Grand MasterBritain\u0027s greatest chess prospect, aged just nine, will be allowed to stay in the UK after Sajid Javid personally intervened in the case under exceptional talent rules.Shreyas Royal is widely reported to be on his way to become one of the best chess players in the world but his parents had been told the family would be forced to leave the UK next month when their visa expires. The chess star has already represented England a number of times.

It is thought the combination of the two ingredients kills more mosquitoes and reduces the number of infective bites. The study was the first clinical trial in the world to compare use of bed nets containing two active ingredients with the traditional net.As with therapies against diseases such as a tuberculosis, which use a combination of drugs in patients to help tackle antibiotic resistance, researchers say it is less likely for mosquitoes to become resistant to both chemicals in the combination bed nets.Malaria remains one of the world’s leading infectious killers. In 2016, the disease infected 216 million people across 91 countries, up five million from the previous year and killed 445,000 people, mostly children under the age of five.Some 80 per cent of malaria transmission occurs in Africa. Since 2000, there has been huge investment in malaria control on the continent which has halved the amount of malaria thanks mostly to distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets and spraying of homes with mosquito-killing products.However, in the last three years progress against the disease has slowed – with numbers of infected people now increasing in some areas. Resistance to insecticides is thought to be one of the key causes  behind the stalling progress.“We are now entering a crucial point in the future history of malaria control globally and we need to have some good products,” said Prof Lindsay. “It’s an important contribution to the future of malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa.”Although a mosquito net alone is able to protect against malaria transmission for iniduals, treated nets are crucial in the broader fight against the disease, as insecticides when effective help reduce the overall population of mosquitoes in a community – leading to much more significant declines in rates of malaria.“The critical thing with malaria control is to reduce the average life of a mosquito,” said Prof Lindsay.As well as reducing the rate of malaria, the researchers found that the new nets reduced anaemia rates among children sleeping under them by 52 per cent. Malaria anaemia which results from infection of red blood cells by malaria parasites is a major cause of mortality in children under two years old.The trial which was conducted by a team of scientists from the UK, Burkino Faso and Switzerland was limited to 40 rural areas in Burkino Faso. Going forward, the researchers say that the next step will be to expand the study to further countries in sub-Saharan Africa.Prof Lindsay is hopeful that following further successful trials the  World Health Organization will approve the new nets.Malaria still kills a child every two minutes so we need to keep working to find the best ways to stop this from happening. It is clear that conventional methods used for controlling malaria mosquitoes need to be improved and new additional tools developed, he said.“If we take our foot off the gas, malaria will come back to haunt us again,” he added.War on malaria | On the brink of a breakthrough?Bed nets are crucial in the fight against malaria and have come a long way since the first ones dipped in insecticide were used in Africa in the 1980s. Unlike modern long-lasting insecticidal nets, the insecticide in early nets was not able to withstand washing and had to be re-treated every six months – a logistical challenge in many rural areas.Dr James Tibenderana,  technical director at the Malaria Consortium who was not involved in the research said that resistance was a significant concern.“It’s quite worrying for us to find some of the insecticides are not as effective as they have been in the past,” he said.He said that pyrethroids are rare in that they can get into the yarn of the net effectively at a concentration that is both effective and safe  while being well-priced. “We will probably not get that ideal again so we will be dealing with new dynamics.” “We needed new nets four or five years ago so we are catching up. Whatever net we get now it’s going to take time to get it out there,” said Dr Tibenderana.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security   \u0026#39Suicidal\u0026#39 mechanic steals plane from Seattle airport, is chased by F-15 jets and then crashes in the seaBravissimo lingerie brand criticised for telling a customer bigger busted models are not \u0026#34confident\u0026#34Comment: What if InfoWars is a secret puppet of the establishment?Comment: The US is taking stronger action against Russia than our European allies arePrivate school pupils three times as likely to appeal exam results after SNP introduces chargesScotland\u0026#39s only openly-trans councillor quits frontline politics after \u0026#39abuse\u0026#39 Judge clears way for America\u0026#39s first execution using fentanylMother \u0026#39held in Dubai for three days after one glass of wine on flight\u0026#39Comment: The row over the burka reveals just how idiotic the political class has becomeSalisbury explosion: Person dies after fire breaks out at military factoryGerman far Right rebuffs Steve Bannon\u0026#39s effort to forge Europe-wide populist movementRomanian police tear gas anti-corruption protesters as expats return home to voice angerGerman police save terrified man from baby squirrelFather shames council that sent him letter riddled with spelling mistakesCorbyn likened Israel\u0026#39s West Bank actions to the Nazi occupation of EuropeVanity Fair sceenwriter defends decision to include racist scene in new ITV period drama and says it would have been \u0026#39cowardly\u0026#39 to remove itTrump\u0026#39s new tariffs send Turkey\u0026#39s currency crashing, as Erdogan tells people to \u0026#39trust in God\u0026#39Heatwave \u0026#39will cause tens of thousands of homes to sink into the ground\u0026#39Russell Group universities struggling to fill places through clearing, figures showWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/08/10/TELEMMGLPICT000171392489_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqX8Hk7YqzZnX1ykRWc8eA5J9mKFQ2FaeO1fC0Los9Xj8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"mother held dubai three days one glass wine flight","story":"Ellie Holman a Swedish dentists who was held in DubaiA mother was detained in Dubai for three days with her four-year-old daughter after a drinking a complimentary glass of wine on a flight from London, it is claimed.Swedish dentist Ellie Holman, who lives in Sevenoaks in Kent with her English partner Gary and their three children, was initially denied water and made to clean toilets while in custody, according to human rights group Detained in Dubai.The non-governmental organisation formed to help people held in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said it is representing the woman and her daughter Bibi, who was terrified by the experience.The 44-year-old was arrested on July 13 after having one glass of wine on her eight-hour Emirates Airline flight to Dubai from London, a statement from the group said.She was taken into custody after an immigration official questioned her about her visa and asked if she had consumed alcohol.Bibi Holman was detained with her mother before returning homeMs Holman and her daughter were initially denied food, water and access to a toilet when they were held in a cell together for three days, the group claims.She now faces being detained in Dubai for up to a year while awaiting a court hearing.The group said she and Bibi were travelling to Dubai for a five-day break to visit friends, having visited a number of times before.After landing she was questioned by an immigration official, who said her visa was invalid and she must return to London immediately, the group said.Detained in Dubai | What will get you arrested?Ms Holman claims he was dismissive and rude when she asked if she could buy another visa, and was then questioned about her alcohol consumption - which she admitted.She filmed him on her phone as evidence of his behaviour before learning this was an offence, and that it was illegal to drink alcohol, according to the group.The pair were taken into custody with phones and passports confiscated before Ms Holman was asked to give a blood sample to test for alcohol consumption. She is said to have been refused the chance to phone her partner and was then held in a cell.Ellie takes her partner Gary\u0027s surname but they are not legally married, Detained by Dubai said.Dubai, with its smart hotels, first-class shopping and sunshine, is a popular destination with Britons despite strict laws on personal moralityIn a statement from the group, Ms Holman claims the guards tried to rip out her hair extensions and described the prison as hot and foul smelling. She said the pair were made to sleep on a filthy mattress and she was told to clean toilets and floors.She said: My little girl had to go to the toilet on the cell floor. I have never heard her cry in the same way as she did in that cell.The food (we were given) smelled like rotting garbage and neither Bibi or I could face trying it. I stayed awake for the whole three days.By now, Gary knew something was wrong and had flown to Dubai to look for me. Friends had found out I was in jail and tried to visit. Nobody was allowed to see us. We were not even told.Unusual laws that tourists should be wary ofShe was released on bail and told her passport has been confiscated until the case is concluded. She said she has lost more than £30,000 in legal fees and missed work.Ms Holman is now spending time with her other children Suri, nine, and Noah, eight, who have flown out to Dubai to see her while Gary returns home with Bibi.Radha Stirling, chief executive of Detained in Dubai, said: The UAE maintains a deliberately misleading facade that alcohol consumption is perfectly legal for visitors.Tourists cannot be blamed for believing that the Emirates are tolerant of Western drinking habits, but this is far from reality.It is wholly illegal for any tourist to have any level of alcohol in their blood, even if consumed in flight and provided by Dubai\u0027s own airline. It is illegal to consume alcohol at a bar, a hotel and a restaurant and if breathalysed, that person will be jailed.10 surprising things you probably didn\u0026#039t know about DubaiMs Stirling called on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the UK Government generally to do more to protect British nationals, and claimed airlines were complicit and needed to be held accountable.Consular staff spoke to Mr Holman about the incident, advised him on procedures in Dubai and also spoke to UAE authorities to confirm Ms Holman and her daughter were being released, a UK Foreign Office spokesman said.A Swedish foreign ministry spokeswoman said the case had not been registered with them because they had not been contacted by Ms Holman.Emirates airline has been contacted for comment.\u0026#39Suicidal\u0026#39 mechanic steals plane from Seattle airport, is chased by F-15 jets and then crashes in the seaBravissimo lingerie brand criticised for telling a customer bigger busted models are not \u0026#34confident\u0026#34Comment: What if InfoWars is a secret puppet of the establishment?Comment: The US is taking stronger action against Russia than our European allies arePrivate school pupils three times as likely to appeal exam results after SNP introduces chargesScotland\u0026#39s only openly-trans councillor quits frontline politics after \u0026#39abuse\u0026#39 Judge clears way for America\u0026#39s first execution using fentanylComment: The row over the burka reveals just how idiotic the political class has becomeSalisbury explosion: Person dies after fire breaks out at military factoryGerman far Right rebuffs Steve Bannon\u0026#39s effort to forge Europe-wide populist movementRomanian police tear gas anti-corruption protesters as expats return home to voice angerGerman police save terrified man from baby squirrelNew type of malaria net reduces cases in children under five, study finds Father shames council that sent him letter riddled with spelling mistakesCorbyn likened Israel\u0026#39s West Bank actions to the Nazi occupation of EuropeVanity Fair sceenwriter defends decision to include racist scene in new ITV period drama and says it would have been \u0026#39cowardly\u0026#39 to remove itTrump\u0026#39s new tariffs send Turkey\u0026#39s currency crashing, as Erdogan tells people to \u0026#39trust in God\u0026#39Heatwave \u0026#39will cause tens of thousands of homes to sink into the ground\u0026#39Russell Group universities struggling to fill places through clearing, figures showWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 11 august 2018","story":"A seal pup rescued from  Abereiddy beach in Pembrokeshire is the first to be found abandoned the summer and the warm weather is being blamed.

Passengers on airliners took to social media to relay messages from air crew as they were told their flights would not be taking off.A Horizon Air Bombardier Dash 8 Q400, reported to be hijacked, flies over Fircrest, Washington, the U.S., before crashing in the South Puget Sound, August 10, 2018 in this still image taken from a video obtained from social mediaAlaska Air said a Q400 twin-engined plane, operated by its subsidiary Horizon, was involved.The unauthorised pilot could be earlier heard talking to air traffic control, in communications relayed on aviation websites, reporting that he believed one of his engines had failed.In response, he was told to stay low and over water. Witnesses described seeing the plane nose e shortly after the F15s arrived in the vicinity.News crews following the story said they had spotted smoke coming from an island in southern Puget Sound just off the shoreline of Seattle. Law enforcement officers then tweeted that the plane had crashed and that they believed the pilot was suicidal.The US Coast Guard was sending a 45-foot vessel to the crash scene after witnesses reported seeing a large plume of smoke in the air, according to Petty Officer.Some flights resumed at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport later in the evening, although west-bound departures remained on the ground.John Waldron, who took dramatic video of the stolen plane flying in a loop, told CNN that he was out for an evening stroll when he saw the two jet fighters following the turboprop airplane.His first thought was that they were practicing for an air show. So, I started to capture video, just because I thought it was, kind of bizarre, he told CNN.Waldron said it seemed that the jets were chasing down the airplane. I thought this is really odd. Kept the video rolling.Then the passenger plane pilot did a complete loop ... I couldn\u0027t believe he recovered.He estimates that the plane at its lowest point was no less than 100 feet (30.5 meters) above the water.Then the pilot pulled - pretty much straight up. And kind of at an angle. And almost stalled the aircraft. Somehow he got it leveled back off. And then made his way down toward the island.Waldron said that he was prepared to run and take cover. He briefly turned away, then turned back and saw the explosion as the plane crashed.Saw a bright, pinpoint area of flame. And the smoke. I thought, oh, my god. I think he just crashed.Bravissimo lingerie brand criticised for telling a customer bigger busted models are not \u0026#34confident\u0026#34Comment: What if InfoWars is a secret puppet of the establishment?Comment: The US is taking stronger action against Russia than our European allies arePrivate school pupils three times as likely to appeal exam results after SNP introduces chargesScotland\u0026#39s only openly-trans councillor quits frontline politics after \u0026#39abuse\u0026#39 Judge clears way for America\u0026#39s first execution using fentanylMother \u0026#39held in Dubai for three days after one glass of wine on flight\u0026#39Comment: The row over the burka reveals just how idiotic the political class has becomeSalisbury explosion: Person dies after fire breaks out at military factoryGerman far Right rebuffs Steve Bannon\u0026#39s effort to forge Europe-wide populist movementRomanian police tear gas anti-corruption protesters as expats return home to voice angerGerman police save terrified man from baby squirrelNew type of malaria net reduces cases in children under five, study finds Father shames council that sent him letter riddled with spelling mistakesCorbyn likened Israel\u0026#39s West Bank actions to the Nazi occupation of EuropeVanity Fair sceenwriter defends decision to include racist scene in new ITV period drama and says it would have been \u0026#39cowardly\u0026#39 to remove itTrump\u0026#39s new tariffs send Turkey\u0026#39s currency crashing, as Erdogan tells people to \u0026#39trust in God\u0026#39Heatwave \u0026#39will cause tens of thousands of homes to sink into the ground\u0026#39Russell Group universities struggling to fill places through clearing, figures showWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/01/11/writer-desk.jpg","title":"author how to write advice twitter rule stephen king hemingway","story":"Created with Sketch.We all know there’s more than one way to skin a cat, so why should advice on how to write be so prescriptive? Instead, David Barnett’s got something that he thinks is invaluableClick to followThe Independent OnlineI asked Twitter what sort of writing advice they see a lot which really annoys them. By far the most unpopular edict was the oft-trotted out, ‘You have to write every day’If you are one of the millions of people who aspire to be a published author, I have some writing advice for you: never listen to writing advice.Not that it’s easy to avoid. If you go on Twitter and follow the hashtag #amwriting you’ll get more unsolicited advice than you know what to do with. Do this, do that, don’t on any account do the other. Everyone it seems, has some rules for you to follow.Which is hardly surprising, as literally almost everybody is writing a book. And I use the phrase “literally almost everybody” advisedly. At the BookExpo America conference in 2015, author Jane McGonigal claimed that 90 per cent\u0026nbspof young people in the US say they want to write a book.That’s a lot of potential authors… in fact, if my quick calculations are right, and we take “young people” to be up to the age of 24, that means 75.6 million young people in the States\u0026nbsphave aspirations to be novelists. That’s 10 million more people than the entire population of the UK, and doesn’t take into account all those over the age of 25. Which, in a country where the illiteracy rate is something like 14 per cent, is frankly astonishing.And possibly crap. Here’s not some writing advice for you, but an honest-to-goodness law, as laid down by the science fiction author Theodore Sturgeon: 90 per cent\u0026nbspof everything is crap. Curiously, that’s the same percentage as the young population of America which wants to write a book. And –\u0026nbspthough I have as much scientific backup for this as Sturgeon did for his law –\u0026nbspthe same percentage of writing advice, I’d warrant, that also qualifies as crap.Why am I so down on writing advice? Because it’s often so prescriptive, as though there’s only one way to skin a cat. Which there isn’t. The reason a lot of us do genuinely like to hear about authors’ writing processes is because they’re very often wildly different from each other.If they were all the same –\u0026nbspand edicts about how you should and shouldn’t go about writing would wrongly suggest they are – then we’d only have to hear Neil Gaiman or Gillian Flynn or JK Rowling explain the process once at some book festival, and we’d know how everyone does it.It’s also rather annoying that writers feel the need to issue edicts, as though writing is actually some magical, special, superhuman process that mere mortals can only aspire to. Let’s get this right, writing a book isn’t easy. Writing a good book is harder still. Writing a book that is not just good, but great, and worthy of a publisher throwing money at you, is very, very difficult. But it’s also not rocket science, nor brain surgery. Which is evident by the almost complete absence of rocket scientists and brain surgeons offering Twitter advice on their particular disciplines.mojitos,’ Ernest reminded himselfAnd that may be because, apart from a few tweaks here and there, there really is only one way to science a rocket or surgeon a brain.There’s no room for experimentation, for doing it at your own pace, for finding your own path. Which – advice, ahoy! – are all things you should be doing if you decide to write a book.A couple of months ago the writer Flic Everett tweeted: “I wish plumbers were as fascinated by themselves as some writers are. They could post little ‘plumbing is so tough, need coffee!!’ memes and be all humble about their plumbing awards and recognise each other on Twitter via the hashtag #amplumbing”.You don’t get that much, do you? There is very rarely advice or bragging from plumbers along the lines of “You need to put at least one toilet in a week if you’re going to call yourself a pipe monkey!” or “sealed a dozen pipes with PTFE tape this weekend – no rest for the real plumber!”So I asked Twitter what sort of writing advice they see a lot which really annoys them. By far the most unpopular edict was the oft-trotted out, “You have to write every day.” The adjunct to this is usually that your daily output should generally be about 1,000 words.As with all writing advice, there’s a grain of common sense in it. If you are planning to write a book, then at some point you should actually, you know, put some words together. But there’s nothing enshrined in law that says you have to do this every single day, nor do the requisite 1,000 words, which could be three or four hours’ work, or more, for the fledgling writer.Women gain on men in Forbes list of top earning authorsThis is an example of the “advice” which some writers come out with which is disguised as inspirational but is actually thinly veiled macho bullshit designed to paint the author in question as some kind of tough-as-old-boots Hemingway-esque hard man of letters.Similarly, there are many pronouncements that to be a writer you have to give up all of your free time. Again, a kernel of truth novels don’t write themselves. You’re going to have to steal that time from somewhere, whether it’s foregoing Love Island or getting up an hour earlier, or going to bed an hour later.\u0026nbspBut I saw a Friday tweet recently saying something along the lines of, oh, it’s the weekend again, or as we writers know it, 48 hours of hard work and crushing anxiety. Statements like this suggest as a writer you aren’t allowed free time, that weekends are for locking yourself away from your loved ones and sweating words. Which, sometimes, they are, especially if you’ve got a deadline approaching. But weekends, and evenings, and bank holidays… they should be for recharging and relaxing as well.\u0026nbspAgain, it’s more to do with the person making the statement than any real advice for would-be writers. It’s the Hemingway thing again. Get up at 5am. Write a thousand words. Have three mojitos for breakfast. Go and wrestle a shark. Make violent love to a woman. Smoke a cigar. Skip lunch. Write another thousand words. Be a real goddam writer! Sleep when your dead!Such “advice” is actually counter-productive to the new writer, and I suspect that’s kind of the point. Those setting out on the writing journey might look in awe at @RealGoddamWriter (if that’s actually a genuine account, I apologise in advance) and think, “Well, it’s good of them to share these vital rules for writing, but given that I have a day job and two kids and really, really, really want to watch Love Island tonight, I’m never going to be as good as this person so I’ll just go and weep into my Scrivener app.”Gaiman (Getty)Oh, here’s another piece of most-hated advice from my quick Twitter survey: write what you know. This can be a double-edged sword, because if you do know some good stuff, or have had a few life experiences, it’s not a bad idea to utilise it. Had kids? You’ll know what childbirth feels like. Lost a loved one? You can write bereavement from a position of knowledge. Done a bit of brain surgery? Well, what are you writing a novel for? There’s no money in it, you know.But if we all confined ourselves to writing what we have direct experience of, there’d be no science fiction or fantasy novels. I had a novel published last year about a man on his way to Mars. Come closer, I have a secret: I’m not an astronaut and have never been to space.It’s also a little curious that most writing advice on social media comes from authors who you might not necessarily class as bestsellers. Now, I’m not suggesting only those writers who make the top ten are worth a damn, but unsolicited rules and edicts usually come from authors who are not exactly household names.In fact, call me shallow, but when big-name authors do offer advice, I listen. One of my favourite books – and if you want to write anything yourself, you could do worse than check\u0026nbspit out – is On Writing by Stephen King. It’s partly a memoir, and partly an exploration of his own writing process.\u0026nbspIt’s hugely interesting and inspirational, but it’s also a book that is there only if you seek it out. King\u0026nbsp(and I could be wrong here, but I don’t think I am) rarely takes to Twitter to tell other people how to write. Indeed, in his second foreword in the book he writes: “This is a short book because most books about writing are filled with bullshit. Fiction writers, present company included, don’t understand very much about what they do – not why it works when it’s good, not why it doesn’t when it’s bad. I figured the shorter the book, the less the bullshit.”I’m also fond of what Neil Gaiman said in his 2012 keynote speech to the University of the Arts, which was basically that the best thing to do is ignore advice and plough your own furrow, because then\u0026nbspyou don’t know what you’re doing is considered wrong: “People who know what they are doing know the rules, and know what is possible and impossible. You do not. And you should not. The rules on what is possible and impossible in the arts were made by people who had not tested the bounds of the possible by going beyond them.”Of course, big-name writers have also been prescriptive. Raymond Chandler wrote his Ten Commandments for writing a detective novel. But then, Chandler was a genius, and he put together his rules (sample: it must be honest with the reader) seven or eight decades ago, and didn’t clog up my Twitter feed with them.Even Hemingway, our tough guy of American letters, offered writing guidance here and there. Strangely, very little of it was to do with wrestling bears or typing while running away from bulls. In fact, one of this best nuggets, which is from his memoir A Moveable Feast, is actually advice to himself on getting over writer’s block: “Do not worry. You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.”BBC presenter with terminal cancer writes touching memoir for sonThe greetings you should avoid when writing an emailLove Island’s Niall Aslam is writing a book about Aspergers syndromeWhen I asked people on Twitter for their most hated writing advice, I also asked for the most useful. Practically everyone said the same thing, and I offer it to you now. You may, of course, ignore it completely, but all I can say is, I think you’d be wise not to.The advice is this: if you want to write, then read. Read novels in the area that you’re writing. Read novels in the area that you’re not writing. Read non-fiction. Read the news. Read the back of a Coco-Pops box. Learn how sentences are put together, how stories work, how novels are structured. Learn how Coco-Pops are made, because you never know when you’ll need that information.You wouldn’t expect to play for England without ever watching a football match, no matter how good you think you are hoofing a battered old leather ball around the park on your own. It’s the same with writing. See how others do it, then work out how you’re going to do it yourself. And never let anyone tell you that you’re doing it wrong, or that you should be doing it their way.So, what are you waiting for? Go write a book. But first, maybe go read one.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/13/01/jim-ratcliffe.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/13/01/jim-ratcliffe.jpg","title":"brexit new poll public final say no deal scenario","story":"Created with Sketch.Just one in four trust parliament with the decision as ‘no deal’ looms according to 10,000 strong poll sampleClick to followIndy PoliticsBrexit: Half of Britons want final say in no-deal scenario, major new poll findsHalf of Britons want a referendum on leaving the European Union if Brexit talks collapse and the country faces leaving with no deal, a major new poll has revealed.The huge study carried out by YouGov, which surveyed a weighted sample of more than 10,000 people, found just a quarter want parliament to be given the final decision.The key finding comes as concern over a no-deal Brexit increases, precipitating a slump in sterling\u0026nbspamid news that the UK government is stockpiling food and medicine.The findings are\u0026nbspalso a major boost to the People’s Vote campaign for a new referendum, which commissioned the poll, and The Independent’s own Final Say campaign – which has attracted more than half a million signatories to its petition.The survey also shines a light on views of Brexit’s progress, with large majorities thinking talks are going poorly, that the process of leaving has been a mess, that the country would end up with a bad deal and that the British government would bear responsibility.Former president of YouGov Peter Kellner said: “If the Brexit negotiations with Brussels break down, a two to one majority of voters want the public, not parliament, to decide what happens.“Even people who voted Leave tend to prefer a new referendum, by 39-34 per cent. This is politically significant.Rees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011“There is clearly the potential for a broadly based campaign this autumn for a people’s vote\u0026nbspshould the Brussels talks go badly. Support for a new referendum would go well beyond the ranks of those who want to stop Brexit.”The pollsters asked “should the final decision be made by MPs voting in parliament or the public voting in a new referendum”, if the UK had to choose whether to remain in the EU or leave with no deal.It is now clear that the people are starting to find their voice and they demand a vote on the final Brexit deal as the only way out of this messHalf, 50 per cent, said the decision should be given to the public voting in a new referendum. Just 25 per cent said parliament should decide and 25 per cent said they did not know.Asked whether people agreed with the statement that “the negotiations are going badly at the moment”, a huge 74 per cent agreed to some extent, with just nine per cent disagreeing and 17 per cent saying they did not know.An even larger 83 per cent agreed with the statement that the “process of leaving the EU so far has been a mess”, with just six per cent disagreeing and ten per cent saying they did not know.Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a leading supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “Whether people voted leave or remain two years ago, nobody voted for this chaotic Brexit that will damage our living standards and public services, and which is being thrust on the country by politicians in Westminster.“It is now clear that the people are starting to find their voice, and they demand a vote on the final Brexit deal as the only way out of this mess.”Some 68 per cent agreed that “problems in the negotiations with the EU make it likely that Britain will get a bad deal”, with 13 per cent disagreeing and 19 per cent saying they did not know.In an ominous sign for the prime minister, 64 per cent agreed with the statement “if we get a bad deal, it will mainly be the UK government’s fault”, with 23 per cent disagreeing and 14 per cent saying they did not know.In the case that negotiations are completed, 45 per cent backed a new referendum on the deal, while 34 per cent opposed it\u0026nbspand 22 per cent said they did not know.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

They served alongside professional troops including Paratroopers, Guardsmen and Royal Marines.Much of the cat and mouse pursuit of terrorists centred on the Troodos Mountains which were perfect for guerrilla warfare.But the main street of Nicosia became known as \u0026ldquoMurder Mile because of assassinations.EOKA were led by George Grivas, a Cypriot-born retired Right-wing Greek officer, and inspired by Archbishop Makarios, the head of the Greek Orthodox Church on the island, who wanted it handed over to Athens and Cyprus was granted independence in 1960.But in 1974 the island became ided when Turkey invaded in response to a new attempt to unite it with Greece. Keith Lloyd, who served with the Welsh Guards and lives in Turkish-controlled Northern Cyprus, said: \u0026ldquoEOKA\u0026rsquos favourite method of murder was to shoot British personnel in the back while they were shopping.But the counter insurgency campaign led to suspects being rounded up and interrogated.And the British Government is now fighting compensation claims in the courts over allegations that Greek Cypriot prisoners were tortured during interrogation.

In some cases, quite literally.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoBlackgang opened before teabags had been invented and we quite often see ideas of ours popping up in other theme parks, says owner Alec Dabell, who is named after his great-great-grandfather.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoOne chap was saying how it is hard in our business to generate new ideas.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoBut I\u0026rsquove got 25 years-worth of ideas already and I\u0026rsquom growing exponentially. What I really need to invent is a machine to make more time.\u0026nbspOne of his most recent ideas is a pond with a footpath through the middle enabling you to get a frog\u0026rsquos-eye view of the lily pads.\u0026nbspThere are also singing English dodos, a hall of mirrors, original rides, and the country\u0026rsquos biggest animatronic T-Rex.\u0026nbspBlackgang also has another illustrious claim to fame as the oldest continuously open amusement park in the world.\u0026nbspBlackgang Chine visitors in 1922 (Image: Blackgang Chine)\u0026ldquoDuring the war years the two slightly older ones, in occupied Denmark and Austria, closed but we remained open, he declares.\u0026ldquoOf course we did! We were British and we didn\u0026rsquot shut just because of a bit of adversity. As my grandmother used to say, \u0026lsquoIf the Luftwaffe are overhead then you just lie still and pretend you\u0026rsquore a cow pat\u0026rsquo.\u0026nbspThis is no idle boast.\u0026nbspGerman planes during the Second World War frequently jettisoned unused bombs over the Isle of Wight following attacks on the nearby docks at Portsmouth and Southampton.\u0026nbspAs a little boy Alec, who has an MBA and returned to the island five years ago after a career in the City, grew up in the ultimate playground.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoI had my own cowboy town and didn\u0026rsquot everyone have dinosaurs in the bottom of their garden? How could anyone not have these things?\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoFrom a little boy it\u0026rsquos all I\u0026rsquove ever known. My father is 94 and he put in the dinosaurs in the 1970s.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoI remember sitting on the sofa at home saying, \u0026lsquoCan we have some dinosaurs?\u0026rsquo and a year later along they came.\u0026nbspOne of Alec\u0026rsquos earliest memories is flying in a helicopter hired by BBC\u0026rsquos Blue Peter who had come to witness the first batch of prehistoric creatures being craned in.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoI discovered that John Noakes smoked like a chimney but the real wonder was Mother Nature. Looking up at a dinosaur model and saying, \u0026lsquoDaddy when you said it was big, you didn\u0026rsquot say it was that big!\u0026rsquo\u0026ldquoAnd you can\u0026rsquot argue with that.\u0026nbspA few years ago Alec launched Restricted Area 5 and filled it with the largest animatronic dinosaurs in the UK, made to his specification in China.\u0026nbspIn this way he continues to follow in the footsteps of his namesake who knew it would be possible to create gardens that would appeal to the romantic Victorians but sensed that he needed to offer something more.\u0026ldquoWhen he started children were still seen and not heard, the Battle of Waterloo was barely over and tourism hadn\u0026rsquot been invented.\u0026ldquoIf I\u0026rsquod been able to ask my great-great-grandfather how big the car park was he would have said, \u0026lsquoWhat\u0026rsquos a car?\u0026rsquo Back then there wasn\u0026rsquot such a thing as a business model but there was that really positive Victorian spirit that defied convention.\u0026nbspShortly after Alexander bought his ravine a huge fin whale got stranded off The Needles, the most westerly point of the island and the showman saw his chance.\u0026nbsp                Best theme parks in the UK revealed by TripAdvisor                 Rollercoaster HORROR as girl killed when \u0026lsquopendulum ride\u0026rsquo CRASHESHe bought it at auction, sold off the blubber, had the bones bleached and displayed the skeleton to the morbid curiosity of all who visited.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoBefore then you could read in a book how big a whale was but the chances were that you had never seen one or come across one, points out Alec.\u0026nbspIt proved an instant hit and the park received the ultimate endorsement 10 years later when Queen Victoria herself came to view it.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoIn fact, she came four or five years in a row. Interestingly, 20 years or so later she offered a great deal of input into the building and the exhibits in the new Natural History Museum. As to where she got her ideas I couldn\u0026rsquot possibly comment.\u0026nbspBut he won\u0026rsquot be drawn on current famous visitors.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThere are various well known celebrities but we don\u0026rsquot talk about them. We allow them to be the child within while they are here. That\u0026rsquos the magic of Black-gang.\u0026nbspAnd that alternative way of looking at things is Alec\u0026rsquos raison d\u0026rsquoetre.\u0026nbspHe describes the thrill he gets from seeing the joy on visitors\u0026rsquo faces and the pleasure returning customers gain from stepping back into their childhoods with their own grandchildren.\u0026nbspOwner Alec Dabell said he has 25 years-worth of theme park ideas (Image: Blackgang Chine)\u0026ldquoYou get to be that little girl or boy again and if you feel younger you are younger, insists Alec, who is reluctant to disclose his own age (57) \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos the only moment during our interview when his energy dips.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoOh, age is such a grown-up thing and I\u0026rsquom still playing and that\u0026rsquos what I want to encourage other people to do, he explains.\u0026nbspOne of the grown-up issues that this Peter Pan and his forebears have had to face is the erosion which has seen vast chunks of the amusement park lost to the sea over the years at nearly four metres per year.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoMy great-great-grandfather may not have been much of a structural engineer or have had any understanding of soil types but you wouldn\u0026rsquot want to move it anywhere else.\u0026nbspBeing here, I just can\u0026rsquot help but smile. The sea breeze is nature\u0026rsquos air conditioning.\u0026nbspAnyway, we adapt and move inland and I reckon we\u0026rsquove got enough land left for at least another 175 years, he insists.A few years ago Alec was at a conference of theme park directors and met one of Walt Disney\u0026rsquos original \u0026ldquoimagineers who recalled being at the opening of Disneyland in the 1950s.\u0026ldquoI said, \u0026lsquoExcuse me sir, but do you realise that by then we were already more than 100 years old?\u0026rsquo\u0026nbspThey would give their eye teeth to have what we take for granted.

It later mutated in patients and caused encephalitis \u0026mdash swelling in the brain \u0026ndash which left iniduals in a fatal coma.After 20 months the virus, which was difficult to cure, had killed more than 150 million people in the simulation - and there is no sign of a vaccine being created.

I think Brexit is the least of their difficulties. The Commission is  of the treaties, it has almost become a quasi-religion for them, \u0026lsquohow dare any country even want to leave?\u0026rsquoThe EU has got some significant problems. You\u0026rsquove got a parliamentary election next year on the backdrop of an increasing number of the countries that are concerned about the direction of travel.

Greece is obviously desperately unhappy with the situation it finds itself in.You\u0026rsquove got the Visegrad countries of Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic increasingly working as a bloc, with concerns over the direction of travel, particularly on immigration.With all that on the background, there\u0026rsquos going to be a change of Commission, there\u0026rsquos going to be a change of President, there\u0026rsquos a lot of change in the EU.If it doesn\u0026rsquot change quickly and reflect what people are saying, I think it\u0026rsquos got real difficulties in the future. The EU you see today is going to be a very different one in 10 years time.EU news: Craig Mackinlay warned the EU Commission to change or face trouble (Image: EXPRESS.CO.UK\u0026bull)The Tory MP suggested that Brexit could become the spark kickstarting a series of withdrawals if the UK is perceived as succeeding in its EU-free future.He also argued that member states could defy the common negotiating line set by the Commission to safeguard their interests.\u0026nbspMr Mackinley added: If it is seen to be a successful history afterwards for that country that has left there could be others who want to join leaving the EU as well.I think things will change when we get down to discussing with the nation states because I don\u0026rsquot think they are all that keen for the Commission to be speaking words for them that they really don\u0026rsquot agree with.Mr Mackinlay concluded: In Germany, there are people who are working, there are MPs in Germany who need to get re-elected.If there is a tough Brexit that doesn\u0026rsquot allow for frictionless trade, it\u0026rsquoll be German workers who are put on the street and that will be the reality.We have an opportunity to change, the sooner as the negotiations get to the nation states the better because I think we\u0026rsquoll be on a different framework entirely.Mr Mackinlay is not the first Tory MP to warn Mr Juncker of the risk ignoring member states\u0026rsquo demands could pose to the EU.Nigel Evans said: \u0026ldquo I understand that the European Union are scared that if it\u0026rsquos a great success for the United Kingdom then other countries may wish to follow suit.If I were President Juncker I would look at the reason why it is that other countries are so unhappy with the European Union.

The PM has — finally — started to talk to them with a concrete plan.The silence after her meeting with Emmanuel Macron is concerning, but the noises from German business leaders and politicians from the Continent in recent weeks are more promising.As the clock ticks, it’s time for them to tell Brussels that the theatrics and the anti-Britain briefings have to end. The Chequers fudge is not perfect. But Brussels would be mad to knock it back.And if they do? Planning is already stepping up for a clean-break Brexit.The PM still believes no deal is better than a bad deal and insists she’s ready to walk away.And that, as President Trump knows, is The Art Of The Deal…AND so another new front opens up in the war against the motorist.It’s outrageous that companies in some parts of the country could be charged if their employees drive to work.Those firms, who have already paid business rates for having a car park, will just pass on the extra cost to workers. Another stealth tax, another pocket emptied.We wouldn’t mind so much if we believed the money would be ploughed back into the roads, getting rid of potholes and fixing rocky road surfaces.

I wasn’t surprised I choked on my toast because anything bad that happens to me — big or small — I’ve already lived through in my imagination.But I choked at the sheer obviousness of the scientists’ conclusions. Of course feeling stressed helps people deal with bad news. What next? Scientists discover sleep is related to tiredness?I can deal with bad news better because I’ve already been in that moment. I’m well prepared because I’ve actually lived it in my head.Anyway, the choking passed and, to my surprise, I didn’t die. That’s another beauty of always believing the worst will happen. What a wonderful surprise it is when the worst doesn’t happen.The toast didn’t kill me. I cheated the choke. Oh, the joy.I don’t know how long I’ve been this way. It’s definitely been going on since I was a kid.I remember flying off on holiday to what was then Yugoslavia with my mum and dad. I recall my mum trying to talk to me about all the exciting things we’d be doing when we got to my nan’s house on the Adriatic.I kept shaking my head and not saying anything and she got annoyed and rolled her eyes, thinking I just wasn’t looking forward to our holiday.But she misunderstood me. I didn’t want to think about the nice things we’d be doing because I was so convinced the plane was going to crash that it made me sad to consider what I surely wouldn’t experience.Imagine, then, my joy when the plane didn’t actually crash and I ended up not dying. What a bonus!And I went in the sea and didn’t drown — another nice surprise.I almost look forward to the moment when I do croak. If I have any warning I’ll tut and say to myself, “Oh well, I knew this would happen sooner or later.”This kind of attitude is admittedly a disaster when it comes to wooing women. Assuming total failure ahead of any move made on the opposite sex is disastrous. It’s just not attractive.I’ve a friend who simply cannot imagine why any woman in the world wouldn’t desire him.Consequently, many women do desire him. I, on the other hand, simply cannot imagine why any woman would desire me. Consequently, they invariably don’t. But because I knew they wouldn’t, I’m not remotely downhearted.I’ve kept the company of positive people over the years. They have their uses. But expecting me to believe them when they say, “Don’t worry, it’ll all be fine”, is fanciful.And believing that from professional advisers can be absolutely calamitous.“Oh yes, Adrian, it’s all going to be fine.” And then, whatever it is, turns out not to be fine and they just shrug and say, “Oh dear, didn’t see that coming, pay me some more fees and I’ll make sure it’ll be all right in the end.”In my work as a journalist I’ve talked to many psychologists who speak of the power of positive thinking. Yeah, whatever. Maybe. But what I do know for sure is that I just can’t do it.When you’re standing on a golf course with a club in your hand addressing the ball, you’re supposed to envisage your perfect shot. For me, impossible.What I actually envisage, with complete clarity, is a truly dreadful shot.I can actually hear the ball smacking on to trees, or plopping into water. I’m living in the calamity.So at least when it happens, which is often, I can shrug and say, “Hmm, thought so.”All this may stem from supporting a team like West Bromwich Albion. I once told a priest, in all seriousness, that I suffered from deep despondence.When he asked me why I thought this was, I told him (as a joke) who I supported. He nodded gravely and said, “Yes, I see, I see.”I have a friend I travel with on the supporters’ coaches to away matches. The poor chap always thinks we’re going to win. Even at 2-0 down at half-time he’ll be sure we’ll emerge victorious.I challenged him once about these absurd delusions and he said: “Look, we all have the same journey home after a game. If we’ve won we’re both happy, if we lose we’re both sad. The difference is that I’ve had a much more enjoyable journey there than you.”That convinced me for a while. So the next game I tried being positive.And we lost. And it hurt more. So I went back to how I was.There’s only one route to happiness I can think of and it’s to be found in the lyrics of a song by the late Mose Allison: “I don’t worry ’bout a thing, ’cos I know nothing’s going to be alright.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in those days — the late Seventies — it was rare and unrecognised.We lost touch a long time ago, but I thought of Sarah this week when I read that the number of teenage girls self-harming has doubled in the past 20 years.According to new NHS data, the number of hospital admissions for girls who have self-harmed has jumped from 7,327 in 1997 to 13,463 last year. For boys, the figures have stayed almost the same — from 2,236 then to 2,332 now.Worse, “self-poisoning” — as in taking an overdose — is rising for both genders and last month the Government released a green paper that said around 850,000 children and young people now have a diagnosable mental health condition.Experts say academic pressure is a contributory factor, so too social media.Kids have always had exams to cope with but in the old days jealous and bitter remarks were confined to the dark corners of secret conversations or, at worst, scrawled on a toilet wall.Now these brave warriors have a keyboard and pseudonym behind which they can troll you for everyone to see.By my age, you know the vitriol probably comes from a bitter, 53-year-old virgin who lives in his mother’s spare bedroom. But when you’re still finding your way in the world, that poisonous undermining can worm its way inside your head and chip away at the confidence that acts as an armour in life.One self-harmer told me the pain of cutting his skin provided a welcome distraction from the “washing machine” rotations of negative thoughts constantly disturbing his peace of mind.The majority of them can be helped if it is spotted early enough and the expert assistance they need is then easy to access. And therein lies the problem.In 2016, Theresa May said the mental health of children was to be one of her priorities as PM, but since then Brexit has taken over and little has changed.The Government’s strategy is to train more teachers to spot the signs, appoint 7,000 more specialists to child mental health units and cut the waiting time for non-critical cases to be seen.But even if it happens, it won’t be enough.Parents must also remain vigilant for any marked change in their child’s personality or behaviour and the big social media companies have the technology to stop the majority of trolls — so they should be forced to use it.If all of the above doesn’t happen, the NHS has another mental health time bomb coming which will cost the taxpayer a fortune and have an even greater cost to the mental well-being of the next generation.WHEN TV baker Paul Hollywood started dating a 23-year-old barmaid from his local pub, they were quick to point out that their relationship only started after his marriage to wife Alex ended.But Alex is reportedly not buying this explanation and is planning to name Summer Monteys-Fullam in her £10million divorce battle.Whatever the truth, it remains the case that many couples conveniently consider only full sexual intercourse as adultery.But of course, cosy chats, lingering touches and come-hither looks are all it takes for any man with a wandering eye to recognise that, should he wish to jump ship, there’s a shiny new model waiting in the wings to rev up his sex life.Hallelujah for the wonderfully pragmatic Emma Thompson who, when asked about her marriage to the dreamily handsome Greg Wise, replied that they have had plenty of rough times.The secret to a happy relationship, she says, is the realisation that there will be unhappy times and that, if you manage to amble through to the other side: “It’s always better.”She adds: “I think people in long, happy marriages tell a lot of fibs, like, ‘Yes, it’s been marvellous’, whereas I say, ‘Sometimes it has been awful’.”If a relationship is deeply unhappy for a sustained period then, of course, get the hell out.But in these Tinder times of endlessly sweeping left in search of the “perfect” mate (who doesn’t exist) it’s invaluable when someone high profile points out that, more often than not, sticking with the one you’ve got works out in the end.Altogether now, “Love is a decision, not just a feeling.”Daisy-May Demetres smile lights up a room.Just eight years old, she was born without her lower legs and now uses two prosthetic blades that allow her to live as full a life as possible.She attends mainstream school, loves PE and has just been given a modelling contract with high street brand River Island.Yet, because of her disability, her parents Alex and Claire admit to feeling a “profound sadness” the day she was born and asked themselves what they had done wrong. And when, as a toddler, Daisy-May had to endure a painful, eight-hour operation on her stumps, Alex admits he turned to alcohol and gambling in a bid to numb his feelings of hopelessness.But by the time she was four, Daisy-May had mastered her blades and was doing cartwheels and headstands.Alex, 35, from Birmingham, says: “I looked at her and thought, ‘If you can achieve so much, against all the odds, and still be cheerful, then I have no reason at all to be depressed’. I stopped gambling and drinking that day.”While no one would wish disability on their child, the Demetres’ story is a salutary lesson that, sometimes, what seems like insurmountable adversity through an adult’s eyes can, through a child’s simple acceptance and joie de vivre, enrich your life and give it deeper meaning.Following a cyber attack in Alaska, government officials have abandoned their computers and taken to using old-fashioned typewriters.Let joy be unconfined.I still have my original typewriter from my days as a junior reporter on the Solihull News and it was a loyal servant that never crashed, froze or ran out of battery. I may even request for it to be buried with me.It seems that my love for these machines is rivalled only by Tom Hanks (yes, that one) who has written a book of short stories about them and created an app called the Hanx Writer, which emulates the glorious click-clack sound as you type.Go on, try it. There’s no greater pleasure.No? Just me then...Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’re losing more and more of our natural wildlife. Our open spaces diminish daily.And now the Government is being forced into building countless millions of homes. Why?We’re told we have a housing crisis. You might find this puzzling when you consider the birth rate in Britain has been dropping, not rising.The answer, of course, is immigration. We’ve been letting in half a million people every year for almost 15 years.The politicians try to tell you it’s nothing to do with our housing crisis — but they are lying. Lying to themselves and to you.One top academic expert, Oxford demographer David Coleman, reckons immigration is 85 per cent responsible for the rise in the UK’s population between 2000 and 2015.And the other figures you might find a bit chilling.Did you know, for example, that a whopping 28 per cent of all births in the UK are to foreign-born women? And the figure in London is a staggering 60 per cent.If you find an indigenous British person in London, say hello to him for me and wish him the best. He’s the last of a dying breed. White Brits are a minority in our capital.It’s not just that. The birth rate for British people is 1.75. The birth rate for immigrants is 2.06. That’s a very big difference.So not only do we let in half a million per year, but they have more kids and so doubly contribute to population growth and the need for new houses.Oh, and the need for lots of other very expensive stuff, such as schools, hospitals, welfare benefits and so on.We MUST call a halt to immigration. The overwhelming majority of the population thinks we need much tougher controls.And there are many people who think that immigration has not made the country any better, but actually made it worse.Cut the numbers coming in to 10,000 per year and our housing crisis would begin to lessen, given that 300,000 or so people emigrate every year.A net decrease in the population would massively reduce the need for new housing.Because unless we do that, the bulldozers will be moving in. The fields, hedges and woodland will be ripped up. The roads will be laid and the peace and quiet shattered.And this will not be a green and pleasant land for much longer.Katie Price has just managed to avoid being declared bankrupt.She’s been given three months to pay off a whole load of creditors, plus a whopping tax bill.Everyone seems shocked that she has apparently blown £45million.But that body needs a lot of upkeep. She spends thousands every month getting her nails done so they look really chavvy.And then there’s the periodic scaffolding required to keep those vast mammaries aloft – plus a bit of pointing and retiling.The surprise to me was how in the name of hell she managed to amass £45million, not how she managed to spend it.For doing WHAT exactly?A woman on a flight from Valencia to London apparently “bonded” with a “hot guy”.Now Jo Lia has launched a Facebook campaign to trace the poor bugger.She says he was called “Joe” and looked a bit like Jordan Henderson. Hmmm. But can he pass the ball sideways just as well? I bet she didn’t find that out. Anyway, above is a photo of Ms Lia.So Joe, mate – keep your head down and stay off social media for a while. If I had that loon sitting next to me on a plane I’d spend the entire flight in the khazi.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn appeared on the Iranian-run Press TV to cast doubt on Israel’s right to exist.He used to get paid handsomely for his appearances on a network run by a hostile government which enslaves its own people.Meanwhile, more Labour anti-Semites have been crawling out of the woodwork.Here’s a suggestion. Clearly Labour has no intention of kicking out its Jew-haters.So I would suggest everyone in the party who ISN’T anti-Semitic get the hell out right now.And leave the party to the racist, hard-left rabble who are currently running it.The broadcaster Sandi Toksvig says that people mistake her for Tom Cruise.It’s easy to see why, isn’t it? Spitting image.Oddly enough, people often mistake me for the model Chloe Ayling.I even had the police round when she went missing because someone reckoned they’d seen her in Thornaby. But it was just me, nipping out for some fags.Our former Foreign Secretary is in trouble for having said that Muslim women wearing the full burka look like postboxes, or bank robbers.But that’s pretty much what most think, isn’t it?Boris was against banning the burka. But increasingly I think we should follow most of our European friends and outlaw the ridiculous garment in public places.Almost half of British 18 to 24 year olds don’t know when World War One took place, according to a survey.And hardly any of them could name the prime minister – David Lloyd George – who led us to victory.But it’s not really their fault, is it? Truth is, they’re not taught stuff like this any more.The history curriculum has been pretty much stripped of things which shows Britain in a good light, or British people being the victims of aggression.Instead, they learn very dubious arguments about slavery and colonialism.It’s a dangerous thing. When you lose a sense of pride in your nation, you also start to lose respect for its authority and its laws.And you raise a generation of perpetually whining airheads who understand nothing of the sacrifices made by Britons in the past.YOU see? They take their dieting really seriously up here in the North East. Pizza, chicken and chips. My missus took this pic, above, in a Teesside café.She once spent two weeks trying to find a salad in Austria, with no luck.The BBC is about to spend more than two million quid on a propaganda campaign to make you pay its licence fee.This is as opposed to the rest of its budget, which is spent on a propaganda campaign to convince you that all immigration is good, Israel is evil and Brexit a catastrophe.Fewer and fewer people watch the BBC.The licence fee has become an absurdity – an unjust tax which growing numbers of people simply refuse to pay.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’d never want authorities to have a free pass to snoop into our lives.But when cops are confident that the missing piece to a case can be found online, it is outrageous that web giants don’t work with them to investigate.They act as if they’re above the law.Let’s see about that.THE new Civil Society Strategy is better than its clunky name suggests.As a general rule, putting power in the hands of local people — rather than leaving it with far-off Whitehall civil servants — is usually a good idea.It is residents who know which roads need fixing, which bins need collecting, and which social care services are struggling.And for all the know-how of local councillors, too many are in safe seats and not solely motivated by serving their voters.Between plans for “citizen juries” and freeing up cash for community organisations, this should be a much-needed boost for local democracy — with the cash to back positive initiatives.The ironic thing is that it all sounds very familiar.It used to be called the Big Society.DAVID Jason reckons Del Boy would have been relaxed about Brexit.Of course he would.

After the British people voted to leave the European Union we were told “Brexit means Brexit” and that critical “red lines” would guide our negotiations with the EU. So far, so good.Fast forward to today and we live in a different world. The so-called Chequers Agreement crosses all those red lines.We are dancing the hokey cokey with the Customs Union and Single Market, which means restricting our freedom for new free trade agreements.These, of course, are critical to the national economic success of Brexit. European regulations will remain in force — with no input from the UK. So we stay under the rule of European courts and provide a back door for continued freedom of movement for EU nationals into Britain.Our laws and courts will not be supreme as Chequers would leave us being run by remote control from Brussels.To frighten us into submission we are spoon-fed a daily diet of tales of food shortages, soldiers in the streets and tailbacks from Dover to Land’s End.But the political graveyards are full of people who underestimated the good sense of the British people, the very people who want to be in command of their own destiny and who don’t want to be taken advantage of by the EU.And don’t forget that despite Project Fear in the referendum, the majority still voted to Leave and the fear-mongering was proven false.So false that the fear of recession and job losses was met by a growing economy, UK manufacturing output growing at its fastest rate in a decade, exports to the US in 2016 exceeding £100billion — more than twice as much as exports to any other country — and the fact that our economy is worth more than £2trillion and is the sixth largest in the world.Project Fear was proven false and so will this latest version of fear, which speaks volumes about what the Government thinks of voters — sheep to frighten into the right pen. But sheep we are not.I’ve spent the past few weeks meeting party activists, businesses and the public, supporters of Leave and Remain from across the country and the view is that Chequers will give us neither our economic nor political freedom.Their concerns are simple. There can be no halfway house, where Britain continues to be out of Europe in name but is still run by Europe.There can be no halfway house when it comes to rule-taking and law-making from the EU, and there is an overwhelming sense of frustration that Britain is being taken advantage of by the EU.And across the heartlands of the UK this matters, as these people are the ones who have been left behind and who are desperate to take back control of our laws, our borders and our money. There will also be long-term consequences if the largest democratic vote in British history is frustrated.We will face a crisis of democracy in which ordinary people will utterly lose their faith and trust in politics and in politicians. The implications for political parties at the polls when they fail to deliver is clear, the public will stop voting for them. We cannot ignore the people.The Conservative Party could throw away hard-won gains in pro-Leave constituencies across the North East and Midlands if we continue to compromise on the referendum and concede ground to Brussels.Across Europe we have seen political parties and governments do exactly that and the result is a wave of terrifying extreme forms of nationalism and populism. That is not the British way because when our governments deliver, they deliver for our country and our people.The time has come for our political leaders to believe in Britain and in the British people. They should abandon the weak-kneed approach and instead play to our strengths. Britain wants to secure a trade deal with the EU and seeks to establish a “strong and special partnership” with them.Talk of no deal really means no trade deal, and if the EU fails to reach a free trade agreement with Britain, in the long term we can thrive under World Trade Organisation rules. The UK exports to 111 countries under WTO rules and over the past 23 years this grew at a rate which was three times faster than those exporting to the major EU nations.We also know that the European Commission, thanks to the many political problems across the European Union, desperately needs British taxpayers to foot the “exit payment” of £39billion to balance its budget.And 1.2million EU jobs depend on selling goods to Britain, with London providing much-needed financing to EU businesses. Brexit will not be easy.There is hard work to do but we are up to the task. We are a free and independent country and will prosper if given a proper chance.But to let the British lion roar again the first step is to chuck Chequers.The Prime Minister assures us freedom of movement will end and that we’ll be able to do trade deals. Others, including former Cabinet ministers such as Ms Patel, believe otherwise.It is time for the Prime Minister to sell the Chequers deal directly to the country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong attitude.Still - while they only dine in the best restaurants and holiday in the coolest destinations - how they can afford such incredible lifestyles is largely a mystery.Most of their accounts are private and they rarely go into what their families do to fund their globe-trotting, designer existences.But there have been young Central Asians who have openly flaunted their status and wealth on the world stage.They included glamorous billionaire Gulnara Karimova, the fashion designer daughter of late Uzbek dictator Islam Karamov, who disappeared from public view in 2014.She was often pictured next to A-listers including Jude Law and her designs featured at New York Fashion week until they ditched her over human rights abuses.Gulnara, always dressed in couture dresses and glimmering jewellery, also released a single and was known to have sung a duet with Latin heartthrob Julio Iglesias.Meanwhile, the son of former Kyrgyzstan president, is reported to live in a £3.5million mansion in Surrey while 31 per cent of his compatriots live below the poverty line.He was forced to flee the country in April 2010 after his father Kurmanbek Bakiyev was toppled following bloody nationwide riots.Maxim was so hated that protesters burned down his restaurant and luxury home in Bishkek the day after he left to seek asylum in the UK."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425856204.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"photos abandoned mansion wales","story":"Crumbling walls, collapsed ceilings and dilapidated grounds, these grand houses, hospitals and halls are a shadow of what they once were. Many of these buildings are now overgrown, while some still have discarded scaffolding surrounding them.But all of these buildings are in urgent need of TLC.Here are some of Wales forgotten gems:The Mid Wales Hospital, originally the Brecon and Radnor Joint Counties Lunatic Asylum, was a psychiatric hospital in Talgarth, Wales.It opened in 1903 and was one of more than 100 lunatic asylums in Britain with the last ward shut in 1999.The hospital was also home to the Mid and West Wales College of Nursing and Midwifery and an alcohol and drug abuse clinic.There have been many failed plans to redevelop the site.Hafodunos Hall is a Gothic revival house near the village of Llangernyw in Wales.It was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott and built between 1861 and 1866 for Henry Robertson Sandbach.The grand hall was subject to a devastating fire in 2004 and the ruins are being restored.It is a Grade I listed building, with many of the buildings and structures in the grounds having their own listings.Clawdd Manor in Newport was owned by the Lyne family until the death of Colonel Cecil Lyne in 1979.The Edwardian building was then a successful B\u0026ampB before it started to fall apart.Baron Hill is in Beaumaris, Anglesey, and it fell into disrepair during World War I as the family couldnt afford to maintain the house.During the English Civil War, Richard Bulkeleys successor, Colonel Thomas Bulkeley, is said to have invited King Charles I to take possession of the house and set up his court there.Interestingly, parts of the park are sites of special scientific interest because the woodland has remained undisturbed for so long.It has a large range of lichen.This majestic castle in Abergele was built between 1819 and 1825 - and it has direct links to the British Royal Family.It was left to King George V by the Countess of Dundonald following her death in 1924.But local history claims that the first castle at Gwrych was built by the Normans in the 12th century.The castle was last open to the public in 1985 and has now been bought by the Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust, which plans to restore it and open it to the public. The spooky looking Piercefield House -  located at St Arvans, in the Monmouthshire countryside - was built in the late 1700s.It was designed by British architect John Soane, who is the same man behind the Bank of England building.Iscoed, at Ferryside in Carmarthenshire, is a ruined eighteenth century mansion, which was listed for auction earlier this year.The crumbling mansion was designed by architect Anthony Keck.It was built for Sir William Mansel in 1772 and purchased by the Napoleonic general Sir Thomas Picton in 1812 - it remained in the family until the end of World War One.It was then used as council housing, but has been empty since the 1950s.This grand castle was one of the first of the mock castles to be built in Wales.It was built in 1626 by Sir Thomas Morgan, Steward to the Earl of Pembroke.And King Charles I spent two nights at Ruperra Castle in 1645, shortly after the Battle of Naseby.In September 2010, Ashraf Barakat put the building up for sale - at a whopping price of £1.5million - and the castle was sold in July 2014.This derelict house is in Llanychaer in Pembrokeshire.Despite its dilapidated exterior, its roof is intact.Richard Fenton described the house as “a handsome modern mansion” in the 1811 Tour of Pembrokeshire book.The grand Cornist Hall is a large house west-southwest of the town of Flint.It was the birthplace in 1746 of Thomas Totty, an admiral who served under Lord Nelson, including on  HMS Invincible.Most recently, it was used as a dining and wedding venue - until it closed its doors in 2013.Unfortunately, the site is often vandalised."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425907372.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"muslim convert admits planning massacre 100 people on oxford street disney","story":"Lewis Ludlow, 26, carried out reconnaissance on a number of possible targets, including Oxford Street and tourist hotspot Madame Tussauds.Ludlow, who pleaded guilty in court, even wrote down the places he was considering to attack before ripping the notes up and throwing them away.The sites he was considering included Madame Tussauds, Oxford Street -

Without sight of the report the family has no answer to these questions.He also said possible evidence over whether disciplinary proceedings were brought against police officers in Poland over Mr Spiers death should be heard at the inquest.Science fiction writer Monika Duvall, a friend who Mr Bates had reportedly been living with at the time of his death, was also asked to attend the inquest.Speaking afterwards, his mum Vanessa Bates said: I did not expect him to go to Poland and not come back.He should be here. He was very fit and healthy when I said goodbye to him. I miss him dreadfully.She added: I think when we get to the inquest we will know more about whether police procedures were or were not followed.I think it is going to be very difficult to get the Polish witnesses over here.Its been a long time coming, but Im just relieved that at last something is happening and there is a proper investigation and inquest.After Mr Spiers body was repatriated to the UK, doctors at a Margate hospital were unable to determine the cause of his death. An initial inquest in Canterbury opened in December 2016 when the court heard he vomited two litres of black fluid, but the inquest was adjourned last year.The court heard Mr Spiers had been on holiday was a friend in Cyprus before heading to Poland where he was speaking at a conference.Shortly before his death, Mr Spiers was said to have been probing into the lives of well-known figures in politics, business and entertainment.At the time his mum Vanessa said she feared the worst: I think Max had been digging in some dark places and somebody wanted him dead.Her theory was shared by many online, with other conspiracy theorists, UFO investigators and bloggers calling the circumstances of Mr Spiers death suspicious.At the time, Coroner Alan Blunsdon told the court he was still awaiting a report from Polish authorities, adding that the workload of Kent Police may delay forensic analysis of Mr Spiers phone and computer.Coroner Christopher Sutton Mattocks set the date of January 7 for the four-day inquest, which will be heard at the Archbishops Palace in Maidstone.He said: It is extremely important that when we start everybody is completely ready for this and we have all the information available."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425530294.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"heatwave and world cup combine economy","story":"Higher household spending helped overcome a worrying fall in exports and a manufacturing recession.And business investment rose despite fears of a crash in confidence due to the Brussels deadlock.The ONS said growth hit 0.4 per cent in the three months to June – against 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The World Cup, the Royal Wedding and warm weather got consumers spending on beers and barbecues.“But higher energy bills and petrol prices, and a backdrop of weak wage growth, suggests the shackles are still on the UK economy.” Others warned growth was “anaemic”.The trade deficit widened from £4.7billion to £8.6billion in the three months to May on a notable fall in exports to non-EU nations.Chancellor Philip Hammond insisted the Government wasn’t complacent.He announced a £1billion business innovation fund to generate more high-tech jobs on a visit to Coventry.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the country was paying the price for Tory austerity.He stormed: “Councils are going bankrupt and the NHS is in permanent crisis while holidaymakers are being hit by the Pound.

as theyll be ferrying people between Las Vegas McCarran International Airport and the military base.He or she will be expected to order changes in fuel supply, load and route and must have a minimum of 3,000 fixed wing flying hours within the past five years.And if all that wasnt enough the money may be what clinches it because, according to salary research site Glassdoor, the average wage for a pilot at AECOM is $80,454 (£63,000) a year.The exact purpose of the air base is not known publicly, and the area is heavily restricted.Trespassers can face huge fines and lengthy prison sentences for setting foot in the zone.Purchased by the US government in 1955, evidence suggests the site is used as a testing area for experimental aircraft and weapons.But the secrecy surrounding it has led conspiracy theorists to suggest the area is holding extra-terrestrial secrets.Theories suggest engineers examine crashed spacecrafts — and even hold meetings with aliens from across the galaxy.The crash of a weather balloon at Roswell, New Mexico in 1947 sparked wild theories of an alien ship crash.Some have suggested Area 51 is still storing parts of the crashed ship — or even its alien inhabitants.Located 100 miles north of Las Vegas in Nevada, Area 51 it is classified as a US military installation.The patch of fenced off land, measuring six by ten miles, is tucked between a US Air Force base and an abandoned nuclear testing ground.For years the US government denied it even existed, but in 2013 the CIA officially acknowledged its existence and its location was revealed."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000418324138.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"philip hammond backs brexit plan","story":"Only a day after ex-Cabinet Minister Priti Patel launched a blistering assault on the plan and warned the deal would cost Tory seats, Philip Hammond branded it a “pragmatic” way out of the deadlock with Brussels.He claimed it would allow the UK to remain closely connected to the European economy in a way that worked for both sides.But the former Aid Secretary ripped into the deal saying voters may never forgive the party for conceding powers to Brussels.It followed Trade Secretary Liam Fox’s warning “intransigence” on the EU side meant there was now a 60-40 chance Britain would crash out without a deal.European Commission’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, has already kicked into touch a key element of the proposals for a “facilitated customs arrangement”.He said the EU would not accept anything which undermined the integrity of the single market.But the PM is under extreme pressure from Tory Brexiteers who argue the plan for a “common rule book” for trade in goods would restrict Britain’s ability to strike free trade agreements around the world.But Mr Hammond insisted Chequers was the only “sensible” option.He said: “Getting a deal with the European Union that allows our businesses to continue accessing the European market is clearly in our best interest.“I believe that the Chequers White Paper represents the best way forward.“It is a fair and sensible and pragmatic offer to the Europeans that will allow us to deliver on the result of the referendum -

That’s one of the great pull factors.“Leaving the EU, we should not be offering for people to come over here just looking for work and to claim benefits.“We need a living wage that does not require people to come over here and claim benefits to top up.”But CBI deputy director-general Josh Hardie rejected Mr Duncan Smith’s assessment.He said: “The suggestion that British businesses do not even bother to look at British workers to fill roles is wholly detached from reality and needlessly provocative to the thousands of firms across the UK facing labour and skills shortages.“Businesses are trying to have a balanced, honest debate about a new immigration system for the UK.“We need to build this model from facts, not fantasy.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, I was wrong about the messy divorce.Bam! This week Angelina claimed that Brad wasn’t paying her enough child support.Kapow! He hit back that he has coughed up over £7million since they first split over 18 months ago.Sock! Angelina then put the boot in by saying that most of the money was just a loan that she’s having to pay back with interest.Wham! He claims she wants to manipulate the media into branding him a deadbeat dad.It once again proves that no one knows what’s going on inside someone else’s marriage.It might look perfect bliss on the outside, but we have no idea what tense battles are being fought on a daily basis behind closed doors.Despite us all being spoon-fed stories of their perfect relationship over the years, and shown photos of their wedding when the children drew pictures on Angelina’s beautiful white dress, it appears that this relationship has been on the rocks for quite some time.Brad’s friends claim she is fired up with anger over the custody battle and doesn’t want the children to have any sort of relationship with their father.They have slammed her for going public instead of having the divorce hammered out in front of a private judge.Her friends counterclaim that he drank too much and was “rough” with one of the children, thought to be Maddox, the eldest, while they were on a private plane.He was cleared of any wrongdoing, but mud sticks and this was highly damaging as well as deeply distressing for Brad.These two extremely gifted, pampered, beautiful people might have met on a movie set and become infatuated with each other, but this is not a film.This is real life and there are six bewildered youngsters caught up in the eye of the storm.There’s the aforementioned Maddox, 17, then Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and ten-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox.Shiloh and the twins are the biological children of Brad and Angelina, but they have all been brought up to think of themselves as full brothers and sisters, and just one big family.So it must now be extremely unsettling for them to see all the news reports about custody fights and money squabbles, and to have witnessed friends of their parents forced into taking sides.I have no idea whether the children witnessed any arguments or screaming matches between their parents, but there surely must have been an uncomfortable atmosphere at home in the months before the split.The poor, wee children actually have their own psychiatrists that Brad’s friends claim he pays for.And they have round-the-clock bodyguards available.As with so many splits, money has reared its ugly head, and despite their enormous wealth (it’s estimated that Brad is worth £202million and that Angelina has a personal fortune of £125million) it would appear that it’s all coming down to cold, hard cash.We are a long, long way from the heady Brangelina days when they were the world’s sexiest couple and couldn’t keep their hands off each other.Sadly, most white-hot affairs tend to fizzle out when domesticity kicks in and you need to change nappies and wipe snot from little faces.Even with a team of nannies, six children running around is probably one of the biggest passion killers of all time.So, it’s a real shame that Brad and Angelina couldn’t make it work, but sadder still that their dirty washing is being aired for all the world to see.But theirs is not the only love story to turn rancid . . .ROMEO and Juliet ended in tragedy at the end of Gone With The Wind, Rhett tells Scarlett that he doesn’t give a damn

guzzle.Apparently they nod wisely when we solemnly declare that we have but one small sherry on a Sunday night while watching Songs of Praise, and then they simply double whatever we say or put down a number that seems most likely.New info this week says that just 40 per cent of patients tell the truth to their GPs when it comes to how much they drink every week.Frankly, I’m astonished the figure is that high.Most of us play down our booze intake and exaggerate the amount of exercise we do, but even as we are telling such huge porkies, we all know in our hearts that our doctors aren’t the least bit fooled.We want them to think we are model citizens and that our bodies are temples, but in the long run we need to tell the truth so we can get a proper diagnosis and treatment.And always bear in mind you can’t kid a kidder.There are lots of doctors who overindulge and they know all the tricks and cover-ups.IT’S the final episode of The Handmaid’s Tale tomorrow night, and I will be

viewing, but Elisabeth Moss has been mesmerising throughout as June, whose first child was ripped from her arms, and whose newborn baby was also taken away from her.I’m bracing myself for an emotional

feisty and fiercely intelligent Lois Lane in the original Superman movies, died by suicide.Margot’s death happened back in May, but it was revealed this week that she died as a rfesult of a “self-inflicted drug and alcohol overdose”.The 69-year-old suffered from depression and other mental health issues, which became worse after a car accident in 1990 left her wheelchair-bound for almost two years and facing mounting debts.She had a very tough time but she tried hard to sort out her life and cope with her illness.We should remember her in her heyday.I loved the fact she wasn’t a conventional glamour puss at a time when any actress playing the “love interest” in an action movie was usually a busty blonde doing little more than squeaking and waiting to be rescued.Lois Lane was a kick-ass reporter who adored Superman but also made fun of him during four movies between 1978 and 1987.Those films had real heart and soul and – if you ignore the rather wobbly special effects – are far more entertaining than many of the over-long, over-loud and rather self-important superhero movies of today.I’M no fan of his, but I don’t think Boris Johnson should be forced to apologise for

uttering that particular view in public and instead will voice it in private.And that, in my opinion, is far more dangerous.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250

The Egyptian floated the business on the stock market again nine years later, minus Harrods, which had been its most valuable asset.By the late 1990s, struggling to compete with the new out-of-town shopping outlets that had lured shoppers away from the traditional high street locations from which it traded, House of Fraser was labouring under heavy debts.The solution of John Coleman, its chief executive at the time, was to strike a deal in July 1999 that saw the freeholds of 15 of the group\u0027s stores sold and then leased back.Unfortunately, a store freehold can only be sold once and the sale-and-leaseback agreement tied House of Fraser into some onerous rental agreements, some of which went out 40 years.In the meantime, the group continued to be a consolidator in the sector, snapping up rivals such as Beatties, the Midlands department store operator and Jenners, based in Edinburgh.Some, like Jenners and Dickins \u0026 Jones, have retained their names but, along the way, other famous old brands owned by House of Fraser have been replaced with the latter brand.The last Army \u0026 Navy stores, for example, were rechristened House of Fraser in 2005 stores previously trading under the name Binns, largely in the North East of England, were nearly all rebranded by 2006 and DH Evans was rebranded as long ago as 2001. These rebrandings in many cases severed a link between the stores and communities in which they had traded for many years and confused older shoppers.The next chapter came when, in 2006, House of Fraser was bought by the Icelandic group Baugur. The latter went bust three years later, in the wake of the financial crisis and the collapse of Iceland\u0027s economy, with Baugur\u0027s shares being scattered among a group of Icelandic banks.By then House of Fraser was in the middle of a turnaround under John King, the former Matalan boss, who had joined in early 2007 and Don McCarthy, an experienced retailer who became chairman under Baugur.But in 2013, the business changed hands again, being bought by the Chinese retailer Sanpower for a remarkable \u0026#163480m. Mr McCarthy left almost immediately and the talented Mr King, who had been promised the chairmanship by the new owners, left at the beginning of 2015 when that pledge went unfulfilled.The Chinese have proved to be as poor owners of House of Fraser as Mr Fayed was. Promised investment has never materialised, experienced managers have left the business and the group was left in no fit state to face either the hurricanes buffeting the high street or the intensification of competition as both John Lewis and Debenhams sought to respond to changing consumer tastes."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/16/12/2048x1152/326a125acce6f0e546603d03d3901f84d3e9ccb3a6ef953b1394158ef434619e_3848357.jpg?20170303130734 ","title":"mike ashleys sports direct buys house of fraser for 90m","story":"Details of Mr Ashley\u0027s plans for HoF, including how many of the 17,500 people who work for the company and its concession operators will keep their jobs, are unclear.However, a rescue deal by a well-capitalised business like Sports Direct will at least preserve a significant number of jobs at HoF.More than 6,000 roles had already been earmarked to be lost as part of a controversial process which was subject to a now-settled legal challenge from some of HoF\u0027s landlords.HoF had planned to close 31 of its 59 stores but because it entered administration those controversial Company Voluntary Arrangements (CVAs), which allows companies to renegotiate contracts with creditors - and in this case landlords, drop away.Mr Ashley said: \"We will do our best to keep as many stores open as possible.

In April, Theresa May sent \u0026shygovernment commissioners into Northamptonshire County Council after it overspent by \u0026pound20million, saying the council wasn’t getting proper value for taxpayer money. In the three months since, the projected overspend for this year has jumped to \u0026pound70m – that’s 333% worse. And Theresa can’t blame profligate lefties because Northamptonshire has been blue since 2005. Tory maths meant this week \u0026shycouncillors met to decide whether to cut services for children or the \u0026shydisabled. County Hall is up for sale, the winter gritting fleet has been slashed, and 21 libraries need \u0026shyvolunteers to stay open. The local paper has revealed the council is a total of \u0026pound1BILLION in debt, and it’s not the only one.  East Sussex County Council has already warned it will have to reduce services to the legal minimum, and the National Audit Office said earlier this year that 1 in 10 local authorities would have burned through savings by 2021. Tory maths means Theresa won’t bail out Northamptonshire – which owes most of the debt to the \u0026shygovernment’s loan board anyway – because it means she would have to do the same for everyone. Yet this is a problem which affects some of the most important things in our lives – bins, roads, social care, schools and planning. Tory maths produced austerity, which multiplied by eight years means the local authorities that 65 million people rely on are now potless. But Tory maths means those already doing quite nicely get to do better. Bureaucrats at the Department for \u0026shyInternational Trade, which is in charge of post-Brexit trade deals, got bonuses totalling \u0026pound542,775 last year – without a single trade deal to show for it.

On Saturday, March 20, 1993, the day before Mother\u0027s Day, an IRA bomb exploded without warning in a rubbish bin in Warrington\u0027s Bridge Street shopping area. Three-year-old Jonathan Ball was killed instantaneously. Moments later a second bomb exploded, seriously injuring 50 people and claiming the life of another child, 12-year-old Tim Parry, who died in hospital five days later after his parents, Colin and Wendy, had to take the unimaginable step of turning off his life-support machine. The reaction worldwide to what happened in Warrington was one of revulsion and locally anger was directed at the Irish community. Across the Irish Sea, however, the anger manifested itself into something unexpected and uplifting and it forms the basis of a new BBC drama Mother\u0027s Day.  The killing of the two innocent boys was a step to far for many who by their silence had supported the armed struggle. At the time Susan McHugh, then 37, was an ordinary wife and mother living in Clontarf, Dublin. After hearing of the Warrington tragedy, she said she felt the impulse to pick up the phone to book a hall at Trinity College, Dublin and later announced on the radio phone-in Liveline the holding of a protest meeting. She voiced her indignation as an Irish citizen about what had been committed in her name She asked people to join her at a public meeting at TCD on March 24 - 1,000 attended.  Her rallying speech At the time, the mum of two said: The IRA did not kill Johnathan Ball in my name or in your name. I want to tell the world tonight they did not kill him in the name of Ireland. There\u0027s nothing wrong with being emotional about a little baby\u0027s death. I feel horror, revulsion and sadness. But that\u0027s not enough. Tonight I feel anger. I feel angry and frustrated because the political will is not there to end the violence. We\u0027ve listened too long to rhetoric with no results. Sincere people will say everything has been tried. Maybe it\u0027s time it was looked at from a different angle.  Maybe it\u0027s time we asked for UN troops and independent arbitrators from Europe or the outside world. She appealed to politicians of all parties on both sides of the border. \u0027\u0027We demand an immediate peace plan . . . tonight is a night to remember,\u0027\u0027 she said. \u0027\u0027We, the silent majority, say enough is enough.\u0027\u0027 The peace rally A peace rally in O\u0027Connell Street followed, attended by 20,000 people. It was a pivotal moment the launch of the Peace Consensus and a demonstration of people power, as journalist Bernie Ni Fhlatharta put it, that would do something the politicians had failed to do: kick-start the peace process and ultimately remake the political landscape of Northern Ireland. Across the country scores of people signed books of condolence in churches around Ireland and thousands of bouquets of flowers were transported by the Irish Air Corps to the funeral of Jonathan Ball. At one rally McHugh shouted: Please, please, please, make it stop! She was cheered by grim-faced people standing near the post office in the rain, many wearing white ribbons for peace.  Enough is enough In an interview before the demonstration she said: I\u0027m only saying what the majority of people in the country say. Enough is enough. We don\u0027t want any more deaths. We want a cease-fire. At the time she was lionized by the media as the leader of a new peace movement, but she insisted: I\u0027m an ordinary mum, a housewife. It was a dramatic time as the world searched for an end to violence and is seen by some as the moment peace seemed within reach. A year later the IRA announced a ceasefire, it was not to last, but it was the beginning of the end. Is Mother\u0027s Day true?  Now a BBC drama Mother\u0027s Day will tell the story of McHugh, played by Vicky McClure (Line of Duty, The Replacement) and Wendy Parry, played by Anna Maxwell Martin (Motherland, Good Omens) the mother of 12 year old Tim Parry who lost his life in the attack.

The scouse mum-of-four has told passenger Mark Chassin to get a life after he claimed his family was relegated to seats at the back of the aircraft, directly in front of pungent toilets which put them off their food. Coleen added: I didn’t ask for certain seats, just took what I was given. I am just a mum traveling with young kids like everyone else. Mark, 51, paid a total of \u0026pound2,735 for a return flight from Manchester Airport to Faro in Portugal for a family holiday - including \u0026pound60 to secure their preferred seats. But the dad of one was stunned to find he had been moved when a member of cabin crew allegedly told him Coleen needed to sit with everyone in her party.  His partner Lynn Waterhouse, 52, managed to snap a picture of Coleen, the wife of ex-England football captain Wayne Rooney, sitting in the seats they had reserved. The financial director says he pre-booked the row of six seats on the July 28 flight in January specifically to avoid being sat near the loo after a previous bad experience.  He now alleges he, along with Lynn, his son Joshua, 15, dad Tom, 75, Lynn\u0027s sister Kathryn Pullar, 48, and her partner Richard Townend, 45, were treated differently to Coleen purely because he does not enjoy her celebrity status. But furious Coleen told her social media followers: The man who has gone to the press over this story...get a life, stop trying to pick on and drag down young women and their children. The man whose [sic] complaining with the very sarcastic attitude is trying to make me out as some diva... which I am far from... I didn\u0027t know about this situation.  A spokesperson for Jet2 said that Mark and his party were moved to the back row for \u0027safety and operational requirements\u0027 and that the company has given him a full refund for the seats. Coleen is believed to have been on a family holiday with her two brothers. The mum of Kai, eight, Klay, five, Cass, four, and Kit, two,was said to be completely unaware of the incident. Mark, from Denshaw, Greater Manchester, said: I booked the seats in January. We had a bad experience once of sitting near the toilets so we wanted to avoid that. Plus, we wanted to all be sat together. I went to print my boarding passes off about five weeks before and the seats were the same as what I had booked in the first place. I didn\u0027t find out we had been moved until we went to the check-in desk for our return journey. The lady on the check-in desk told us our seats had been changed and that we would have to have new boarding cards. She told us we had been moved to accommodate another passenger. I found it ridiculous. Unless it is for medical reasons or if a parent and child have been split up I don\u0027t understand why a whole row of us had to be moved for another passenger.  I spoke to one of the air hostesses and asked why we had been moved and she just pointed out that Coleen Rooney was on board and wanted all of her party to sit together. She had apparently booked a number of seats and wanted to be sat together. I was livid. We got on the plane and discovered we were near the toilets. It was fragrant.  The team on board were trying their best and spraying air freshener but it didn\u0027t do much. We couldn\u0027t eat any food like we normally would because the smell was just so bad. I\u0027m not sure if Jet2 wanted to put her there so she wasn\u0027t near the toilet, but it could be seen that way. But it was obvious that we were moved to purely to accommodate her party. I think there was at least two or three rows of her party.  There was no reason to move us as we had paid for the seats and if they moved us to an empty row why wasn\u0027t she put there? She should have hired her own plane if she wanted everyone to sit together. I don\u0027t know why she is more important than us. If it was anyone else they would\u0027ve been told the seats were already booked up. I\u0027m glad we weren\u0027t sat too near to them though as one of the kids was a bit of a monster. He was kicking the chair in front and throwing his iPad around. After the flight Mark emailed Jet2 to complain but claims he only received an automated response. He believes his posts on social media helped him receive a full refund on the cost of his pre-booked seats from Jet2. However, Mark still feels as though he hasn\u0027t been given a satisfactory explanation from the airline.  Mark said: I sent an email the Sunday I got home to Jet2, but I just received a generic response. I started posting about it on social media and then I got offered a refund. I haven\u0027t been given a proper explanation. I think it is awful that she is treated better than us. We had booked and paid for those seats so to be moved because of this isn\u0027t acceptable. A spokesperson for Jet2 said: The aisle seats on the back row of our aircraft must be occupied by passengers aged 14 or above, so this move was necessary for us to meet safety and operational requirements, whilst keeping Mark and his family on the same row.

The world famous UFO expert had vomited two litres of black liquid before he died when he was on a trip to Poland to attend a conference.  Mr Spiers\u0027s laptop was wiped when Polish authorities returned it after his death more than two years ago. Around the time of his death, it was said that he had been probing into the lives of well-known figures in politics, business and entertainment.  Alarm bells rang for his mum, Vanessa Bates, after she received a text which read: Your boy\u0027s in trouble, if anything happens to me, investigate. Today a pre-inquest review at Guildhall in Sandwich, Kent, heard how the contents of his SIM card were also of particular interest.  The barrister for Mr Spiers\u0027s mother, Adam Taylor, has called for members of the Polish emergency services to appear as witnesses in the inquest.  Mr Taylor stated that his laptop was wiped but that it was not empty at the time of his death.  His body was returned to the UK but his laptop and phone were held by Polish police. During that time, Ms Bates said: I think Max had been digging in some dark places and somebody wanted him dead. An initial inquest opened in December 2016 when the court heard he vomited the black fluid whilst he was in Poland after holidaying in Cyprus for a week. In a statement, coroner\u0027s investigations officer Caroline O\u0027Donnell said: When they returned, Mr Spiers became ill with a high temperature and was weak.  The following day, Mr Spiers vomited two litres of black fluid. The friend called a doctor who attempted resuscitation before pronouncing him dead.  Authorities in Poland also said that the bizarre death was due to natural causes. Doctors at a Margate Hospital were unable to determine the cause of his death.  He was heard slurring to other conspiracy theorists in Poland before he was found lifeless on a sofa. His girlfriend Sarah Adams, 31, from Kent, said the pair were due to get married and have a baby when he came back to England. She claimed he was forced to call her in secret after being held against his will in Warsaw.

Linda Carolan, 50, was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer seven years ago but last week was admitted to a critical care ward suffering from both pneumonia and sepsis .  A desperately sick Linda admitted to staff at Queen Alexandra hospital in Portsmouth her dying wish was to marry her partner Marcus Fellows, aged 46. Doctors were worried she wouldn’t survive so, determined to make her wish come true, ward staff rushed to organise a ceremony. Critical Care Consultant David Slessor contacted the local registry office and the team even went so far as to buy Linda a dress at a local charity shop and to decorate the area around her bedside.  Just hours after her prognosis, Mrs Fellowes - wearing a pink wedding dress - married her partner in a small ceremony on the ward with flowers, balloons and Prosecco. The couple, who live in West Meon, Petersfield, Hants, with their 12-year-old son, said staff at the hospital were “incredible”. Mr Fellowes said: “The doctor wrote a letter to the registry office and they said they could be at the hospital within the hour. “Staff went to a charity shop to buy Linda a nice dress while others went to buy Prosecco, balloons and decorations. “It was incredible what they did for us, they made it a massive celebration and everyone wanted to get involved and do their part. “Everyone was so jubilant and you could tell they were happy for us. “In the darkest moment of our lives, the hospital staff stepped in and helped in more ways than we could imagine. “Not only did they save Linda’s life but they fulfilled her last request.” Linda, now Mrs Fellows, saw a dramatic improvement in her health following the wedding and has not moved off intensive care to a respiratory ward.

But my husband would like to flip him one finger. We’re both delighted his \u0026pound90 million will save jobs. But that’s where our agreements end. Because while my great passion is shopping, his is Newcastle United. And he’s not a happy chappy. “Ashley coughed up a day after transfer deadline day, but didn’t spend a penny making sure Newcastle keep Rafa Benitez,” he harrumphed. The ensuing bickering saw both of us heatedly defend our great loves. I have always known Michael would choose Newcastle United over me. Not long into our romance, I held my breath and blushed as Michael said: “Julie, you know what I really, really love? “Newcastle United. But you’re a close second.”  I had to wait to see Newcastle’s fixtures list before we could set a date for our wedding. Then Michael insisted I changed the colour of my bridesmaids’ dresses which were red - the team colour of his nemesis Sunderland. “If I look up the aisle and see you in white and them in red, I’ll be sick.” We met 24 years ago when we were students in his native north east. Sweet memories of getting to know each other in our first year make me smile. Michael smiles too because it was the year Newcastle enjoyed their Kevin Keegan peak.  For the next three years I juggled studies and our dates with a part-time job in House of Fraser stores Binns. I worked in the toy department, getting paid to talk to cute kids and build Lego displays. And on a sweet kiosk, where staff could eat damaged stock. It’s pure coincidence Double Deckers were damaged on each one of my shifts. When I moved to full time employment I ploughed most of my wages back in to House of Fraser in Edinburgh’s Jenners, where I knew every backstairs and shortcut. Our three daughters don’t have time to share my love of shopping.

Children shout and scream with delight as it halts expectantly on the edge of the drop. As the only adult on the ride, surrounded by no one over the age of 10, I’m feeling a little silly. But as soon as the Cliffhanger rollercoaster takes the plunge, I forget all about that and I am transported back to when I was last at Blackgang Chine as a 10-year-old myself. The wacky and wonderful attraction, embedded on the stunning cliffs on the south of the island, celebrates its 175th birthday on Wednesday and is Britain’s oldest amusement park.  Despite my fellow passengers, Blackgang Chine is not just for children. Not wanting to grow up is a theme which runs deep through the park and its owner, Alec Dabell, whose great-great grandfather Alexander Dabell founded the park in 1843, is perfect proof of this. Alec may be in his late 50s, but he is like a real life Peter Pan. As he shows me around the park, I ask whether he likes to go on the rides. “Well of course, I have a go on the rides every morning,” he says with a grin, then quickly adds: “You’re not supposed to know that.”  Owning a theme park would be a dream job for many, but not for Alec. “Jobs are for grown-ups, this is not a job. I haven’t grown up yet, I’m not allowed to grow up. “If the park is not making me smile, if it’s not fun all the time, then is it going to make anyone else smile? “And if it’s not going to make them smile, then we’ve got it wrong.” Blackgang Chine gets its name from the blue slipper clay the lands rests upon, which can be quite muddy and black in colour. A “gang” means a walk way, while the Chine, a coastal ravine, has long since eroded away.  Alec said of Alexander: “It’s a shame he built the park on blue slipper clay – but I wouldn’t swap it for anywhere. “The Isle of Wight is the most beautifully varied 144 square miles this country has to offer. We are guilty of one thing, keeping it quiet.” The vision of Britain’s first theme park began when Alexander bought the carcass of a dead Fin whale that had been stranded off the Needles. He then decide to display the skeleton in Blackgang, formerly landscaped gardens designed to attract the first Victorian visitors. Soon more and more flocked to the park, including Queen Victoria and Albert, who Alec believes drew inspiration from the whale exhibition.  Standing beneath the huge skeleton, Alec says: “This is pure speculation, but Victoria came in 1853 and 20 years later London’s Natural History Museum arrived with a lot of input from them. And what was the first exhibit? A whale. “I wonder where they got that idea from! This is a wonder of nature. You could read about a whale and how big it was. But until you physically see it, you wouldn’t know. So that is what we did.” When Queen Mary visited in the 1920s, she bumped her head on the whale’s jawbone and it knocked her hat off. Within minutes a man appeared and sawed off the offending piece of bone.  Remarkably, Blackgang stayed open during both world wars. Alec says: “We had quite a lot damage because they’d bomb Southampton and Portsmouth and on the way back to France, get rid of all their bombs. “My grandmother told me the Luftwaffe came to bomb radar sites in Ventnor. “They flew right over Blackgang and she’d tell my father ‘get down and pretend to be a cow pat’ – so they don’t bomb you.” Blackgang is the third oldest theme park in the world after Bakken in Denmark, open in 1583 and Prater in Austria which dates from 1766. Alec adds: “The other two closed during the war so I’d argue we’re actually the oldest as we’ve been doing it continually for 175 years.” He shows me around its 44 acres, from the singing DoDo display and Cowboy Town to the Underwater Kingdom, with the enthusiasm of an excited eight-year-old. A favourite spot is Restricted Area 5, where a 25ft T-Rex roars at terrified kids.

Arthur King has lived through two world wars and read the paper for more than 80 years, doing the puzzle each day to keep his mind sharp. He said: “I’ve been reading the Daily Mirror since I was a young man. “I love it because it’s the best newspaper out there and it’s a Labour paper and the crossword is my favourite thing to do.”  On his 100th birthday his granddaughter gave the retired clerk an original Mirror from the day he was born – on August 8, 1913, when King George V was on the throne. And Arthur, who lives in Reading, Berks, even tried to do the crossword in that.  The dad-of-two – who served as an anti-aircraft gunner during the Second World War – said he has been a Labour Party supporter his whole life and the Daily Mirror is the only paper for him.  His parents James and Catherine were Mirror readers and Labour supporters too. “I couldn’t imagine reading anything else,” said Arthur.  “It’s what’s kept my mind so sharp all these years. I’ll read it and do the crossword until I die.” Arthur’s daughter, Wendy Levey, said: “He has been reading the Mirror for as long as I can remember, every day for probably more than 80 years. “Every day he has it delivered and sits down to make his way through it. “Dad’s not quite as good as he used to be at completing the crosswords, but he gives it his best effort, which at 105 I think is all you can ask for. “He likes it because he’s been a Labour supporter his whole life and it’s a Labour newspaper. Dad still pays his Labour membership to this day. “His eyes aren’t what they used to be, but I think the crossword keeps his mind sharp. “On his 100th birthday, my daughter managed to get a copy of the Daily Mirror printed on the day he was born – it was such an amazing present.  “We had it photocopied because it was so delicate and I think he may even have tried to do the crossword in that as well.” The front page reported the death of flight pioneer Samuel Franklin Cody who was killed test flying his latest design, the Cody Floatplane, which broke up at 200ft and also killed cricketer William Evans. Arthur was the youngest of nine children, with three sisters and five brothers. He grew up close to Tottenham Hotspur’s football stadium in North London. He still supports them today. He moved to Caversham, Reading, for work when he was 24, just before the start of the Second World War, and that is where he met his wife Jessie.  The pair worked for different firms in the same street and met while cycling in one day. They married a year later in 1940 and spent their honeymoon cycling around Devon and Cornwall – a hobby they shared for six decades. Soon after they wed, Arthur volunteered for the Army and was stationed in Southampton as an anti-aircraft gunner. His job was to load large ammunition shells into the guns, which would be used to bring down German bombers attacking oil refineries and ships. After his unit was hit by a German bomb he was transferred to an army base in Iceland, where he worked in telecoms.  After the war he returned to Reading, where he and Jessie started jobs as clerks for the Royal Corps of Signals, organising military records for over three decades until they retired in the late 1980s. The pair were both Labour Party members and voted for them in every election. They had two daughters, Wendy and Christine, who went on to have six children between them. As well as the six grandchildren Arthur now has nine great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren, Leo, six, and Lucas, three. Jessie died in 2000, in her mid 80s. Arthur turned 105 on Wednesday and celebrated at the Maples Wellbeing Day Care Centre, in Caversham, with his entire family around him.

The Duke of Sussex reportedly called Thomas Markle Snr at his home in Rosarito, Mexico, to ask if he’d been working with a photographer after growing suspicious over an increasing number of photos.  Veteran royal photographer Arthur Edwards claims Harry’s now father-in-law assured him he had not.  It led to a statement being made by Kensington Palace through the press watchdog asking for the 74-year-old’s privacy to be respected.  But less than 48 hours later, Markle was exposed when CCTV footage of him setting up the pictures with a British paparazzi emerged. Meghan Markle\u0027s rise to royalty in pictures - from starry-eyed child to Duchess of Sussex Speaking on a BBC Radio Kent phone-in show hosted by Prince Harry\u0027s biographer Duncan Larcombe, Edwards said Markle\u0027s denial caused “embarrassment” to the Prince. He explained: “Harry spoke to the father direct and said have you been cooperating with the paparazzi. He said no. The Palace put out a statement on Friday night saying to respect his privacy. Harry had been reassured by the father it was not going on.”  The Prince, 33, had grown suspicious after four sets of pictures emerged in a newspaper which appeared to be set up. They showed Markle reading a book on Britain, working out on an exercise bike, being measured for a suit and surfing the internet looking at pictures of his daughter. Edwards added: “We knew the father was colluding with the paparazzi. Everyone in the business knows that. When he was in the library, looking at the TV screen and they happen to be there. “You don\u0027t get measured up for a suit in a shop window. “He told him he had not colluded.

The Newcastle United owner snapped up the department store giant for \u0026pound90million – safeguarding jobs for now – and vowing to take it upmarket.  But there was no word on the long-term future of House of Fraser’s 16,000 strong workforce – 5,900 hired directly and 10,100 by in-store concessions. And around 10,000 members of the chain’s pension fund face being short changed because of the way it was sold. Mr Ashley’s Sports Direct empire bought House of Fraser after it collapsed into administration yesterday.  It marked the biggest high street failure since Woolworths went bust a decade ago with the loss of 27,000 jobs, and BHS two years ago, when 11,000 workers got the chop. Mr Ashley failed to give a firm pledge on jobs at House of Fraser. He said only: “We will do our best to keep as many stores open as possible.” His comments failed to convince union chiefs who have criticised Sports Direct’s alleged treatment of workers. Scott Lennon, of Unite, said: “Sports Direct is a leopard that has not changed its spots and we hope its poor record on pay and employment practices are not transferred to the House of Fraser.  “We fear for jobs and employment conditions at the House of Fraser going forward. The staff are entering a period of great uncertainty and worry.” Dave Gill, of shopworkers’ union Usdaw, said: “It is crucial that staff are treated with dignity and fairness.” Retail analyst Richard Hyman said: “People are being treated shabbily. It’s disgusting and they deserve a lot better.” The \u0026pound90million sale price comes despite the business having assets of nearly \u0026pound950million as of January. But the chain had racked up heavy losses and was lumbered with \u0026pound400million debts – leaving it due to close 31 of its 59 stores. Those plans are up in the air after the deal with Sports Direct, which already owned an 11% stake in House of Fraser. Attention immediately turned to what Mike Ashley would do with the business.  The 53-year-old maverick tycoon has gone from opening a sports shop at 18 in 1981 to overseeing a retail empire and amassing a \u0026pound2.8billion fortune. He has also snapped up older sports brands, Slazenger and Dunlop. Sports Direct also owns a big stake in Debenhams, another struggling chain, as well as Goals Soccer Centres and online fashion firm MySale. Yesterday’s deal was seen by some as Mr Ashley staking a claim as king of the high street. It appeared plans include turning some House of Fraser stores into Sports Direct or Flannels, its upmarket fashion chain. Mr Ashley said: “It is vital we restore the right level of ongoing relationships with the luxury brands. “My ambition is to transform House of Fraser into Harrods of the High Street.”  As it happens, House of Fraser owned upmarket London store Harrods between 1957 and 1994. Mr Ashley previously vowed to turn Sports Direct into the “Selfridges of sport”, in a reference to the department store chain. House of Fraser was bought by Sports Direct in a controversial deal, known as pre-pack administration. This normally involves a buyer snapping-up a business, minus its debts and pension fund. It is believed the 10,000 members in House of Fraser’s two main defined benefit pension schemes – which have an more than \u0026pound160million shortfall under a “buy-out” valuation – will likely transfer to an insurance firm. However, members who have yet to give up work could see their pension pots cut and those who have retired will get smaller annual increases. But expert John Ralfe said members were better off than if the schemes ended up with the Pension Protection Fund rescue body.  “The bad news is that even this higher level will be less than the full pension promise members expected,” he said. It is understood administrators at accountancy firm EY, and House of Fraser’s banks, chose Mr Ashley over a more than \u0026pound100million offer from rival billionaire Philip Day. The option put forward by Dubai-based Mr Day, who owns the Edinburgh Woollen Mill chain, would have avoided an administration and included House of Fraser’s pension scheme. Richard Lim, of Retail Economics, warned: “Turning around the business will not come easy. The stores are failing to attract sustainable levels of footfall while battling against rising operating costs and shifts in shopper behaviour.” Analyst Mr Hyman estimated 90% of House of Fraser’s stock was owned by in-store concessions, rather than the firm itself.  House of Fraser’s collapse came four years after Chinese firm Sanpower, controlled by chain-smoking deal maker Yuan Yafei, bought 89% of the business for \u0026pound480million. Plans to open a chain of House of Fraser stores in China flopped. Mr Yuan, one of China’s 100 richest people and who amassed a big collection of Chinese art, had planned to sell a 51% stake in the chain to C.banner, a Hong Kong-listed footwear retailer, run by his brother-in-law Chen Yixi. That deal fell through, ultimately triggering House of Fraser’s collapse.

Lindsey Goldrick Dean, 48, fell victim to a campaign of abuse and intimidation by a man she met online after placing an advertisement on a dating site back in 2004. Mum-of-one Lindsey, then aged 34, struck up a lively email correspondence with businessman Paul Curran, finding him to be a funny and articulate potential partner. However it was not to be - the pair embarked on several dates but Lindsey concluded that the chemistry was not there and decided to end the fledgling romance. Unknown to Lindsey, this would mark the start of 14 years of psychological torture by her spurned partner. Curran set up dozens of websites in Lindsey\u0027s name, filling them with sexual content, vile abuse and slurs.   At one stage he even paid for an advertisement which displayed Lindsey\u0027s name in Google search results accompanied by a link to a website which contained sickening insults.  Curran also sent emails and letters to family and friends after uncovering their contact details, even sending ashes to her mother\u0027s home. Police arrested and cautioned Curran but could do little to stem the seemingly endless stream of abuse. Because he spent much of his time abroad due to his work as a technology consultant, authorities were often powerless to prevent him from continuing his online attacks. After being granted legal aid two years ago, Lindsey summoned the courage to pursue Curran in the courts which culminated in a High Court case this month which ultimately ruled that he must pay his victim substantial damages.   I was willing to risk bankruptcy to be out of his control, she told the Daily Mail . He could have offered me a million pounds and I would still have said no. It was the principle.  He hijacked my privacy, my energy and my confidence and the lengths he went to do so were simply extraordinary. There were times when I thought I would never be free of him. I felt helpless. Lindsey now lives near Yeovil in Somerset with her husband and 9-year-old son and says she is finally free of Curran.

She was found dead by her social worker, Leanne Palethorpe, who had rushed to her home after receiving a series of worrying emails. She was found slumped against a wall, wrapped in a duvet and clutching her teddy bear after taking her own life. Above her were detailed notes to her family and a playlist titled \u0027suicide\u0027 was playing.

The coroner heard how Alisha had been repeatedly in and out of care facilities from the age of 15, after her mum had become increasingly worried about her repeated claims of feeling suicidal.    Between the ages of 15 and 18 when had been moved between multiple care units and services including from Southampton Priory, to Prospect Park hospital before being settled at a supported living facility in Reading, Berks.

The astonishing findings emerged in a report of 2,000 parents of kids aged 0-16. The results show 52 per cent are happy to use bad language in the presence of their children. More than one in five parents with young children said they believed it\u0027s OK to swear in front of little ones as they’re \u0027too young to understand\u0027 what\u0027s being said. It also emerged one third will continue to use expletives even if children know what they mean – as long as they know they aren’t allowed to repeat them themselves.  The study was conducted by ChannelMum. Founder Siobhan Freegard said: “The topic of swearing in front of children is definitely something of a taboo among many parents. “Before kids learn to talk, parents often feel they can continue speaking the same way they always have. “But it’s not long before children are picking up bits of language from their parents – and by age two are very adept at parroting words back they’ve heard mum or dad use.” The research also found nearly two thirds of respondents have sworn in front of their children, or even someone else’s. One in five believe swearing is harmless, and simply a part of everyday language - and 15 per cent believe kids are likely to hear swear words in the playground at school anyway. A further tenth of respondents are so used to swearing at work that they find it hard to switch off the bad language when they get home. One in five have had to apologise to fellow parent for swearing in front of their child, and the same amount have told off another mum or dad for doing so in front of their kids.  There is also some grey area over what exactly constitutes a swear word – with four in five parents believing some words are far worse than others. Six in 10 believe ‘bloody’ is fine to say in front of young listeners, three times more than would use the F-word. Despite parents being happy to swear in front of their children, 64 per cent admit to being ‘worried’ about the language their child uses. But four in 10 have heard their own child swear in front of them, with ‘sh*t’ the most common word uttered. And half of horrified mums and dads realised that it was a word they’d used themselves which their child was repeating back to them. ChannelMum founder Siobhan Freegard added: We all know the stresses of parenting can secretly make you want to swear sometimes, so many parents use ‘Swear Swops’ to get the frustrations out but keep the bad language in - and little ears protected. Some of the most popular include \u0027what the frog\u0027, \u0027shitake mushrooms\u0027 and \u0027fire truck\u0027, none of which will get you or your kids branded potty mouths.

Over the weekend and the next few days, the remains of Storm Debby is set to sweep in from the Atlantic bringing with it heavy rain, gales and floods. It has been estimated that as much as 20mm to 30mm of rain will fall in an hour, bringing with it thunder storms and large hail. However this is not the end of the glorious sunshine for the year as next weekend the heatwave will return and remain until the end of the summer. Temperatures will widely move back to the 30 degree region with a record of 38.6C set to blast the country. Weather models show the risk of storms will continue across much of the country to the middle of August.  Met Office meteorologist Becky Mitchell warned many places will see heavy rain this weekend after a brief respite on Saturday morning.  She said to The Express : “Much of the UK will wake to a chillier morning on Saturday and it will turn cloudier through the day with outbreaks of rain moving from the west which could turn heavy.  “Later in the day the weather will be influenced by the remains of Tropical Storm Debby, air associated with this storm will get caught up with a low-pressure system bringing higher temperatures and some heavier rain and wind. “Much of the UK will see outbreaks of heavy rain on Sunday and it will continue to be breezy, it is a generally unsettled picture through next week.  “People with outdoor plans should perhaps try to squeeze them in on Saturday morning.” Early forecasts show the possibility of a return to warmer, drier and sunnier conditions later this month, she added. She said: “There are some models pointing towards an increased chance of more settled, sunnier weather towards the end of next weekend. “We are also seeing signs of a more prolonged spell of settled weather and there is a chance that all of the UK could see more in the way of sunshine and warm temperatures towards the end of the month.” Travel disruption is expected with the chaotic weather as well as damage to homes. The south-west of England and Wales are due to experience local flooding from surface water over the weekend. There is a silver lining, according to long-range forecasters who say the heat is set to return. This will begin during the middle of the month and will continue throughout the rest of summer and into autumn.

Experts claim the things you draw are \u0027linked to the psyche\u0027Experts and graphologists says our subconscious scribblings, be they of stars or zigzags, can indicate a huge range of personality traits or secrets in our pastShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByRob Knight17:18, 10 AUG 2018NewsYour doodling habits may well say a lot about your personality (Image: Maddie Yuille/SWNS.COM)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDoodles say more about our personalities than we may realise, it has emerged. Experts have revealed our subconscious scribblings can show we have a selfish side, are feeling the pressure at work – and even that we\u0027ve got skeletons in our cupboards. The shapes and objects drawn, the colour of ink used and the position of the scribble on the page can all provide clues into our state of mind, life outlook, motivations and more. An arch shape for instance can indicate someone is secretive, while retraced doodles – going over your doodle in the same spot – are often a sign of being overworked. Criss-crosses can be a sign of anxiety, straight lines suggest someone is a ‘no nonsense’ type and pointed shapes can indicate an ambitious and competitive nature.  The hidden meanings were revealed after makers of the 4 Colours pen, BIC, teamed up with doodle expert and consultant graphologist, Tracey Trussell, to launch their Design and Shine competition. As part of the launch BIC also commissioned research among 2,000 UK adults and found we doodle four times a week on average - for 15 hours a year in total. Tracey Trussell, said: “Doodles are like little maps that guide us in the exploration of people\u0027s psyches. “They are created casually - usually when the doodler is concentrating on something else - by the complete free-flow of uninhibited symbols, \u0027live and direct\u0027 from the subconscious.  “This means they\u0027re the outward expression of our unconscious thoughts, and not intended for any particular recipient or for any specific use.” The research found two thirds doodle when they are bored, one fifth do it when they’re anxious or stressed - and one quarter do it when they are in relaxed state of mind. Two thirds also think doodles can reveal a lot about someone’s personality, which could explain why 35 per cent avoid letting others see their scribbles.  The most popular forms of doodle are shapes and patterns – 69 per cent draw in this way. Circles and round shapes typically indicate someone is friendly and kind - this type of doodler is also motivated by love and they don’t like conflict. Squares are often indicative of those who like organisation and to be in control - and tend to have meticulous planning skills. Triangles and pointed shapes are usually drawn by ambitious people – those who will stop at nothing to achieve their goals and dreams. This shape can also indicate someone is competitive and resourceful but might also suggest someone has an abrasive personality. One fifth of the population tend to doodle recognisable objects such as flowers, houses, stars and faces.  Flowers are the most popular recognisable objects drawn and tend to suggest someone is loyal and faithful – and that friendships and relationships matter to them. A large circular centre flower shows confidence and is indicative of someone who likes attention. However carefully drawn flowers suggest someone has an obsessive-compulsive personality. The second most popular objects sketched are stars – and as they contain points they can indicate someone is ambitious. Those who doodle in this way have high expectations and aspirations in life – and are determined to succeed. Faces are the third most favoured and can indicate a host of things depending on what form they take. For instance, self-portraits can indicate someone is egocentric, but drawing other faces is often indicative of someone who is more of a people’s person.  But it’s not just what you doodle which provides insight into someone’s personality or outlook on life. Those who do large doodles want to be noticed whereas smaller doodlers enjoy the quiet life and are modest types. Drawing the same shape or object over and over again – but not on the same spot – reveals patience and perseverance. Doodling on the same spot is an indication of anxiety, and is often drawn when people are under pressure – it can also be a sign of guilt. Shaded or filled doodles can simply mean someone is bored, but can also indicate they are unhappy, have bottled-up anger or lack self-confidence. Used by two thirds of Brits, black is the most popular ink colour for doodling – and this choice of colour often suggests someone is decisive and hardworking.  Blue ink – typically used by 17 per cent – often suggests someone is peaceful and patient. Red is commonly used by energetic, passionate individuals, and green is the choice of eccentrics. The use of brighter colours such as yellow and orange often indicate someone is fun and frivolous – with a vivid and creative imagination. Nearly a quarter take pride in what they sketch and keep their old doodles. In fact, 24 per cent think their doodles are good enough to be considered works of art. Tracey Trussell added: “Doodling helps you to focus and concentrate on whatever you\u0027re doing.  “It\u0027s effective for problem solving and it\u0027s also a source of creativity and brilliant for brainstorming, because it\u0027s a conduit for ideas and light bulb moments. “It\u0027s also a way of helping to process difficult emotions - doodles are like safety valves for releasing negative emotions and feelings.” BIC is offering doodlers aged 13 plus the chance to have their drawings appear on the iconic 4 Colours pen.

The company said it will be closing manufacturing operations in Italy and Mexcio and will outsource production to an as yet undisclosed country, a statement said. The announcement comes as shuttered 28 of its stores worldwide - with plans to close a further 132 stores later this year. The company currently has 558 stores worldwide. It was also said that current CFO, Carrie Teffner, will be leaving the business in March of this year and will be replaced by Anne Mehlman, the finance chief of Zappos.  The company - headquartered in Niwot, Colorado nearly 30 miles outside of Denver - focuses on its signature breathable plastic foam clogs and became a hit in the mid noughties. In recent years, the Crocs has fallen out of favour with shoppers and saw its share price halve between 2014 and 2017, reaching a low of $5.94. Crocs has seen a stronger financial performance in intervening years on the back of successful innovations and an improved marketing strategy.  The company expects revenue to be just over $1bn for 2018, just below analysts expectations. Andrew Rees, CEO and president, said: Our clogs and sandals continue to perform well, and we are well positioned for the back half of the year. We expect double digit e-commerce growth and moderate wholesale growth to more than offset lower retail revenues due to operating fewer stores and business model changes.

Dewayne Johnson, 48, was awarded the extraordinary sum after a California jury ruled on Friday that the Monsanto\u0027s \u0027Roundup\u0027 product resulted him to develop non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. A former pest control manager for a California county school system, Johnson, 46, applied the weed killer up to 30 times per year. In court, doctors for the plaintiff claimed that the former school groundsman has just months to live. The simple fact is he is going to die. It\u0027s just a matter of time, his legal team told the jury in his opening statement last month.  Following the judgment, a clearly emotional Johson was seen smiling and hugging his lawyers. Dewayne is the first of hundreds of claimants who say the weedkiller caused cancer. Chemicals giant Monsanto, a unit of Bayer AG, faces more than 5,000 similar lawsuits across the United States.  The jury at San Francisco\u0027s Superior Court of California deliberated for three days before finding that Monsanto had failed to warn Johnson and other consumers of the cancer risks posed by its weed killers. It awarded $39 million in compensatory and $250 million in punitive damages. This jury found Monsanto acted with malice and oppression because they knew what they were doing was wrong and doing it with reckless disregard for human life, said Robert F. Kennedy Jr, Johnson\u0027s lawyer. This should send a strong message to the boardroom of Monsanto.

Jordan Holgerson suffered five broken ribs, a lung injury and several abrasions after falling from Moulton Falls on the Lewis River in Yacolt, Washington, in the US. The 16-year-old was caught on camera standing nervously at the edge of the bridge before her friend pushed her from behind. She was heard telling her friends \u0027no\u0027 twice in the video, but the group took no notice and forced her to take the plunge. Speaking to Mail Online, Jordan\u0027s aunt Kristie Morgan said her niece is suffering physically and emotionally having left hospital. She is having a hard time breathing and experiencing panic attacks. But despite the pain, Kristie said Jordan does not want \u0027revenge\u0027.  The aunt: Jordan is truly the sweetest girl in the world. She doesn\u0027t wish to seek revenge on her friend. But in my opinion her friend needs to learn a lesson. She could have killed her and it wouldn\u0027t be a question at all if she was in trouble for her actions. She would be in jail right now. But that is how Jordan feels. Jordan sister, Vanessa, spoke to KOIN in Canada shortly after the incident. I think she [the friend] tried to do it jokingly and didn\u0027t think what could have happened, Vanessa said. You don\u0027t really play around at 60 feet. Her other sister Kaytlin added: Friends don\u0027t push someone from that high, so I was pissed.  Kaytlin said she confronted the girl who pushed her sister on social media, looking for an apology. She pretty much said that she was sorry for doing it and she wouldn\u0027t have done it if she knew the outcome of it and that she knows it was an absurd thing to do, Kaytlin said. I think the girl that pushed her should have some sort of consequence because you wont learn your lesson if you think you can could do that again and think it will be fine. As Jordan fell, her arms and legs kick helplessly in a panic as she fell to the water below. The footage was taken on Tuesday and posted on YouTube by Ashley Mahree who described the act as \u0027almost criminal\u0027.

The nurse, from Donabate in North Co Dublin, Ireland, was left almost fully without sight after the parasite ate its way through her cornea. Suzanne her eyes gradually became more irritable on July 20 and she was in severe pain with an infection by the evening.  She told the Irish Mirror : “At 7.30pm I said I was going to bed and then at 1am I woke up and I was blind. I didn’t know what was happening because everything was black.  “There’s so many power cuts in Donabate as it is so I thought it was that, but deep down I knew there was something wrong. “So, I crawled my way out of the bedroom and my husband Paul is a taxi driver and thank God he came in [home] and he started screaming and he rang an ambulance. “My sight was gone, completely gone.

She added: “The staff were very good. They had to put a bleach in my eye and they told me to count to 10 the pain was so severe. They said, ‘Okay we’ve managed to deaden the nerves and clean them so we’ll be able to save the eye, but we’ll just have to keep you here’. So I was on morphine, the lot. The pain was like a searing hot knife through my eye.” “They were going to take the eye out. They were saying this is the Acanthamoeba virus and it has to go.” Explaining what happened to her, Suzanne said her consultant told her she “basically had a shower and there’s parasites in the water because the weather has been so warm.

British UN envoy Mark Griffith, speaking in the wake of dozens of civilians being killed in a bus blast, warned of “massive humanitarian suffering” if the bloodshed continues.  He said: “A failed state in Yemen has extraordinary consequences for the region, and the wider region, and beyond. And it’s not that inconceivable that could happen. We have to act now. “We also need to act now because in my judgment the war in Yemen will get more complicated the longer it goes on. “There will be more international interest and polarisation in terms of the parties, it will fragment further, it will be more difficult to resolve - even than it is now.”  He added: “My worry about Yemen is that if we left it and it wasn’t resolved, we could look at Syria-plus in the years to come.” The bodies of about 40 children were among scores killed in an airstrike in Saada province, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said. The UK Government faces calls to cease selling arms and providing military advice to Saudi Arabia, which leads a coalition that carried out the strike. Iran is supporting Houthi rebels who are being hammered from the air by the Saudi-led coalition in one of the Middle East’s most brutal proxy wars in decades.

return to the defence if he’s recovered from the swollen knee that forced him to sit out the Pars clash and the recent Betfred Cup trip to Elgin.And if he’s come through training this week without any reaction to the knock that’s sidelined him since last month’s defeat at Ross County, full-back Callum Booth will also return to the squad.After almost a month out, though, it may be the best he can hope for is a place on the bench.And the fact today sees United’s first outing of the campaign on a synthetic surface could be a factor in whether or not the pair are involved.Whoever he decides, or is able to use, Csaba will be looking for much better this time round.While injuries have ruled out various key players in the games so far, he believes those taking their places should be doing so with the aim of hanging on to them even if everyone is fit.“I have said to the team you cannot wait for Fraser Fyvie or Stewart Murdoch or Callum Booth or Billy King,” he said.“You should not just be a shadow for these players, you have to deliver, make competition for places.“They want to play in the first XI when they are fit – do you want to just give them your place?”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/Railway-track-railway-line-stock-image-e1533900087452.jpg ","title":"funding boost in bid for new local

He’s got the character to brush this off and against Aberdeen on Saturday, he’ll have no qualms going back in there and making saves.“Fans can be very fickle and obviously as a keeper mistakes are highlighted because they cost goals but Jack has the ability to go and be a hero this week.“In pre-season he obviously did something right to convince Neil McCann to put him in and take over from Elliott Parish.“Neil took Jack into the club to play and one mistake isn’t going to change that.“Over the course of the season I have no doubt he’ll save more points for Dundee than he’ll cost them.”Soutar admits Hamilton is suffering the “life of a goalie” at the moment, a position where an error more often than not leads to conceding a goal.However, as a Dundee fan himself, Soutar is backing the Dens faithful to get behind their new keeper this weekend and manager Neil McCann to stick with Hamilton between the posts.“Everybody makes mistakes and there will be some supporters who will be on your back from the first minute but as a goalkeeper you just have to go back in and make saves for your team,” he added.“Dundee fans, though, always forgive – it’s a speciality of the Dee support.“He lost the ball and lost a goal but if he goes and megs a boy on Saturday everybody will love him!“I think the manager will stick with him – it highlights the error more if he makes a switch.“Neil had obviously seen enough in Jack to start him this season and I think he should stick by that decision, at least for the first few games.“I had a terrible week myself at Dunfermline when Jim Duffy was manager at Dens – he could’ve dropped me but he stuck by me and I ended up being Man of the Match against Motherwell the next week.“The worst thing for Jack would be to drop him – let him get it out of his system and go play.“It’s the life of a goalie – everyone forgets the good stuff when you make a mistake.”Getting used to a new way of playing takes every player a bit of time to adjust – with the league campaign already under way, however, Soutar admits Hamilton will need to get used to playing out from the back quickly.“At Hearts over the last few years, the team has been a more physical side rather than the footballing team Dundee like to be.“Jack has to adapt to that very quickly, though. The manager likes to play out from the back and he’ll have to get used to it.“Sometimes, though, as a goalie when you’re under pressure, you just have to stick it in row Z and deal with the flak afterwards.“Jack will learn from it, though.“It’s still early days for him. It’s only one game and I’d back him to put in a performance on Saturday.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/08/5981c5392158b.jpg ","title":"scottish government recruits 93 folk from 1367 applicants to work at new benefits hq in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Scottish Government has recruited 93 people in Dundee to work at the country’s new social security headquarters.Competition was fierce, with 1,367 applications made within a few weeks of the client service advisers’ roles being advertised, according to official figures.The city’s jobs boost is the first wave of appointments for the agency, which is initially operating from the council’s base on North Lindsay Street.The advisers will be processing applications and responding to queries.The starting salary was advertised as £17,641.The agency is expected to be fully operational by 2021 with 1,900 jobs spread across the country, 750 of which will be in Dundee.It’s expected 80 posts will be filled in this recruitment round, but the number of people appointed is higher because of working practices such as job sharing.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b6d5a753ec2b.jpg ","title":"sculptor has designs on community art spaces","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee artist and sculptor has ambitious plans to create a community garden in the Linlathen area of the city to display his work and that of others.Joe Alcorn, 67, also hopes to develop community art spaces all over the city.He is currently in talks with Lidl about having a piece of his work on show at the new retail development site planned for Kingsway East.Joe creates amazing works of art and sculptures at his home in the city’s Fountainbleau Road.His small back garden plays host to an incredible display of his sculptures created over the past 15 years.He said each sculpture takes about three months to complete and they are carved out of sandstone and granite.He said: “I am now retired and can spend all my days in my workshop in the garden.“I work with recycled stone as much as possible and also take inspiration from the piece of stone I have to work with.”He has recently created a series of sculptures based on Pictish art.Joe has high hopes they will be the pieces that kick off the community garden.“I have studied a lot about Pictish art and have created a whole series of sculptures which are based on my interpretation of their work,” he said.“I would love to create a community garden at the pavilion in Fountainbleau Road to encourage other people to come along and get involved and learn to enjoy art.“These are life-size pieces that I would love to see in such a garden.“However, my plans for the garden are not just for my sculptures.“I would like other artists to contribute as well and create a space for everyone in Dundee to enjoy.“If that is successful I would also love to see community art spaces all over the city.”Among the Pictish pieces is one inspired by river deities.Joe said: “I have named my piece Tay.“It would be a fantastic piece to have somewhere down at the new Waterfront.“I have also had initial talks with Dundee City Council about possibly getting some of the pieces displayed around the Waterfront, maybe even at Slessor Gardens.“I want to open up art to people all over the city and encourage others to get involved.“I would be making my pieces available free of charge.“If any do sell then the money would be ploughed back into my Art Social group to get people taking part in creating art.“We need to give art back to the community.“I do a lot of work through the group because I believe society needs to be included in the creative activity, and everyone can understand art at a basic level.

Initially thought to be those of a notorious clan chief nicknamed the Old Fox, they were discovered to be those of a young woman plus four others.Previously, the mausoleum and burial ground drew in a few hundred people each year but last year numbers were between 2000 and 2500 - although it could be higher as not all visitors are recorded.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile the burial ground is owned by Highland Council, the 17th century building is owned by the voluntary-run Wardlaw Mausoleum Trust which faces a constant challenge regarding its maintenance.Trust member Erik Lundberg said it was a technically-challenging task to carry out appropriate upkeep and repairs to the building given its age and construction.There was a problem with persistent moisture, for example, caused by an adjoining burial area having a higher ground level than the mausoleum.\"The trust was set up in the early 1990s to take over the ownership and eventual restoration of the mausoleum and that was done in 1998,\" Mt Lundberg said.\"The only income the trust gets is from donations from visitors. When you don\u0026rsquot get as many visitors as you would like especially up until recent years, you don\u0026rsquot really have the funds to maintain the building as you would like.\"He explained that the building should undergo lime rendering to the outside and lime plastering to the inside plus coats of lime wash about every five years.

He is also in contention to start this afternoon against Dundee at Dens Park.The former Wigan man had a strong finish to last season, starting in the Reds’ last four post-split fixtures.He admits that at this early stage in his Aberdeen career he did not expect to play quite so much. Cosgrove feels he is improving with every game but reckons the Red Army have yet to see his best form – and he is keen to show it in the weeks ahead.He said: “The game time I’ve been getting is absolutely invaluable to me for my performance and development.“It’s exactly what I want to be doing and the calibre of games we’ve been playing in will be nothing but good for me personally.“I think it would be naive to say I expected to play as much as I have but I definitely knew that I could it’s early in my time here but there’s no point in just plodding along and getting the odd game.“I wanted to come here and really stamp my authority and I think I have done. It’s just getting to that next level – whether that’s goals, assists or high-quality performances, I feel I need to kick on.“I do feel there is more to come because I’m learning every game and getting better. The things you learn aren’t always obvious but there’s little things you pick up in games, like where to buy fouls and places to get free from defenders. Everything is adding up but I am still learning.“It does always play (not scoring) on your mind because as a striker it’s my main job, to score. But there’s a lot of work that goes under the radar, like working off the ball and holding up play and things that are vital for the team.“It’s the final piece, whether it’s an assist or a goal, that does get noticed and I’m just trying as hard as I can to do it all. I’m hoping the goals will come and once I get the first one, I’m hoping I can get more.”Cosgrove is also looking forward to savouring the moment of netting his first competitive goal for the Dons. He added: “It will be massive for me because it’s my job to score. Part of it will feel normal, but getting your first goal for a club is always special.”Ahead of today’s game against Dundee, Cosgrove says the Dons have a point to prove after what he feels was a below-par performance in the 1-1 draw with 10-man Rangers on Sunday.He said: “We’re disappointed with the performance on Sunday. But we’ve come away with a point and it does feel like a good point given the circumstances. Last week was the weeks we want to be playing in. We had a tough game down at Turf Moor against Burnley and then there was no better game than Rangers to come back to at Pittodrie.“As tough as it was, we were massively looking forward to it and they are the games we want to be playing week in and week out.“Now, though, the main focus is on Dundee and we’re looking forward to getting going again because we’ve got a point to prove, performance-wise.“We’ve had a good week’s training, we’re feeling and looking sharp so hopefully we can take that into the game. There’s been excuses about tiredness on Sunday but, as a team and a club, the performance wasn’t up to standard at all.“The Rangers game was massively disappointing but the belief is still there within the squad that there’s a lot more to come. Everyone has blips but we’ll bounce back and get the performances we need.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/SKIPPY-SKATEBOARD-940x362.jpg ","title":"win skippy peanut butter skateboard with helmet and pads","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOne lucky winner will get their hands on one of these cool, branded skateboards with a safety helmet and pads thrown in PLUS two jars of SKIPPY® Peanut Butter and a branded silicone spatula with the whole prize worth £200.Five runners-up can win two jars of SKIPPY® Peanut Butter plus a branded silicone spatula.All you need to do to be in with a chance of winning is fill in this form below.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeens techfest celebrates 25th anniversary","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA science and technology festival which has inspired hundreds of thousands of youngsters for 25 years is poised to return to Aberdeen.TechFest aims to promote science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) subjects.Along with interactive workshops, shows and presentations, people will get a chance to hear from former Olympic curler Jackie Lockhart.She will share stories from her career alongside manager of Curl Aberdeen and fellow champion curler Tom Brewster, who will provide technical insight into how the maintenance of ice can affect the outcome of a match.As part of its milestone year, in addition to a range of science topics on offer, there will also be a variety of events exploring the history and uses of silver.National Museums Scotland will also present key objects from its touring exhibition, with Behind The Scenes of Scotland’s Early Silver: From Conservation to Display on September 12.Sarah Chew, managing director of TechFest, said: “This is a really exciting year for TechFest as we celebrate 25 years of the festival and we are pleased to unveil such a diverse and fun-filled programme for our anniversary.“Over the years you can imagine how the event has changed.“If you look at the programme in 2001, we were following the possibility of water on Mars pretty closely.“And in that area, there has been massive discoveries and now we see in 2018 that life on Mars is much closer than we realised at the time.“There’s the story of a woman who is now a nursery manager and used to come to TechFest as a kid – and now she’s one of our presenters who helps us to be on the cutting edge.”Sarah added: “Once again we have some of the brightest minds and biggest personalities in the Stem sphere presenting, as well as musicians and sporting personalities who can demonstrate how Stem plays a role in their disciplines too.“A lot has changed since we first launched as a charity in 1995.“However, our ethos of inspiring, educating and entertaining people of all ages has remained the same and we can’t wait to welcome everyone.

There’s been an increase in people considering a career in early learning or childcare.”The former languages teacher also said that the council must “get it right for every child”. He said: “We have 36,000 children going to our schools everyday, and they are 36,000 different personalities, as we all are.“Our aim is to support the child who has five Highers and is going to

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

He played for two seasons at Murray Park, taking part in tournaments at Turin in Italy  and in Russia at Shakhtar Donetsk before moving to Ralston, where he signed for St Mirren FC and had an enjoyable two seasons before returning to Lochgilphead Red Star YFC.Proud dad Dougie also happens to be the Red Star manager, and he said: \u0026#8216As a manager, it is always sad to lose your best players, but after the team\u0026#8217s success last year we had rumblings that something may happen at the end of the season.\u0026#8216As a club, we are delighted that one of our players has been given the chance to go and make an impact at senior level and just goes to show the hard work put in by the volunteers at the soccer centre, youth and amateur teams that there will be chances if players show the right attitude and commitment, whether at our level or at the youths.\u0026#8216Locally there are a number of youngsters who are with Partick Thistle, Hamilton, Rangers and others, which is great for such a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8217Taking off his manager\u0026#8217s hat, Dougie added: \u0026#8216As parents, both myself and Fiona are delighted.

Sadly the rally was over for both crews after stage four due to electrical problems and other issues.Donald Bowness battled it out in the usual competitive class two with his Vauxhall Nova with Andrew Blackwood on the notes. Bowness enjoyed the battle with Michael Harbour during a Saturday which saw crews struggle to keep cars cool while specators looked on in glorious sunshine. Rally journalist John Fife was prompted to comment: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s like watching two spoilt weans scrapping over one tube of smarties.\u0026#8217Sunday saw a complete change in the weather and crews continued to battle it out in some very wet and slippy stages. Donald Bowness finished 11th overall and first in class two, followed by Michael Harbour in second. Another local man, Jamie Miller, finished an impressive third in the class on what was his first time out in his new car \u0026#8211 without so much as  a test drive in his the Citroen C2R2 Max.Class one saw Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter battle it out in Innes\u0026#8217 newly built Rover , with another excellent drive from the pair who also finished the rally with a trophy win, coming third in their class. Alan \u0026#8216Goldie\u0026#8217 Ross decided not to enter this year as he is selling his Citroen Saxo rally car and instead enjoyed the rally from the spectating areas.The overall winners of the 2018 Mach 1 stages were Bruce Edwards and Jim Smith in the Darrian follwed by Gordon Morrison and Calum Macpherson in their Subaru Impreza and third place went to Ian Paterson and Callum Shanks also in a Subaru Impreza.All the local drivers appreciate the efforts of Davie Hatrick and the team behind the scenes of DCC, who put so much time and effort to bring this fantastic rally to Argyll each year.The rally is always on the lookout for new volunteers to marshal at the event, this is a great opportunity for locals to get up close to the action and learn more about the sport.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 30","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 9:27 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,As usual with Councillor Redman, he was so desperate to berate the SNP in his letter published in the July 20 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser that he is unable to see the hypocrisy of his own stance.He talks of \u0026#8216stealth taxes\u0026#8217 hitting \u0026#8216the most vulnerable people in our society, particularly elderly people living alone\u0026#8217.His accusation of \u0026#8216taking their eye off the day job\u0026#8217 begs the question as to where he was when the Tory government introduced its bedroom tax \u0026#8211 a tax on those who needed an extra room for live-in carers, a tax on grandparents who wanted to have their grandchildren to stay for weekends and at holiday times a tax on widows with sons and daughters in the armed forces expected to sleep on a sofa when home on leave.A disgraceful tax which the SNP government abolishedDavid Hay, MinardSir,It was superb to once again meet up with locals in Whitehouse and across west Kintyre. As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray golf club hold gents open","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 31/07/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe 2018 Gents Open was held on Saturday July 28.Despite the heavy overnight rain the course held up well and was in great condition for the players.The competition was well contested in both the scratch and net categories.The net competition was won by Neil Armour with an impressive 71.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre scores with support from ardrishaig community trust","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIn a fantastic boost for youth football in Mid Argyll, the Ardrishaig Community Trust and Lochgilphead Soccer Centre have jointly announce that Ardrishaig Community Trust will be the main sponsor of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre for the next three years.The funding package, worth £5,000 for each of the next three years, will make a huge contribution to the centre’s ambitious development plans – it already has more than 120 members, including around 40 from Ardrishaig.The development plan will see the Soccer Centre invest in new equipment, quality coaching to help the youngsters develop their football skills, participation in football festivals, and attend Scotland games, among other things.The funding will meet the cost of around 100 new football strips, all branded with Ardrishaig Community Trust, and will help ensure all Lochgilphead Red Star YFC teams are kitted out the same, from primary one to sevens (including the girls’ teams).The cost of kit to keep the coaches – who contribute the equivalent of around £15,000 a year in time – warm and dry throughout the year, will be part funded by the sponsorship. The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust. In the first instance this will involve running a number of football-related activities at Ardrishaig Gala Day.Hamish Nicol, chairman of the Ardrishaig Community Trust said: ‘In the official year of young people we are a delighted to support an organisation who match our ambitions to create a better tomorrow for our young people.‘The trust has been very active behind the scenes over the last few years and this three year programme of support allows us to raise our profile.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead dancer wins big at southend games","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 7:13 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTen-year-old Olivia Veitch was celebrating with her family after an amazing performance at Southend Games.The highland dancer won first place in Highland Laddie, Barracks Johnnie and Reel of Tulloch and second place in Seann Triubhas and Highland Fling, also winning the overall intermediate section.The dancer from Lochgilphead dances at the James McCorkindale School of Dancing in Campbeltown.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sea unites the story of inverarays ferry","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 05/08/18, 8:55 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowBy Colin CameronMuch of the detail in this feature comes from two booklets written by the late Donald MacKechnie, the well-known Inveraray schoolmaster and local historian.The booklets, \u0026#8216Inveraray Notes\u0026#8217 and \u0026#8216Inveraray Tales and Traditions\u0026#8217, were published in the 1980s.Look out for tales from these fascinating booklets in coming editions of the Argyllshire Advertiser.As a starter, we turn to links across Loch Fyne, and the Inveraray-St Catherines ferry.Based on information by Donald MacKechnieFrom the Middle Ages until 1963 a ferry sailed between Inveraray and St Catherines \u0026#8211 one of seven similar services up and down Loch Fyne linking Cowal and Mid Argyll. Before the roads were made these were important links- the sea unites and the land divides.Arguably the most important ferry followed the Inveraray \u0026#8211 St Catherines route, connecting with coach services to Loch Goil and the onward steamer to Greenock or Glasgow.At one time a large sailing boat carried horses and cattle. A rowing or sailing yawl conveyed pilgrims, pedlars, travellers and soldiers. Pilgrims and blind persons were carried free.From the 17th Century the ferry and ferryman\u0026#8217s house were auctioned annually by Inveraray Town Council to the highest bidder, with the burgh providing the two vessels. The ferryman kept the fares, and part of the deal was that the minister and magistrates would travel free of charge.When Inveraray new town was built in the 18th Century the Ferry Land housed the ferrier, who supplemented his income by running a dram shop. The Ferry Inn was a popular pub until 1917, when its licence was revoked.In 1827 David Napier, later a famous shipbuilder, introduced two steamers, the Thalia and Robert Bruce, from Inveraray to St Catherines and other ports on Loch Fyne. In 1836 the Lochgoil and Loch Long Steamboat Company became tenants of the ferry with a small paddle steamer, though the rowing/sailing boats were still available for a lower fare.From St Catherines their horse-drawn coach conveyed passengers to Lochgoilhead, from where they joined a steamer to the central belt.In 1856 the company introduced a new steamer, the Argyle. She was not a success, with author Alexander Smith describing her as \u0026#8216a small wash-tub of a steamer that carries you across Loch Fyne in an hour\u0026#8217.In 1865 the Inveraray Ferry and Coach Company took over with their beautiful little steamer, the Fairy.The route did not pay, however, and in 1892 the town council set up the ferry as a municipal enterprise with Fairy II, a little steel paddle steamer. When to town council gave up running the service in 1909, Mr John Dewar continued until the Fairy II was wrecked in the great storm of November 1912.Thereafter there were a number of ferriers. James Douglas used a Loch Fyne skiff fitted with a motor and Hope MacArthur operated launches called the Happy Return and the Jean.The car and bus rendered the sea link unnecessary and the service ended in 1963.A winter trip across Loch Fyne is recorded in the following song, sung to the tune \u0026#8216Kitty of Lochgoil\u0026#8217. Here are some of the verses:The Fairy in the Fog\u0026#8216Twas in the year of \u0026#821781On Januar\u0026#8217 the fourth dayThe steamer Fairy crossed Loch FyneTo Sweet St Catherines bay.Our Captain Bold was Duncan BellOur pilot Donuil DhuThe engineer Shon GilliesAnd Dugal Piobair was the crew.The passengers were soon aboardThat Coachy Jock had broughtAnd then again through blinding fogOur homeward way we sought.The day with fog was thick and darkYou could neither hear nor seeBut Donuil Dhu just kept her noseStraight from St Catherines quay.The pilot at his stemmy postStood firm as any rockThe compass true before his eyesJust like my grandfather clockAs we came near the Newtown bay.Our reckoning scarce could failSaid Dougal Piobair to himself\u0026#8216I wish we saw the jail\u0026#8217.The captain stood upon the deckA few feet from the funnelAnd to the pilot passed the word\u0026#8216Keep clear of Mackenzie\u0026#8217s tunnel\u0026#8217.Already we were sheering offOur course we knew quite wellWhen through the fog some lengths awayThere came a dismal yell.\u0026#8216Now what was that?\u0026#8217 the captain cried\u0026#8216I ne\u0026#8217er heard the like before\u0026#8217Said Dugal Piobair: \u0026#8216Sure it is a Pochkan on the shore\u0026#8217.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"food music and fun at tayvallich weekend gala","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/08/18, 7:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTayvallich was the place to be last weekend when the annual village gala was celebrated in style.The Tayvallich Weekend is the main fundraiser for Tayvallich Village Hall, which is preparing for a major redevelopment.The festivities kicked off on Friday evening with a barbecue at the Tayvallich Inn. This was a chance for villagers and visitors to get together to share food and drink, with musical entertainment from Paisley singer/songwriter Alan McKim.A wet start to Saturday July 28 failed to deter the enthusiasm of the crowds who converged on Tayvallich Village Hall for fun activities such as children’s sports, a bouncy castle and a pop-up crazy golf course that kept adults and children amused. The marquees provided shelter from the showers and a chance to browse the stalls.As well as classics like the bottle stall and guess the weight of the cake, there were representations from local businesses, voluntary groups and organisations, including the RNLI, Friends of the Sound of Jura, Heart of Argyll Wildlife and the 19th Argyll Scouts.After a break for lunch of paella, barbecue, sandwiches and home baking, the sun came out in time for the fabulous dog show, which featured novelty classes such as best six legs, fancy dress and the dog and handler race.Events moved into the hall on Saturday evening for the family ceilidh, where the fantastic Argyll Ceilidh Trail band kept the dancers on their feet into Sunday morning.

Wages were 45p/hour and the telephone bill was £32.\u0026#8217Mrs Coats reflected on those early days: \u0026#8216I  could type, so I was asked to be the association secretary,\u0026#8217 she recalled modestly.The truth is, though, that her passion held Earra Gael together for decades with the help of many different volunteers in the shop.She continued: \u0026#8216Earra Gael is really a community. We have always had a good team. It was a lot of hard work, but very enjoyable.\u0026#8217One of the tasks shop staff were required to perform was to operate the weighbridge \u0026#8211 and this continued until 1987.There was more to running the association that selling pottery and weighing lorries, as Mrs Coats\u0026#8217 daughter Amanda remembers. \u0026#8216There was very little storage in the shop, so mum stored the stock at home.\u0026#8216Mum travelled all over to visit suppliers and she would set off on the bus in the morning and we never knew what she would come back with.\u0026#8217After running the shop for 20 years, Mrs Coats is taking a well-earned rest as Tarbert artist Wilma MacKenzie takes over the reins.Mrs Coats said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s nice to feel it is going to continue, slightly differently perhaps, but it\u0026#8217s going to continue.\u0026#8217PICS:Sarah Coats pictured outside the shop in the 1970s. no_a31EarraGael02Mrs Coats with her friend, Tarbert artist Ann Thomas who was one of the original members of the association in 1973. 08_a30GiftShopSarah02Members and volunteers at Earra Gael today.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities.

Contractors will move in tomorrow night (Saturday) in a bid to hold up the crumbling building. Works, which will take place while the line is shut, could take at least three nights to complete. In a private briefing note seen by the Ayrshire Post, council officials have outlined extensive repairs set to take place. South Ayrshire chief executive, Eileen Howat, says: The works - which can only be completed during the closure of the railway line - involve the use of a crane, lighting, cutting and drilling equipment to remove a number of unsafe materials from the roof of the building and the installation of a new exterior protective net system. Work is scheduled to start at 10pm tomorrow night with teams operating until 6am. It\u0027s understood scheduled services will not be affected. Ms Howat said contractors should complete their work within three nights but warned the findings of a trackside roof inspection could extend the process. She added: While our contractors will do everything they can to minimise any noise and disruption during this time, we do know some noise will be unavoidable. Residents in the area were informed by hand-delivered letters this afternoon. It follows the council swooping on the building earlier this summer after labelling the B Listed structure an immediate risk to public safety. The hotel\u0027s current owners, based in Malaysia, have so far failed to act on a Dangerous Building Notice served on the hotel in the Spring.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTransportAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united reject 150000 bid","story":"NewsAyr United reject £150,000 bid for striker Lawrence ShanklandUnited directors are holding firm in their bid to keep hold of the highly rated striker.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:09, 7 AUG 2018NewsShankland is a man in demand (Image: SNS Group)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have today rejected an offer of \u0026pound150,000 for star striker Lawrence Shankland.

Furious Pat Spence, plagued by ill-health she says is caused by the whirring windmills, revealed Scottish Power has failed to hand over data they promised. Now Pat says: “They’re not getting their machines back until they do what they said they would. “I want a legally binding agreement stating they will supply me with the information.” The 74-year-old is at the centre of a bitter battle with Scottish Power Renewables who have been circling her home near Barrhill with hundreds of giant wind turbines. We’ve been charting Pat’s plight since last March.  The flautist and music publisher says bad vibrations makes her sick and sleep-deprived. And she says that the 19th century Dochroyle hill farm steading she has lived in for more than 30 years has changed from “dream home to torture chamber.” On one occasion she was forced into sleeping in her car in the village. The turbine blades fire infrasound waves towards her home and Pat says the alien rhythm interferes with her body’s natural rhythm. As a result she says she feels like it’s a cross between a heart attack and a panic attack and due to balance being connected to hearing, that’s what is making her sick. She simply wants the power company to buy her out. Her case has been backed by scientists and medics and she was visited again last week by retired GP and occupational physician Angela Shiells. Dr Shiells said: “I have an interest in the ill-effects of wind turbines and have been studying Pat’s case for a year.  “I have no doubt that her symptoms are related to the turbines surrounding her home.” Pat suspects the power firm have been unable to devise a method of analysis of low frequency sound despite international expert Professor Mariana Alves-Pereira being able to. She said: “Scottish Power say they would not allow the data to be released to me because Mariana would twist it. How dare they accuse her of such malpractice. All I want is my life back.” She fears large extensions are being planned for the Kilgallioch wind farm as well as the doubling in size of Arecleoch and Mark. A Scottish Power spokeswoman said: “We installed monitoring equipment in Ms Spence’s home over a year ago in response to a complaint made regarding noise. A specialist consultant is currently analysing the data on our behalf, in accordance with a protocol agreed with South Ayrshire Council and in relation to the concerns raised by Ms Spence. “This assessment and accompanying data will be shared with both South Ayrshire Council and Ms Spence in due course. “In the meantime we do require access to recover our specialist consultant’s equipment and hope Ms Spence will allow us to do so.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rolling back years troon class","story":"NewsRolling back the years for Troon class of \u002798Marr College pupils reunite for great hotel partyShare\u0026nbspByStephen Houston13:39, 8 AUG 2018Updated13:40, 8 AUG 2018NewsParty girls They loved catching up (Image: Lynda McFarlane)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore than 50 partying pupils rolled back the years to live life like it was 1998. Former pupils from Marr College took to the dance floor at the Marine Hotel last Saturday night to celebrate their 20-year reunion – those who would have started at the Troon school in 1992. There was lots of great banter, reminiscent 90s music and some interesting moves on the dancefloor. People had been sending old photos of themselves from back in the day which was collated into a slideshow. This ran throughout the night, showing that some people had hardly changed at all! Former pupils travelled from all over Scotland to meet old friends, some even came from England, America and as far a Hong Kong to join in the fun. It was a great night enjoyed by all those in attendance. A glass was raised to those from the year group who are no longer here and a “just giving” page was created for donations to be made to Cancer Research and the British Heart Foundation in their memory. DJ Steven James, was one of the pupils from the year group and did a great job spinning the decks and taking everyone back two decades. The event was staged by the now Lynda McFarlane, Mhairi Lammie (Miller) and Vicki Cameron.

An inn sprang up here known as the Brighous Inn and it was at this site that the famous Linton markets were first held.\nRobert Burns would visit Linton where he had a friend named Graham, the innkeeper at the Brighous. Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp. During their lifetime the sisters were very active in the village and did good work.

lists will be reviewed after research suggested over half of food items available for purchase in some establishments were high in fat or sugar.\nThe measures form part of efforts by the Ministry of Justice to boost the availability of and participation in sport and exercise across the youth justice system in England and Wales.\nMinisters unveiled the blueprint as they published the findings of an independent review into physical activity in jails.\nThe report, by Professor Rosie Meek, said: \u0026ldquoDiet and nutrition are not only important features of health promotion, they also have a direct impact on behaviour and mood.\nItems that prisoners can purchase with their own cash must go beyond confectionery, the paper added.\nWhile catered meals provided by the establishment are required to meet basic nutritional guidelines, inmates can purchase additional items known as \u0026ldquocanteen in adult jails and \u0026ldquotuck in youth facilities.\nThe report said healthy items are not routinely offered, or when they are, the cost compared to less healthy options is often a barrier.\nA review of lists of products that can be bought in public sector juvenile young offender institutions (YOIs) and one young adult YOI showed detainees can purchase from between 185 to 238 items, including condiments, breakfast cereals, snacks and drinks.\nProf Meek\u0026rsquos report said: \u0026ldquoAfter analysing these for sugar and fat content, I found that between 55%-57% of food items for purchase across these prisons were also high in fat, or sugar, or both.\nShe recommended that jails should offer nutritional advice as part of their physical activity and wellbeing provision, and promote a readily available range of healthy eating options.\nIn response, the Ministry of Justice said youth justice establishments will provide information about healthy living and lifestyles during the induction process.\nMenus and canteen sheets will be reviewed to ensure healthy options are available and promoted, while young inmates will get nutritional guidance so they can make \u0026ldquoinformed choices about the amount of fats, sugar and salt that they consume in their diet.\nIt comes after inspectors praised YOIs where boys can get sweets as a reward for good behaviour under \u0026ldquoincentives and earned privileges schemes.\nIn further steps, the MoJ said prison guidelines on physical activity would be reviewed and all young people will be screened by healthcare teams as part of their YOI induction.\nHowever, the department ruled out allowing boxing or martial arts-based activities in jails.\nThe 100-page independent review also suggested that adult establishments could offer protein supplements, bars and shakes, while\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquopeer-led yoga or spinning classes could be considered\u0026nbsp \u0026ldquowhere appropriate.\nProf Meek, from Royal Holloway, University of London, said utilisation of sport across prisons and youth custody is \u0026ldquoinconsistent and under-developed, with examples of good practice standing out because they are the exception.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoThere is already evidence that sport can have a positive impact on people in custody and I hope that the recommendations outlined in the review will help to improve the lives of people in our justice system.\nProf Meek said \u0026nbspshe regretted

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

For instance in Campbeltown Amelias, Food for Thought and Ceann Loch Diner are excluded.Neither of Campbeltown\u0026#8217s fish and chip shops are included, either in the listings or on the map, despite there being a map symbol for those takeaways.Many cyclists are inquisitive and will no doubt discover other options as the guide is just a starting point.The Caledonia Way may also appeal to motorised travellers as well as the self propelled.A separate concertina trip planner leaflet, inserted at the back of the book, shows a height cross section of the full route and is cross referenced to the accommodation providers.On the reverse of this route planner is a diagrammatic map, trip planning tool and mileage chart including a speech bubble stating: \u0026#8216Are there any more hills today.\u0026#8217The Offcomers \u0026#8211 Pete Martin and Janet Moss with their guidebook at the Campbeltown launch. 25_c31caledonia01_PeteMartin_Janet_Moss\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane august 3 2018","story":"In the days before rapid transatlantic flights, The Royal Mail Ship (RMS) Queen Elizabeth operated a weekly luxury liner service between Southampton and New York.A phone call, to the Southampton ferry and tug company Red Funnel, started a huge and challenging recovery exercise to refloat the 83,000 ton liner from the Bramble Bank.Tugs Canute, Clausentum, Neptune and Vulcan and Alexandra Towing Company\u0026#8217s Romey, Hornby and Poulsom were sent but soon it was realised more would be needed.Last week down memory lane featured the Royal Navy tug HMRT Bustler, a model of which is in Campbeltown museum.

Until it is obtained it has been decided to report just the top three times at this event.In line with previous Kintyre Wheelers Cycling Club time trials there was a sighting lap with competitors split into two groups.This gives the riders a chance to learn the three lap route and spot any potential hazards such as corners and lines in the mainly concrete surfaces.Once the event started, to speed up starts slightly riders were gridded up using the standard system of the slowest starting first either in pairs or in threes.The fastest go last as the aim is to bring everyone to the finish at about the same time.The wind had been increasing slightly and riders had strong crosswinds during the trial.Craig Armour took the top spot finishing in 26 minutes dead.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

And he claimed his attempts to repair his stricken vessel were scuppered by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), which denied him permission to move to nearby Cockenzie Harbour to carry out the work.  Mr Ramsay, who is from West Yorkshire, told the Courier: \"I think it is a disgrace that East Lothian has no contingency plan for shipwrecks despite being a fishing community.  \"I have been threatened and abused while staying at the beach at Prestonpans with my boat and when I managed to float it and asked for permission to move to Cockenzie Harbour I was refused by the MCA.  \"I\u0027ve lost everything, this was my home and I invested everything in it.

He set up camp on the beach as he looked into repairing the vessel but, while he initially said he received support from the local community, he told the Courier it did not last.  He said: \"I\u0027ve been abused and threatened by locals for staying at the beach.  \"My camp has some furniture which was donated by locals when I first arrived but since then I have been confronted by others angry that I am there.  \"I think it is shameful how I have been treated by this fishing community after becoming shipwrecked on their beach.\"  Mr Ramsay began breaking up the vessel last week, burning timber on the beach."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8124595.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cctv-considered-to-combat-foresters-park-vandals","story":"  Enjoyleisure, which manages the park on behalf of East Lothian Council, has confirmed it is looking at the possibility of introducing CCTV across the facility.  The announcement comes after another incident at the park saw goalposts broken and scorch marks left on the 3G and 2G pitches.  The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.  Two summers ago the park was hit twice by vandals in two weeks, again during July, with the \u0026lsquopie hut\u0026rsquo broken into and items stolen, as well as damage caused to the pitches and surrounding area.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoBoth the council and enjoyleisure are in talks about the possibility of introducing CCTV at Foresters Park so a decision will be taken on that in due course and local councillors will be kept updated.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that Foresters Park has unfortunately suffered some vandalism so the council\u0026rsquos Safer Communities Team continues to ensure that patrols cover the area regularly.  Earlier this month it was claimed on social media that young female players had been subjected to harassment from males as they trained at the park however, no formal complaints about any incident have been made to the council or police.  A council spokesperson added: \u0026ldquoWhile we are aware of vandalism issues, we have not been made aware of allegations of female players being harassed during training. If this is the case it would obviously be of concern so we will look into this as a matter of urgency.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

A report presented to East Lothian Licensing Board as a tool to help it set its policy placed East Lothian as 18th out of 30 local authorities for alcohol availability, but that figure rose to 13th out of 30 for number of on-sales and fell to 21st out of 30 for number of off-sales.  It also found that alcohol-related death rates were four times higher in neighbourhoods with the most outlets when compared to areas with the fewest in the county and crime rates were also two-and-a-half-times higher.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do?

In another step, canteen stock lists will be reviewed after research suggested over half of food items available for purchase in some establishments were high in fat or sugar.  The measures form part of efforts by the Ministry of Justice to boost the availability of and participation in sport and exercise across the youth justice system in England and Wales.  Ministers unveiled the blueprint as they published the findings of an independent review into physical activity in jails.  The report, by Professor Rosie Meek, said: \u0026ldquoDiet and nutrition are not only important features of health promotion, they also have a direct impact on behaviour and mood.  Items that prisoners can purchase with their own cash must go beyond confectionery, the paper added.  While catered meals provided by the establishment are required to meet basic nutritional guidelines, inmates can purchase additional items known as \u0026ldquocanteen in adult jails and \u0026ldquotuck in youth facilities.  The report said healthy items are not routinely offered, or when they are, the cost compared to less healthy options is often a barrier.  A review of lists of products that can be bought in public sector juvenile young offender institutions (YOIs) and one young adult YOI showed detainees can purchase from between 185 to 238 items, including condiments, breakfast cereals, snacks and drinks.  Prof Meek\u0026rsquos report said: \u0026ldquoAfter analysing these for sugar and fat content, I found that between 55%-57% of food items for purchase across these prisons were also high in fat, or sugar, or both.  She recommended that jails should offer nutritional advice as part of their physical activity and wellbeing provision, and promote a readily available range of healthy eating options.  In response, the Ministry of Justice said youth justice establishments will provide information about healthy living and lifestyles during the induction process.  Menus and canteen sheets will be reviewed to ensure healthy options are available and promoted, while young inmates will get nutritional guidance so they can make \u0026ldquoinformed choices about the amount of fats, sugar and salt that they consume in their diet.  It comes after inspectors praised YOIs where boys can get sweets as a reward for good behaviour under \u0026ldquoincentives and earned privileges schemes.  In further steps, the MoJ said prison guidelines on physical activity would be reviewed and all young people will be screened by healthcare teams as part of their YOI induction.  However, the department ruled out allowing boxing or martial arts-based activities in jails.  The 100-page independent review also suggested that adult establishments could offer protein supplements, bars and shakes, while\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquopeer-led yoga or spinning classes could be considered\u0026nbsp \u0026ldquowhere appropriate.  Prof Meek, from Royal Holloway, University of London, said utilisation of sport across prisons and youth custody is \u0026ldquoinconsistent and under-developed, with examples of good practice standing out because they are the exception.  She said: \u0026ldquoThere is already evidence that sport can have a positive impact on people in custody and I hope that the recommendations outlined in the review will help to improve the lives of people in our justice system.  Prof Meek said \u0026nbspshe regretted the decision to maintain the ban on martial arts in jails.

As part of the business restructuring, M\u0026ampS will also be looking to reduce its costs by \u0026pound350 million by 2021.  On Saturday, clothing stores in Northampton, Falkirk, Kettering, Newmarket, New Mersey Speke, Stockton and Walsall will trade for a final day \u0026ndash while a Simply Food in Bayswater, London, will also close.  Three stores in Fleetwood, Newton Abbott and Darlington have already ceased trading as part of the phase of closures.  Three more, in East Kilbride and Clacton and Holloway Road in London are expected to close at a later date.  The latest round of closures comes after 21 stores were wound up by the chain.  On Friday, Steve Rowe, M\u0026ampS chief executive, said: \u0026ldquoThere are likely to be more redundancies.  However, he said 86% of the staff working in the stores closed so far had been relocated within the business.

Here is everything you need to know:  The Perseid meteor shower is caused by debris falling from the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle when it comes into contact with the Earth\u0026rsquos atmosphere. The comet orbits the Sun every 133 years.  The meteors, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the atmosphere at 58 kilometres (36 miles) per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.  Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from 1,648 to 5,537C (3,000 to 10,000 Fahrenheit) as they speed across the sky.  The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.  The peak time for Perseid watching will be Sunday night and before dawn on Monday, but the meteors may already be making an appearance.  Dr Robert Massey, from the Royal Astronomical Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe shower will be visible all over the UK, as long as the skies are clear.  \u0026ldquoUnlike a lot of celestial events, meteor showers are easy to watch and no special equipment is needed, although a reclining chair and a blanket make viewing much more comfortable.  Affelia Wibisono, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said: \u0026ldquoObservers are in luck this year as it coincides with the moon setting shortly after sunset to leave a dark night sky.  \u0026ldquoThose who have perfect conditions may be able to see 80 meteors per hour \u0026ndash however, this is unlikely to be the case for most people, especially those in urban areas.  \u0026ldquoLight pollution greatly decreases the number of meteors visible so head out to the countryside and let your eyes become dark adapted by not looking at any bright lights for at least 15 minutes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8190065.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"in-pictures-the-golden-age-of-railways-as-uk-marks-anniversary-of-end-of-steam","story":"  The event will feature the 70013 Oliver Cromwell, which was used during the charter return trip from Liverpool to Carlisle via Manchester 50 years ago.

Ms Sturgeon said: \u0026ldquoOur supporters have yet again shown themselves to be perfect hosts and I want to thank them for the warm welcome athletes and teams from throughout Europe have received.  Ms Aitken added: \u0026ldquoThe atmosphere in Glasgow during the championships has been tremendous and the welcome that people all over the city have given to athletes and visitors alike has been typically friendly and enthusiastic.  \u0026ldquoAlthough it comes as absolutely no surprise, I couldn\u0026rsquot be more proud of the way the city has embraced our friends and neighbours from across Europe.  The comments come as Team Great Britain had one of its most successful days in the games yesterday, bringing home 10 medals.  Diver Jack Laugher received his second gold of the games for the 3m springboard competition, swimmer Ben Proud came first in the 50m freestyle and teammates Adam Peaty, Nicholas Pyle, James Guy and Duncan Scott worked together to nab the top prize in the men\u0026rsquos 4x100m medley relay.  Jess Learmonth got silver in the women\u0026rsquos triathlon, Matthew Dixon and Noah Williams came second in the synchronised 10m diving while swimmers Max Litchfield and Imogen Clark also gained silver in the 400m individual medley and the 50m breaststroke respectively.

As the athletes continue to shine on the global stage, their success has prompted sportscotland to confirm the first recipients of a \u0026pound500,000 legacy fund aimed at getting communities across the country more active.  More than 90 projects will share around \u0026pound250,000 as part of GO LIVE! GET ACTIVE, a programme designed to support Community Sport Hubs (CSHs) deliver a sporting legacy from the first ever multi-sport European Championships.  The Scottish Government funding, which is being invested by sportscotland, is supporting CSHs that establish new sport or physical activity sessions to target those most inactive in communities. It is also being used to fund projects that use sport and physical activity to improve health, wellbeing and social cohesion.  Minister for sport, Joe FitzPatrick, marked the funding awards by visiting Whitacres Community Sport Hub in Glasgow, which will receive \u0026pound4,590 to deliver a series of new boxing sessions for 16 to 25-year-old women and men over the age of 40.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis \u0026pound500,000 investment will build on the enthusiasm generated by Glasgow 2018, making a lasting difference in communities throughout the country, with a positive impact on the health of individuals while boosting community cohesion.  \u0026ldquoWhitacres Community Sport Hub is a perfect example of this. In particular, I\u0026rsquove been impressed by their boxing programme, which has achieved great success with women and older people.  Meanwhile, the games are also encouraging the city to take interest in an entirely new sport \u0026ndash golf.  As the only new event in the programme at Glasgow 2018, the historic event at Gleneagles is proving popular with fans, and those who can\u0026rsquot make it along in person are gathering in George Square and Glasgow Green to watch the action unfold.

The Rev Dr Richard Frater, convener of the Kirk\u0027s Churhc and Society Council, was one of the signatories to the letter which demands the policies are dropped and claim destitution deliberately inflicted by the UK Government is \u0026ldquoinhumane and leads to racial discrimination.  The policy has seen members of the Windrush generation of West Indian immigrants told to leave the country because they lacked official documentation, provoked a row over the planned eviction of hundreds of would-be refugees in Glasgow and complaints from the director of the leaders of Edinburgh\u0027s international festivals over heavy-handed treatment of visiting artists under Home Office Rules.  In an open letter to Home Secretary Sajid Javid, the churches describe the \"hostile environment\" as a web of government policies designed to make life so difficult for people who cannot prove they have the right to live in the UK that they will choose to leave. They warn the system is inhumane,unjust, and is causing racist discrimination.  The letter calls fror a full independent review of the immigration rules and how they are being enforced. It states: \"We believe it is inhumane to usedestituition or the treat of destitution as a policy tool to encourage people to leave the country.\"  Read more: 100 join protest against plans to evict asylum seekers  It continues: \"\u0026ldquoPeople who do not look or sound \u0026lsquoBritish\u0026rsquo are now facing increased difficulty in finding homes and employment, because landlords and employers are being asked to play the role of border guards.

Ms Sturgeon is due to update Holyrood on her plans for a referendum in October.  Last year, after resetting her original plans after SNP general election losses, she said she would set out a \u0026ldquoprecise timetable in the autumn.  However with continued confusion over the terms of Brexit and potential delays in talks, she admitted this week that she didn\u0026rsquot know what she would say.  Speaking to the BBC in Aberdeen, Mr Wheelhouse was asked about the likelihood of a second referendum being called in the current circumstances.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe First Minister said she will review the situation in October.  \u0026ldquoClearly, the chances of that happening are higher the more the UK government pushes us down a line of no deal and cutting our ties to\u0026hellip the European single market.  \u0026ldquoPeople who are not necessarily sympathetic to the SNP are increasingly angry with the position the UK government has taken and the risk of a \u0026lsquono deal\u0026rsquo is focusing people\u0027s minds on perhaps the better opportunities there may be through independence.\"  The pound rebounded on Thursday after a report EU leaders were mulling a compromise that would avoid a no-deal by letting the UK opt out of free movement, but stay in the single market for goods.  However the idea came with a big catch.  In return for the EU dropping its resistance to cherry picking parts of the single market, the UK would have to replicate all future EU rules on environment, customs and social protection.  As this would effectively prevent the UK \u0026ldquotaking back control, the trade-off is unlikely to be backed by Westminster, but it does at least suggest an openness to new thinking.  Meanwhile, Theresa May has been forced to reassure Conservative party members that her Chequers plan for a soft Brexit is not a sell-out to Brussels.  In a three-page letter addressing the \u0026ldquostrong feelings in the rank and file, the Prime Minister insisted her proposals were \u0026ldquoin no sense a concession to the EU.  However she also said Brexit \u0026ldquorequires pragmatism and compromise from both sides.  The exercise, estimated to have cost the Tory party around \u0026pound70,000, comes amid a grassroots backlash to the Chequers deal, which would see the UK maintain a common rule book with the EU on goods and agri-foods, but diverge on services and migration.  David Davis quit as Brexit Secretary and Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary after the plan was agreed last month, and it has been criticised by other Brexiters as a betrayal.  Mrs May admitted \u0026ldquoparty members have raised a number of questions about her plan for a bespoke deal, and she wanted to \u0026ldquoaddress them directly.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know that some people are concerned that this common rule book will stop us doing trade deals. I can assure you that this is not the case - and I would not be proposing it if it would.  She acknowledged a common rule book \u0026ldquowould mean we could not drop our regulatory standards for goods in new trade deals with other countries, but said the government didn\u0026rsquot want to do that anyway, as it wanted to \u0026ldquoprotect British consumers.  \u0026ldquoI am well aware of the strong feelings members of our Party have on this national issue.  In recent weeks, Downing Street has held briefing sessions for Tory branch chairs, with Mrs May taking part in a conference call Q\u0026ampA with association chairmen.  She insisted the UK would take back control of its money, laws and borders and begin \u0026ldquoan exciting new chapter in our nation\u0026rsquos history.  She rejected both the EU\u0026rsquos options, saying one would mean a separate status for Northern Ireland and \u0026ldquobreak up the UK, which was unacceptable to her as a \u0026ldquoproud Unionist.  She also said Norway-style membership of the European Economic Area would continue free movement, \u0026ldquovast annual payments and alignment with EU rules.  She said: \u0026ldquoI remain clear that no deal is better than a bad deal - and we are stepping up our \u0026lsquono deal\u0026rsquo preparations.

He said the language was experiencing a \u0026ldquoshift in emphasis away from its heartlands and towards the Central Belt as populations continue to plummet in Scotland\u0026rsquos most rural areas.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe numbers are growing in the cities and the bigger towns all the time. And that contrasts quite significantly with the economic situation \u0026ndash not just in the Western Isles, but in other areas of the Highlands as well.  It comes as a series of commitments aimed at boosting the strength of Gaelic were unveiled at a milestone meeting of public bodies chaired by Deputy First Minister John Swinney.  This includes plans to publish the first ever Gaelic tourism strategy this autumn to help bring visitors into contact with the language.  Officials also want to increase the number of school subjects which can be taught in Gaelic.  Mr MacDonald said the new plans represented a \u0026ldquomajor investment of time, energy and resources.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a recognition of the important of Gaelic language and culture to the tourism industry.

He said recent figures indicating the population of the Western Isles could plummet by as much as 14 per cent in the next 20 years were a \u0026ldquoreality check, but new plans sought to reverse the tide and strengthen Gaelic-speaking rural communities.  Mr Swinney said the Scottish Government had set out a \u0026ldquoclear mandate for the support of Gaelic.  He added: \u0026ldquoThis meeting shows that there are a variety of activities being undertaken by a wide range of public bodies across Scotland in support of the language and it is important that we capitalise upon this to move the agenda forward.  \u0026ldquoI am pleased that agreement has been made on these key commitments and I hope that we can all work together to develop further commitments in the coming months."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/4033618.jpg?type=article-full","title":"bbc-switch-off-campaign-goes-viral-but-is-the-publicly-funded-broadcaster-really-biased","story":"  Allegations of biased journalism within the publicly funded broadcaster have been historically made on both the left and right of the political spectrum.  But on Thursday a new social media campaign fuelled by a body of Scottish nationalists to boycott the BBC went viral, prompting a fresh discussion over whether the state broadcaster is biased.  The #BBCSwitchOff campaign is being supported by those who believe that the broadcaster is biased.  A fresh wave of protests began at 6pm on Thursday when it was suggested people switch off the BBC.  It was the number one trended hashtag on Twitter on Thursday across the UK with BBCBias also in the top ten. It was a similar story in Glasgow and Edinburgh.    One of the reasons for the campaign was the belief in some quarters that Jeremy Corbyn and left-of-centre politics is not getting a fair hearing on the Beeb.  Many Corbyn supporters were up in arms over an image of the Labour leader on Newsnight in March which they felt had been altered to look \u0026lsquomore Russian\u0026rsquo.    It came hot on the heels of Labour moving to defend Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s comments claiming the BBC is biased towards \u0027Israel\u0027s right to exist\u0027.  The Labour leader made the comments to Iranian state TV channel Press TV in 2011, when he was a backbencher.  On Thursday it appeared the BBC changed a headline on its story about Wednesday night\u0026rsquos attacks on Israel after the Board of Deputies angrily complained about its \u0026ldquoappalling stance on the issue.    The BBC\u0026rsquos original headline was \u0026ldquoIsraeli air strikes \u0026lsquokill woman and toddler\u0026rsquo, with no mention of the rocket attacks which came before the strikes.  On Thursday morning, the Board of Deputies tweeted: \u0026ldquoAppalling @BBCNews headline after Israel responded to *150* rockets fired at its towns by terrorists while families were asleep. We have complained and you should too, including a link to the BBC complaints page.      I truly thought the #BBCswitchoff was a Scottish thing....nice to see the rest of the UK has awoken to what we\u0027ve put up with for years....and nobody believed us back then.....      Will BBC report that #BBCswitchoff is trending at number one? We\u0027ll never know. #BBCswitchoff  The BBC subsequently changed its headline to \u0026ldquoGaza airstrikes \u0026lsquokill woman and child\u0026rsquo after rockets hit Israel.  The Board subsequently said this headline was \"better... but it\u0026rsquos still an inversion\".  \"Israel\u0026rsquos cities were struck by 150 rockets, sending tens of thousands in to shelters. Surely the headline should reflect this, it said.    A BBC spokesperson said: \"\u0026ldquoAlthough the original headline was not factually incorrect, we updated it to add more context to the story.  The Twitter\u0026nbspcampaign has been adopted by people outwith Labour activists, including a body of Scottish independence supporters.  Famously hundreds of Yes supporters held a demonstration outside BBC Scotland\u0027s headquarters over alleged bias in the network\u0027s coverage of the independence referendum in September, 2014.    And last week, the BBC moved to deny political bias after a pro-independence blogger criticised the public broadcaster after his YouTube channel was shut down in a copyright row.      wow not only is #BBCswitchoff number 1` now . its also the most tweeted in the last 4 hours and the 13th in the psast 24 hours . Well done guys keep it up.      Amused by #BBCswitchoff hashtag. We in Scotland have been mocked for complaining about warped @BBC reporting for years. #misreportingScotland @BBCScotlandNews  Stuart Campbell, who runs the Wings Over Scotland channel, claimed his channel was closed without warning after the publicly funded BBC complained about 13 videos that had been uploaded to it.  The channel of another prominent independence campaigner, Peter Curran, was also shut down after BBC copyright complaints.  Meanwhile it was demonstrated that the BBC had not taken similar action with other political sites that used its material.    The BBC halted its action while it reviewed its copyright enforcement responses and the channel was reinstated.  It was reinstated by YouTube while the BBC said it will review its actions.  While the organisation is required to provide impartial coverage, 40 per cent of people feel this isn\u0026rsquot the case \u0026ndash according to a poll in May by BMG Research.  BMG asked 1,005 British adults if they consider the BBC to be politically neutral, and just 37 per cent of them said they did.  But nobody can quite make up their mind why.      So here we go....people who are tired of #bbcbias get a chance to join the #BBCswitchoff tonight at 6pm starting with the @bbcnews.

They dont even try to hide it anymore.#BBCBias pic.twitter/qYzJYtVSNA  A combined 22 per cent of respondents felt it was either somewhat or strongly biased towards left-wing views, while 18 per cent felt it was somewhat or strongly biased towards the right. Nearly a quarter of people said they just didn\u0026rsquot know.    Last week the BBC withdrew an educational film about immigration following complaints that it was biased.  The film, aimed at GCSE pupils, contained claims that Britain was \u0027multicultural long before curry and carnival\u0027 and that debate over immigration had fuelled a \u0027huge rise\u0027 in support for far-Right politics.  It was pulled from circulation and removed from YouTube after complaints that it broke impartiality rules.  Last week it emerged BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos flagship news and current affairs programme, Today, which for decades has set the agenda for the media-political elite, has been haemorrhaging listeners.    According to figures released by RAJAR, the official body for the monitoring of radio audiences, the programme has lost more than 800,000 listeners over the past year.      #BBCswitchoff The difference between the Boris coverage and the Corbyn coverage is a classic illustration of #bbcbias      Fight back against #BBCBias from 6 pm this evening :    1 Switch off the BBC at 6.    2.Join the Twitter storm about BBC Tory Propoganda bias    3.Always use the hashtag #BBCSwitchOff it\u0027s case sensitive. little people can change things too it\u0027s#BBCSwitchOff pic.twitter/aDz0ZZscgr  The BBC noted that audiences for news and current affairs programmes fluctuate over time, and suggested a \u0026ldquoquieter news agenda partly explained the drop-off.  But Tom Mills, a lecturer in sociology at Aston University and the author of The BBC: Myth of a Public Service says it may be because \"liberals and leftists have finally given up on the programme\".  Accusations of a left-wing bias were often made against the BBC by members of Margaret Thatcher\u0027s 1980s Conservative government.    Norman Tebbit called the BBC the Stateless Person\u0027s Broadcasting Corporation because of what he regarded as its unpatriotic and neutral coverage of the Falklands War, and Conservative MP Peter Bruinvels called it the Bolshevik Broadcasting Corporation.  Nine years ago, BBC director general, Greg Dyke, criticised the BBC as part of a \"Westminster conspiracy\" to maintain the British political system.  Nigel Farage has previously attacked the organisation for being too left-wing, and Leave voters accused Question Time of deliberately picking \u0026lsquoless intelligent Leavers\u0026rsquo for a TV audience last year.      Dear @BBCNews please explain to me how Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos outrageous and racist rhetoric is just \u0026ldquosilly language but despite Corbyn\u0026rsquos lifelong fight against racism, you are happy to basically compare him to Hitler? #BBCBias #boycott https://t.co/4pxY6Opexe  The BBC last month defended its Brexit coverage after being accused the corporation of \"journalistic cowardice\" in its reporting of the EU Referendum and its aftermath.  In response, James Stephenson, news editor at BBC News, said it had \u0026ldquoreported on every aspect of the [Brexit] story over the past two years.  He added: \u0026ldquoThere can be few times in the BBC\u0026rsquos history when its journalism has mattered more. This is not an organisation frightened of journalism, but committed to it.  BBC\u0027s Europe editor last year hit out at claims the broadcaster is biased against Brexit - claiming they have been blocked from holding European officials to the same standard they hold British officials to.    Speaking to BBC\u0027s News Watch programme, which monitors complaints about the broadcaster, Katja Adler, the BBC\u0027s Europe editor, addressed claims of spreading \"doom and gloom\".  Ms Adler, who is based in Brussels, said she understands viewers who see this perceived bias and complain the BBC unfairly portrays the British side of the talks.  She explained: \"It is a fair comment to make.  \"It is my job to put across the European perspective, which may come across anti-Brexit.  \"But this is all because, since the Brexit talks started, there has been silence enforced inside the EU Commission and among EU leaders, in order to only let Michel Barnier speak about Brexit.  \"We do not have the same access to talk to the same players as we do on the British side to put the difficult questions to them.  \"That can be very frustrating for our viewers, and it can seem like we are not doing our job, but the players just do not let us interview them on the record, so they end up being sources or insiders.\"  She said this led to the EU officials not being held to the same level of scrutiny as those in Britain, but insisted reporters in Brussels were trying their best to hold them to account.  The BBC were approached for comment on the Twitter campaign."},{"url":null,"title":"scientists-reveal-how-blue-light-from-smartphones-accelerates-blindness","story":"  Research by the University of Toledo in the US has revealed that prolonged exposure to blue light triggers poisonous molecules to be generated in the eye\u0026rsquos light-sensitive cells that can cause macular degeneration \u0026ndash an incurable condition that affects the middle part of vision.  Blue light, which has a shorter wavelength and more energy compared to other colours, can gradually cause damage to the eyes.  Dr Ajith Karunarathne, an assistant professor in the university\u0026rsquos Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, said: \u0026ldquoWe are being exposed to blue light continuously and the eye\u0026rsquos cornea and lens cannot block or reflect it.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos no secret that blue light harms our vision by damaging the eye\u0026rsquos retina.  \u0026ldquoOur experiments explain how this happens, and we hope this leads to therapies that slow macular degeneration, such as a new kind of eye drop.  Macular degeneration, which affects around 2.4% of the adult population in the UK, is a common condition among those in their 50s and 60s that results in significant vision loss.  It is caused by the death of photoreceptor, ie light-sensitive cells in the retina.  Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the US and while it does not cause total blindness, AMD can make everyday activities such as reading and recognising faces difficult.  Photoreceptor cells need molecules called retinal to sense light and trigger signalling to the brain, enabling us to see.  The researchers found that being exposed to blue light causes retinal to set a chain of reactions that leads to toxic chemical molecules to be created in the photoreceptor cells.  Kasun Ratnayake, a PhD student at the University of Toledo who was involved in the study, said: \u0026ldquoIf you shine blue light on retinal, the retinal kills photoreceptor cells as the signalling molecule on the membrane dissolves.  \u0026ldquoPhotoreceptor cells do not regenerate in the eye. When they\u0026rsquore dead, they\u0026rsquore dead for good.  The researchers found that introducing retinal molecules to other cell types in the body, such as cancer cells, heart cells and neurons, caused them to die off when exposed to blue light.  They also noticed that blue light alone or retinal without blue light had no effect on cell.  Dr Karunarathne said: \u0026ldquoThe retinal-generated toxicity by blue light is universal. It can kill any cell type.  The scientists found that a molecule called alpha tocopherol, a natural antioxidant found in the eye and body, stops the cells from dying but fails to offer any protection to the ageing population or those whose immune systems have been suppressed.  Dr Karunarathne said: \u0026ldquoThat is when the real damage occurs.  For those wanting to protect their eyes from blue light, Dr Karunarathne advises wearing sunglasses that can filter both UV and blue light outside and avoiding browsing on mobile phones or tablets in the dark.  The research is published in the journal Scientific Reports."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-traffic-free-days-in-edinburgh-city-centre","story":"  Councillors have approved an eight-week consultation beginning in September which sets out ideas including pedestrianised streets, widened pavements and regular vehicle-free days.  The Open Streets programme would see key parts of the city centre closed to traffic on the first Sunday of every month from 10am to 5pm.  Based on similar, successful schemes in Paris and New York, the report says it would \"help citizens experience the city in a quieter, more people-focused environment\".

The future once looked so bright. A series of marquee acquisitions over a 50-year period in the middle of the 20th century saw the company\u0027s portfolio blossom, offering customers an everything-under-one-roof shopping experience that allowed people to browse for wedding gifts, homeware, beauty products and designer clothes, all within the same four walls.  It was a far cry from its humble beginnings as a small drapery shop in Glasgow in 1849, the brainchild of farmer\u0027s son Hugh Fraser and small business owner James Arthur.  The name Arthur \u0026amp Fraser was born, and could be found on the corner of Argyle Street and Buchanan Street in the Scottish city.  A century later, and after the wholesale business splintered from the retail side, the firm had grown to become a national chain known as House of Fraser.  It would go on to acquire numerous other businesses as its stores emerged bruised and bloodied but emboldened from the Second World War, from clothes broker Brown Muff \u0026amp Co in Yorkshire to Dingles drapery shop in Plymouth.  Harrods, too, would become part of the House of Fraser family in the late 1950s. Then, in 1985, the company was bought by Egyptian-born tycoon Mohamed Al Fayed and its profile soared further.  But trouble was afoot.  By January 1997, new chief executive John Coleman delivered on his promise to sell three stores - with the loss of 1,000 jobs - having been hit by a slump in the womenswear market and \"poor buying policies\".  A slight increase in sales the following year was not enough to drag the company into the black, and House of Fraser would go on to mortgage some retail estates to raise money for store revamps.  A further rise in like-for-like sales at the turn of the millennium gave cause for optimism, new store openings and the creation of hundreds of new jobs.  It would go on to acquire more regional chains, such as Jenners and Beatties, but the company\u0027s wheels had started to come off by the time it was bought by Chinese conglomerate Sanpower Group for nearly \u0026pound500 million in 2014.  The rise of discount stores such as Primark and Poundland, and the growth of internet shopping through sites such as Amazon, had already been credited as a contributory factor for hastening the demise of several high street staples.  Finally, after signalling that its future looked bleak, House of Fraser announced on Friday that it had fallen into administration, endangering the future of 17,000 staff.  As of June, the group had 59 locations across the UK and Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-duncan-smith-says-employers-have-not-bothered-to-look-at-british-workers","story":"  Speaking on Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme, the former work and pensions secretary blamed employers for not hiring British workers and dismissed business chiefs\u0026rsquo call for immigration targets to be scrapped after Brexit.  Instead, he said a system of work permits should be extended to all foreign workers wanting to come to the UK.  \u0026ldquoA lot of employers simply have not even bothered to try and find UK people to work, he said.  \u0026ldquoI think the best thing to do is work with what we have got and make it work for everyone around the world, he said. \u0026ldquoYou basically extend the work permit process across the EU and the rest of the world.  \u0026ldquoPeople can come here for work but they need to have work to come to and that work needs to have been agreed and accepted that there isn\u0026rsquot a person in the UK that could do that work and has the skills to do that work.  Mr Duncan Smith, the founder of the troubled universal credit benefits scheme currently being rolled out, went on to claim the current welfare system was distorting the employment market.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos happened is access to benefits, including child benefits even if you don\u0026rsquot have your children with you, has distorted the whole system around them being able to offer much cheaper wages and have them completely topped up.  \u0026ldquoIn the last year figures were available, and this is important, more than \u0026pound4.1 billion was spent on people from the EU who have come over here getting tax credits, child benefits, housing benefits. That\u0026rsquos one of the great pull factors.  \u0026ldquoLeaving the EU, we should not be offering for people to come over here just looking for work and to claim benefits.  \u0026ldquoWe need a living wage that does not require people to come over here and claim benefits to top up.  But the CBI, representing business leaders across the UK, has called for politicians to recognise the value of immigration to the UK economy, which they said should include scrapping immigration targets after Brexit.  Businesses need a new immigration policy, avoiding visas for EU citizens and putting migration on the table for trade talks, according to the CBI\u0026rsquos new report\u0026nbspOpen And Controlled \u0026ndash A New Approach To Migration.  Evidence from\u0026nbsp129,000 firms across 18 industry sectors in the report showed the importance of migration at all skill levels, said CBI deputy director-general\u0026nbspJosh Hardie.  He called for \u0026ldquoblunt targets to be axed to enable companies to hire the staff they need.  \u0026ldquoThis is no longer a theoretical debate, he said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos about the future of our nation. Openness and control must not be presented as opposites.  \u0026ldquoScrapping blunt targets, ensuring all who come to the UK contribute and using the immigration dividend to support public services will add to public confidence.  \u0026ldquoMany sectors are already facing shortages, from nurses to software engineers \u0026ndash so fast, sustainable, evidence-based action is needed.  The report highlights how businesses do not just need \u0026ldquothe brightest and best immigrants, but different skill levels across many different sectors.  Mr Hardie outlined the contribution made by EU immigrants to building Britain\u0026rsquos houses \u0026ndash from labourers and electricians to architects \u0026ndash and in food and drink, starting with farm workers, through logistics and into hospitality.  \u0026ldquoThe stakes couldn\u0026rsquot be higher, he said. \u0026ldquoGet it wrong, and the UK risks having too few people to run the NHS, pick fruit or deliver products to stores around the country.  \u0026ldquoThis would hurt us all \u0026ndash from the money in our pockets to our access to public services.  \u0026ldquoThe needs are more complex than only ensuring that the UK can attract the \u0026lsquobrightest and best\u0026rsquo.  He also called for greater migration to be part of future trade negotiations to allow the UK economy to grow, as well as reform of the non-EU immigration system of visas.  \u0026ldquoFor Global Britain to succeed, the UK must send the right signals that show it remains open and welcoming to the world, he said.  \u0026ldquoThat means putting migration on the table in trade talks to get us a better deal, first with the EU and then other countries, where it is clear existing visa restrictions inhibit trade and foreign direct investment.  Black Country MP John Spellar, an occasional Labour Brexiteer rebel, criticised the CBI for \u0026ldquosticking plaster remedies for a failure to train British workers.  \u0026ldquoBleating Bosses should do more training of youngsters and workers in the UK rather than relying on bringing in workers from the EU, he said.  \u0026ldquoAs an example they cite nurses, yet the Tory Government and useless NHS Bureaucrats cut training numbers, denying thousands of hopeful youngsters of the chance of a fulfilling career.  \u0026ldquoRecruiting from abroad has been a sticking plaster over their failure in this and many other sectors, and it\u0026rsquos time to call a halt.  Businesses need to win public support for an open immigration policy, said immigration think tank British Future\u0026rsquos director Sunder Katwala, calling for \u0026ldquobigger changes.  \u0026ldquoOur post-Brexit immigration system will need to win public support and restore confidence in how we manage immigration, he said.  \u0026ldquoPeople do see the gains for the economy of skilled and student migration \u0026ndash but people are worried about the scale of migration in lower-skilled work.  \u0026ldquoThe public sees the referendum as a reset moment \u0026ndash so they are expecting bigger changes than the CBI is proposing."},{"url":null,"title":"call-for-inquiry-into-jobs-for-the-boys-university-principal-appointment","story":"  The move by the UCU Scotland lecturers union comes after Professor John Harper was made principal of Robert Gordon University, in Aberdeen.  Mr Harper was appointed after the former principal unexpectedly stepped down following a conflict of interest row.  In a letter to Mike Cantlay, chair of the Scottish Funding Council, the UCU said the appointment breached the code of good governance for Scottish higher education.  The letter, from Mary Senior, the union\u0026rsquos Scotland official, said: \u0026ldquoI want to raise with you our deep concerns about the apparent lack of any open appointment process.  \u0026ldquoWe are concerned that this seemingly overnight elevation of one of the  vice principals to the position on a permanent basis does not sit well with good governance nor with equal opportunities principles.  \u0026ldquoWe want to be proud of our universities, but misguided decisions like this one damage that reputation and do nothing to give staff and students confidence in those leading our institutions. We would ask for your views and intervention on this matter.  The Scottish Code of Good Higher Education Governance states that  governing bodies are expected to ensure that the appointment process for principals \u0026ldquoenables student, staff and trade union input to be taken into account.  Ms Senior said she was not aware of an open appointment process having been conducted with student, staff or trade union input.  And she said the importance of following the correct procedure was to introduce greater diversity into senior university management - which is dominated by white males.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe cannot see how automatically promoting one white male vice-principal, is open, transparent or fair in any sense.  \u0026ldquoIt denies a whole range of other individuals \u0026ndash women and men \u0026ndash the opportunity to apply for this highly paid, important leadership role.  However, Mike Fleming, chair of the university\u0026rsquos board of governors, denied there had been any breach of the code.  In a message to staff he said: \u0026ldquoI would like to reassure you that the appointment was in line with the university\u0026rsquos procedures and complies with the code of good governance.  \u0026ldquoThere was full involvement of the board in the appointment and the governors were unanimous in their decision to ask John to step up to the role of principal.

More time to do couply stuff.!  The added bonus of advancing years is that men slow down their lager intake. Thus, dinner party dribbling is diminished. (Dribbling confined to sleep, and that little morning incontinence). Indeed, age and less drink means females can often hear meaningful sentences being constructed.  What age offers, paradoxically, is we men develop an even greater immaturity. The pressures of career pursuit and back-breaking finance having subsided, this frees up the older fella to reclaim his inner (That\u0026rsquoll Be The Day period) David Essex.

Short answer: it\u0026rsquos the silly season and it was either this or Nine Fun Things To Do With A Broken Lawnmower.  Longer answer: because there is something worth noting in the study published in Science Advances, so step away from the lawnmower for now.\u0026nbsp  On a purely primitive level it is no surprise that men were attracted to younger women.  It\u0026rsquos the law of the jungle, Darwin, survival of the most fertile and all that.  The male of the species is genetically programmed to mate with the female that will give him the best chance of continuing his line.  Similarly, a woman might see in an older male more protection for her offspring. We are all animals in essence, a mere hop, skip and a knuckle drag away from being the stars of Sir David Attenborough\u0026rsquos next documentary series.\u0026nbsp  READ MORE:\u0026nbspSNP politician named UK\u0027s sexiest MP in controversial poll  There is more to modern man and woman than procreative impulses, however.  Otherwise, dating would not have moved on from the days of early man dragging early woman back to the cave to see his etchings.  As any student of anthropology knows, that only goes on today in the wilder reaches of the planet. Like Dundee, say.  Clearly, there is something more complex going on here that makes men more popular the closer they get to 50.  Pity, for instance. Choosing older males could be a selfless act on the part of the women to make men feel better about themselves.  Women do this all the time. Not just with men, but with other women, children, and small animals. No, no, we\u0026rsquoll say, you\u0026rsquore not losing your hair it\u0026rsquos just your forehead that\u0026rsquos receding.

Oh Rover, next door\u0026rsquos cat really isn\u0026rsquot sniggering at you, it\u0026rsquos just the way his cheek flaps fall.\u0026nbsp  There could be something similar going on with all those men preferring younger women to older ones. Older women are busy, accomplished, lots to do. They don\u0026rsquot have the time to court men, whereas younger women are always looking for a project. They could strip back their furniture or take on some kindly older gent for trips to the theatre and so on.  It\u0026rsquos charity, like saving the whales.\u0026nbsp  Anyway, why shouldn\u0026rsquot men be more attracted to younger women?\u0026nbsp  From painting to literature, from time immemorial to today, new has always had a certain allure over old.\u0026nbsp  Who would not want to be with someone who thinks they are original, witty, accomplished, who looks at you with wide eyes that melt in the sunshine of your smile? It\u0026rsquos the closest thing to marrying a Golden Retriever, and who wouldn\u0026rsquot want that.\u0026nbsp  What the survey does not show is the power of one quality in particular to turn all other findings on their head.\u0026nbsp  A great relationship does not stand or fall on looks.

His comments came as Ms Sturgeon visited Turriff Show, Scotland’s second biggest agricultural event after the Royal Highland Show.                                                    Mr Chapman has written to Transport Scotland to seek clarity after local officials suggested that the bypass would be granted “special road” status, excluding agricultural vehicles.        The issue was highlighted by NFU Scotland during a round table discussion at the New Deer Show last month and farmers are concerned they will have difficulty transporting livestock, particularly those making the journey from Ellon to the other side of the city at Portlethen.Mr Chapman, who is also a farmer, said the situation also raises the question of increased greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural vehicles being forced to travel through the city.He said: “My view is that this road is not a motorway, it is a dual carriageway and therefore tractors should be permitted to travel along the route.“I have written to Transport Scotland, but I have yet to receive a response. I would urge Nicola Sturgeon to speak up on behalf of our local farmers so that common sense can prevail and this ill-thought ban is lifted.”                                                                                                        Local SNP MSP Gillian Martin said that a public consultation regarding the route had been carried out in 2007 although views can still be put to Transport Scotland.She added: “I believe the NFU Scotland did submit to that. It’s unclear whether a call for access to agricultural vehicles was included in their submission at that point.

Some eight years and \u0026#65533120,000 later, that goal has now been achieved.      \t                                                             The independence celebrations will be marked here in Scotland by Polish people across the country.                                                    And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

People with physical, vision and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete.\u0026ldquoThis is a golden opportunity for local groups, individuals and businesses to raise awareness to their cause and raise funds from their stalls on the day, he said. \u0026ldquoWe are hoping the event will showcase Caithness in a positive way for tourism, business and the community.Sixty para-athletes will travel from as far afield as America and Australia and all over the UK to take part in the milestone event. The Mey Games will be unique as it welcomes both para and Invictus athletes to compete in traditional Highland track-and-field competitions. This will be the first time that para-athletics has been included within a traditional Highland Games context in Scotland.America\u0026rsquos Alex \u0026ldquoThe Tank Armor, who holds the world record for wheelchair caber-tossing, as well as several top Australian para-athletes will be competing.Last year saw a revamped games event held at John O\u0026rsquoGroats, with Prince Charles \u0026ndash known as the Duke of Rothesay in Scotland \u0026ndash in attendance.The duke \u0026ndash whose late grandmother, the Queen Mother, regularly attended the games during her summer stays at the Castle of Mey \u0026ndash did an impromptu tour of the various marquees on the site to chat with local organisations and vendors.Capt Otley \u0026ndash who is also chairman of the Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch of Royal British Legion Scotland (RBLS) \u0026ndash said that all proceeds from the games will be going towards supporting the veterans and their families within the branch area. There will be in the region of 15 marquees this year, including seven new ones as a result of successful applications to local community benefit funds.\u0026ldquoThe Mey Games is now a major annual event in Caithness, Capt Otley said.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos organised by the Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch of the RBLS who took on the running of the games when visitor numbers were dwindling to as low as just 30. Last year, we had 1500 visitors and this year we hope to welcome between 2500 and 3500 people.\u0026ldquoWe are all volunteers and work hard to ensure the event is a big success. It\u0026rsquos a community event and we want the local community to be part of it. We offer free stalls to local businesses as we want to encourage them to be involved.\u0026ldquoAt the RBLS we provide a lot of veteran support and our ethos is focused on military support and participation inclusion.\u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have so many para-athletes taking part this year from around the globe. A delegation from the RBLS Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch visited Australia in April this year to mark Anzac Day so it\u0026rsquos fitting that we will have a number of Australian para-athletes taking part.\u0026ldquoWe want to make sure each of the para-athletes and everybody at the games has an enjoyable time.He stressed how the games have been \u0026ldquoramped up by comparing the number of marquees this year with the total put up two years ago, only three.\u0026ldquoThere has been a massive amount of work behind the scenes by a dedicated group of members to ensure the games not only takes place but grows to a more sustainable level.The build-up to the Mey Games will get under way with a North Coast 500 cycling challenge that will depart from Wick\u0026rsquos Market Square on July 28 and arrive back in the town on August 3, the day before the games.On the morning of the games, at 9.30am, there will be a rededication ceremony at the grave of General Lord Horne in Wick cemetery. \u0026ldquoWe shall honour Wick\u0026rsquos own hero of the Great War with a colour party and piper in attendance at this short but poignant event, Capt Otley said.Events kicks off at 11am and include Highland dancing competitions, pipe and drum bands, the tug of war, dog show and live music, as well as various exhibitions, local art, crafts and food stalls.The event will take place at John O\u0026rsquoGroats for the third time after travel company Natural Retreats stepped in after the previous games location, close to the Castle of Mey, became waterlogged.Since then the company has continued to provide ongoing complimentary use of the showground.Ewan Kearney, chief operating officer at Natural Retreats, said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted to support the Mey Games again this year.For more information, visit the Mey Games Facebook page: https://www.facebook/MeyGames/Saturday 11 Aug 2018 10:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116890.jpg","title":"Prince Charles to launch Highland Games initiative","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe decided to act after seeing a steady decline in athletes taking part in the Mey Games, which he has attended every year since 2002.The prince \u0026ndash known as the Duke of Rothesay when in Scotland \u0026ndash hopes the initiative will provide a more secure and better future for the games.Robert Lovie of The Prince\u0026rsquos Foundation, which is involved in the proposal, said the prince was aware of a lack of competition in the heavy and other traditional events at the Mey Games.\u0026ldquoHe was aware of it and wanted to do something about it, Mr Lovie, the foundation\u0026rsquos director of outreach, said.\u0026ldquoThe prince has had an interest in Highland Games since he was a little boy and attended the Braemar Gathering.

Then, despite repeated promises over the last year, ministers failed to reach an agreement that would allow Road Equivalent Tariff to be introduced on external ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“This has left people in Orkney angry and frustrated, not least as we see another tourism season come and go with no sign of the cheaper fares. Worse still, there has been no indication from the Scottish Government what steps it is taking to try to unlock this impasse.“The transport secretary must set out clearly what he has done and plans to do to reach a resolution. He must also reaffirm that any fare reductions will be backdated to the end of June this year as previously promised. The funding has been set aside and must benefit those using these lifeline services.“While Mr Matheson is new in post, he must treat this issue as a priority. He must know that the longer this shambles goes on, the worse it reflects on him and the government.”A Scottish Government spokesperson responded: “We remain committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles and are currently undertaking further work on the issue. As a first step, we have cut fares on the Aberdeen to Lerwick and Kirkwall to Lerwick services by around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

pub in Fortrose is up for sale with an asking price of nearly half a million pounds.The Anderson bar and restaurant, featuring 13-guest rooms, nine of which are en-suite, is up for grabs for \u0026pound449,995.The traditional black-and-white inn dates from 1840s, however the cellars are believed to be older.Owners Jim And Anne Anderson say they are ready to move on after raising their son, who is now 18 and heading to university, in the hotel, which they purchased in 2003.The couple, who emigrated from Philadelphia, also have a home on the Black Isle.Mr Anderson (61) said the property was \"a viable family business in a setting that was a great place for a family to live and raise their children\".He said he would sell it as a house or as a hotel business but added: \"If I could pick and choose our buyer I would say it would be someone a lot like us who would have a vision of where they want to take it. It\u0026rsquos a flexible industry.

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Saturday 11 Aug 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The number of property viewings conducted by Galbraith in the Highlands has increased from 167 this time last year to 216 in 2018, a rise of 29 per cent.Increased demand has also seen the average time taken to sell property drop by 21 per cent since last year.Phiddy Robertson, who handles residential sales for Galbraith in Inverness, revealed that the average price of property sold from the firm\u0026rsquos Inverness office during the quarter rose 14.8 per cent from \u0026pound284,992 in the previous quarter to \u0026pound327,21\"The market has picked up significantly since 2015 and in 2018 the first six months show a steady increase in activity,\" she said.\"Demand for well-sited property remains high, with competition leading to more closing dates, most of which achieve significant premiums over the asking price, while there is also greater movement at the top end of the residential market.\"The region continues to be a draw for new residents moving in from outside the area.\"While prices are rising, the Highland area remains less expensive than many other parts of the UK and we see buyers from all over the country making the move here to enjoy a better quality of life,\" Ms Robertson added.The UK government House Price Index for May 2018 noted that the largest regional increase in sales by volume in Scotland was for the Highland region, where volumes increased by 3.9 per cent on the previous year.Currently on the market with Galbraith in Inverness are the following properties:The Galbraith letting department for Inverness also enjoyed a busy quarter.The number of relets agreed increased by 25 per cent compared with the previous quarter. Viewings also increased by five per cent for rental properties and the average time taken to find a tenant for a rental property was just six days.Sarah Hazzard, who manages lettings for Galbraith in Inverness, said: \"We find that both city-centre properties and well-presented cottages in rural areas are snapped up soon after becoming available.\"Landlords are able to increase the rents they charge between tenancies due to the very limited supply of rental property in Inverness-shire and the very strong demand from tenants. We offer a full service which takes the hassle away from the owner and gives them peace of mind that we will manage the whole lettings process, ensure the rent is paid, and find the best possible tenant.\"Saturday 11 Aug 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

That\u0026rsquos why this is important.\"It\u0026rsquos being set up so we can say to everyone \u0026lsquowe are part of society, we are here, we\u0026rsquore just people, there\u0026rsquos nothing scary about us, we\u0026rsquore just like everybody else, out to have a bit of fun\u0026rsquo.\"The forum, supporting people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex is seeking permission from Highland Council to stage the October 6 march.Eden Court in Inverness will be the main event hub with stalls in the foyer, and lectures, exhibitions, screenings and debates in the La Scala Cinema and the MacLean Room.Fringe events will take place on other dates across the Highlands including Portree on August 25 and Ullapool on September 1.The spokeswoman from Highland LGBTI said it aimed to break barriers, spread awareness and create a show of solidarity for the LGBTI community.She knows first-hand how daunting it is for people to \"come out\", but her experience in Inverness was positive.She said rural areas sometimes tell a different story.\"Inverness is not too bad,\" she said. \"But if you go further afield it gets more difficult. I have been to a college fresher\u0026rsquos fair on Skye. They invite us each year and we have a stall, which is great.\"The people that we meet have no problems at all. But it\u0026rsquos quite interesting what you see when you\u0026rsquore on the stall.\"People walk down the stalls and then take a wide berth when they are going past our stall, and then continue. \"She added: \"The general public reaction can be quite funny because they\u0026rsquore not sure, they don\u0026rsquot know what to say to us, they do not understand \u0026ndash and that is one of the things we want to try and help people with. We want to help people to understand what LGBTI is and understand the terminology.\"The last known gay pride demonstration in Inverness was in 2002.Eden Court chief executive James Mackenzie-Blackman, who relocated from London in October to take on the theatre\u0026rsquos top role, strongly welcomed the forthcoming Proud Ness event.He said: \"My absolute position is that this is brilliant \u0026ndash and how exciting that something like this is happening in the Highlands.\"Saturday 11 Aug 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

But it has lodged an application in the hope permission will be in place to begin as soon as the funding target is met.The plans feature a cinema seating roughly 30 people and hosting weekly screenings, rising to twice-weekly in the summer.It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing annual film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country.Cromarty Estate plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema to cater for growing business demand.A spokesman said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation.

At the start we were worried she wouldn\u0026rsquot make it.\"While Spirtle was stranded she suffered dehydration and sunburn and photographs taken at the time showed the extent of her injuries.Recently, she was photographed with her mother Porridge, sister Honey and a new-born calf believed to also belong to Porridge.Whale and Dolphin Conservation officer Charlie Phillips photographed the \"well-known\" family last week while on Dolphin Spirit\u0026rsquos Mischief RIB. He has been helping to monitor Spirtle and was happy to see another improvement in her.\"The white area is getting smaller and smaller as it heals and the dolphin\u0026rsquos melanin turns it grey,\" he said. \"In a couple of years we may not see any white on her at all.\"Saturday 11 Aug 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this. The guys just said they were acting on instructions.\"Hamish Mackenzie of Tarbat Community Council wrote to Highland Council chief executive Steve Barron back in June after receiving apologies in January from local authority community services staff for the lack of warning.They said the equipment was removed on health and safety grounds \u0026ndash a reason given in other similar instances across the region.However Mr Mackenzie says follow-up enquiries for details about land ownership and the legalities of the situation have not been responded to months later.\"The first choice is to get Highland Council to continue to maintain the park in accordance with the original agreement. People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid. Let\u0026rsquos hope the community gets a quick turnaround and are able to buy the equipment needed and get it ready for next summer.\"Highland Council was approached for comment but had not responded as we went to press.Saturday 11 Aug 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It goes without saying that as a Conservative councillor I don’t support the break-up of the UK, and those Craigentinny/Duddingston voters who gave me their first preference at last year’s election knew exactly what they were endorsing. Similarly, those who endorsed SNP candidates knew they were advancing the cause of independence.            At least that’s the way it’s supposed to work, but that assumption has been challenged this week by the decision of my former Conservative group colleague Ashley Graczyk to embrace Nationalism in so doing she has turned her back on the 1,600 people in Sighthill/Gorgie who gave their first preference to a candidate whose campaign literature said “We don’t want a second referendum” above a picture of her with Ruth Davidson.            Across the city, those people who opposed independence but didn’t support the Conservatives had the choice of voting for the Labour or Lib Dem candidates, but they voted for the candidate they thought best placed to oppose the SNP and as a result the Conservatives won the highest number of first preferences.Although it was a council election, there was no doubt the national picture was at the forefront of voters’ minds, while local concerns for people likely to vote Tory centred on initiatives closely associated with the Labour-SNP administration like the tram project and the blanket 20mph speed limit. First-time candidates like Ashley and I should have been under no illusion people would be voting for the party, not individuals.READ MORE: Ashley Graczyk: Why I quit as Tory councillor and now back independenceThe basis of the system relies on the candidates knowing exactly what they are representing. What they can’t do is within a matter of months say it’s all been a big mistake, that they didn’t really understand what they were representing, but then hang on to the seat and the allowance.  Councillor Graczyk hasn’t quite been able to make the full leap to membership of the SNP, and although her conversion to Nationalism hasn’t quite been Damascean, as recently as April she was posting pictures of herself on social media with a Union Flag.            Three SNP Edinburgh councillors have also left their parties, one following allegations of misconduct and the other two because of in-fighting, and while I still believe all three should have resigned, none have renounced the banner of independence under which they were elected. Ashley was elected as a representative of the Scottish Conservative \u0026amp Unionist party by people who believed in the Union and change in the council. She no longer represents us and the only way to find out if the views of those electors of Sighthill/Gorgie who backed her have altered is to ask them. If she really believes in representative democracy she should resign and fight a by-election.Bojo the publicity seeker strikes againSomeone whose loyalty to the Conservative cause has never been in any doubt is Eastwood MSP Jackson Carlaw, fighting campaign after campaign throughout the years when the Scottish party was at its lowest ebb.              For him, whatever may be going on behind the scenes public unity is an absolute, so I can only guess at how angry he was to use social media to condemn Boris Johnson over his Daily  burka column. “Just to be clear this is not a debate about the prevalence of the burka”, he tweeted. “It is about the casual, typically sensationalist and gratuitously offensive rhetoric deployed by Boris Johnson. It has caused real offence to many of my constituents. Bluntly, I’m fed up with him. Enough.”He was on relatively safe ground, given both Theresa May and Ruth Davidson had called on Johnson to apologise, and he now faces a formal party investigation. The problem was not the point of the article, which argued against a ban “because it is inevitably construed – rightly or wrongly – as being intended to make some point about Islam”, but his description of Muslim women looking like letter boxes or bank robbers. His critics would doubtless agree with the conclusion that “if you go for a total ban, you play into the hands of those who want to politicise and dramatise the so-called clash of civilisations”. Indeed, Ruth Davidson’s comparison with banning crucifixes is echoed in the article, pointing out that prohibition of veils would “risk a general crackdown on any public symbols of religious affiliation.”READ MORE: Brian Wilson: Boris the Cad pales in Lord Carrington’s noble shadowHaving duly fanned the flames of grievance, he predicted “you risk turning people into martyrs”, but Johnson is no martyr. Quite the opposite. Having made what was for him a low-key resignation speech and Westminster now becalmed in recess, he has successfully grabbed the headlines without actually calling for anything, and what might otherwise have been a 24-hour story could go on for days.            The greater the outrage, the greater the publicity which in turn feeds the outrage and mounts pressure on an increasingly compromised inquiry. The party is hanged if it doesn’t punish him and hanged if it does, while Johnson carries on regardless. If it had been a genuine misjudgement in which his eagerness to entertain went too far, then it would have simple to issue an immediate retraction. He didn’t.Maybe he will issue an “if I’ve caused offence” apology today, just in time to catch the Sunday papers and political shows in sleepy August, or maybe we all have to wait until the next instalment in Monday’s . But he’ll have had a week’s worth of publicity, appealed to a sizeable chunk of the electorate who won’t even have read the article, and been paid about £5,000 for the piece into the bargain. Just a couple of stinging similes and bingo, everyone is talking about old Bojo again. Shameless isn’t in it.No US trip for council deputationAnother withdrawal up at Edinburgh City Chambers, not a councillor, but the offer from the council’s IT supplier CGI to fly a group of five officials and councillors to the US and Canada to demonstrate how well they operate after mounting complaints about their performance here. Why the change of heart? Surely it can’t be because an anonymous councillor snitched to the Evening News? Or perhaps CGI realised a clean bill of health from the delegation could lead to accusations, however unfounded, of buying off criticism while the opposite would mean the company had met the cost of a kicking.No hold-ups on affordable housing\u2028Getting on with the day job... After the Prime Minister and First Minister formally signed off the £1.3bn Edinburgh Region City Deal this week, attention now switches to delivery. So much has been promised about the positive impact the investment will have that public expectation needs careful management, but there should be no hold-up with Edinburgh’s affordable house-building programme now the council has ownership of large tracts of land in Granton and approved the management process to create 4,000 new homes."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4780918.1533923697!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment house of fraser s fate now in mike ashley s hands","story":"        Market forces swept away House of Fraser, a giant of the high street, but Mike Ashley\u0026#8217s controversial Sport Direct empire will now try to put it back on its feet.                House of Fraser has a special place in the hearts of many Scots. It’s where your mum might have taken you shopping on that first big trip to the city centre as a child or the place where you bought your first party dress. It’s not just a shop, it’s part of many people’s lives.            But, as Woolworths discovered, nostalgia doesn’t count for much in terms of hard currency. Market forces are a powerful thing businesses that fail to swim with the tide are soon overcome and the currents have been shifting dramatically in recent years.            READ MORE: House of Fraser: Mike Ashley ‘to keep as many stores open as possible’While rival department store John Lewis moved quickly to create an effective online business, House of Fraser appears to have dawdled, only belatedly realising the extent of the transformation in buying habits.In addition, its 59 department stores contained hundreds of concessions, meaning that its own brand products – which could have been House of Fraser’s “unique selling point” – were overshadowed and overlooked. If ever a high street shop needed a strong reason to persuade people to actually visit the store, it is now. Next month, John Lewis plans to trial having personal stylists in-store and holding evening classes for precisely this reason.  A failure to recognise the need to innovate proved House of Fraser’s downfall, so one thing is certain after Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct bought it out of administration – change is coming. Ashley has talked about turning the chain into the “Harrods of the high street”, an ambitious plan that may test the public’s appetite for luxury. But experts also speculated that some stores could be turned into restaurants, bars, hotels and offices or be divided up into smaller shops.            Staff are likely to be nervous, even if their jobs are saved. In 2016, the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee said it had found evidence of “extremely disturbing” working practices at Sports Direct with staff penalised for taking a break to drink water or being ill and it also reported claims that workers were offered permanent contracts in exchange for sex.However, just as House of Fraser swallowed up stores like Arnotts, Binns and Jenners, Ashley’s business empire has now absorbed it. His task will be to leave the 1900s behind and find a 21st century business model.READ MORE: House of Fraser falls into administration"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4782350.1533933120!/image/image.jpg","title":"employers don t bother finding british staff says iain duncan smith","story":"        Employers \u0026#8220have not even bothered to look\u0026#8221 at British workers for vacancies currently filled by EU workers, Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith has said.                Speaking on the BBC yesterday, the former work and pensions secretary blamed employers for not hiring British workers and dismissed business chiefs’ call for immigration targets to be scrapped after Brexit.            Instead, he said a system of work permits should be extended to all foreign workers wanting to come to the UK.            “A lot of employers simply have not even bothered to try and find UK people to work,” he said.“I think the best thing to do is work with what we have got and make it work for everyone around the world,” he said. “You basically extend the work permit process across the EU and the rest of the world. People can come here for work but they need to have work to come to and that work needs to have been agreed and accepted that there isn’t a person in the UK that could do that work and has the skills to do that work.”Mr Duncan Smith, the founder of the troubled universal credit benefits scheme currently being rolled out, went on to claim the current welfare system was distorting the employment market.He said: “What’s happened is access to benefits, including child benefits even if you don’t have your children with you, has distorted the whole system around them being able to offer much cheaper wages and have them completely topped up.“In the last year figures were available, and this is important, more than £4.1 billion was spent on people from the EU who have come over here getting tax credits, child benefits, housing benefits. That’s one of the great pull factors.            “Leaving the EU, we should not be offering for people to come over here just looking for work and to claim benefits.“We need a living wage that does not require people to come over here and claim benefits to top up.”But the CBI, representing business leaders across the UK, has called for politicians to recognise the value of immigration to the UK economy, which they said should include scrapping immigration targets after Brexit.Businesses need a new immigration policy, avoiding visas for EU citizens and putting migration on the table for trade talks, according to the CBI’s new report Open And Controlled - A New Approach To Migration.            Evidence from 129,000 firms across 18 industry sectors in the report showed the importance of migration at all skill levels, said CBI deputy director-general Josh Hardie."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we are underdogs in milne cup clash says shetland manager main ","story":"Shetland football team\u0026#8217s coaches Kevin Main (on left) and Robert Geddes at a training session at the Gilbertson Park last Wednesday. Photo: Kevin Jones\nThe Shetland men’s football and women’s hockey teams go head to head with their Orkney opponents in tomorrow’s inter-county matches.\nBoth games are at Pickaquoy in Kirkwall, with the hockey at noon and the football following at 2pm.\nA celebratory dinner will take place in the evening to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup football encounter, and a veterans’ game is due to be played on Sunday morning.\nAs far as the main football match is concerned, Shetland manager Kevin Main is optimistic that his side can get a good result and keep hold of the trophy which they regained with a 2-0 win in Lerwick last year.\nHe said: “I feel it’s very important to be confident going in to any type of sporting arena. I think if there’s any doubt in any competitor’s mind, that will show up a weakness.\n“So it’s important our guys feel confident and from the experience of Shetland inter-county matches before – of which me and [assistant manager] Robert [Geddes] have had a couple – we know that this team is capable of meeting the standard required to win.”\nHowever, Main is under no illusion about the scale of the challenge facing his side.\nHe said: “Orkney at this moment in time in my mind are clear favourites [due to] their home record over the last year, albeit in a different format – the North Caledonian competition.\n“In addition, two years ago we went with great confidence and unfortunately came away with a defeat so we know they are extremely strong and difficult on their home park.”\n *Eighteen players will be travelling but only 16 can be selected for the match.\nMeanwhile, hopes are high that the Shetland women’s hockey team can improve on their recent record against Orkney.\nThis year’s game will see Orkney attempt to record a 14th straight victory.\nShetland’s last success came via a penalty shoot-out after a 2-2 draw in 2003, but joint coaches Derek and Brenda Leask believe the team is close to finally turning the corner.\nDerek Leask said: “The team is well prepared and have been focusing on strength and speed work with weekly Sunday morning training sessions at the Factory Gym at Whiteness.\n“Dhanni Moar and his coach Bryan Pearson, devised a 12-week training programme to have the lasses in peak condition. The squad demonstrated great commitment in tuning up in large numbers to every session. The hockey team really appreciated Dhanni and Bryan giving up their time to help them perform to their best in this fixture.\n“It’s been a long time since Shetland won the cup in Orkney [1982] but despite the reds’ recent success the team is confident of pushing them all the way this year.\n“We’re really looking forward to putting on a competitive display and showing that there is a high standard of hockey in Shetland too.”\nHockey squad: Megan Nicholson (Spurs), Francesca MacColl (Delting) Janetta Williamson (Delting), Rhiannon Inkster (Spurs), Megan Hibbert (Delting) Vicky Wiseman (Burra), Nicola Balfour (Delting), Kristen Jeromson (Burra), Emma Michael (Spurs), Aimee Keith (Zetland), Kayleigh Irvine (Zetland), Maggie Kay (Whalsay), Rhea Nicolson (Burra), Victoria Duthie (Whalsay), Cara Leask (Delting), Kristan Robertson (Burra), Stacey Laurenson (Burra) and Sarah Williamson (Burra).\n• Follow The Shetland Times\u0026#8217 website and Facebook page this weekend for scores and updates\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nSaturday 11 Aug 2018 10:39 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116804.jpg","title":"Beauty spot gets the all clear from SEPA","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nBadenoch and Strathspey\u0027s most popular bathing spot has been given the all-clear from blue-green algae which can make humans very ill and potentially be fatal to dogs.\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Team attended at Loch Morlich at Glenmore on Tuesday following reports of an outbreak at the beauty spot which is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people every year.\nSigns had been erected at key locations around the loch warning visitors of the potential presence of the algae.\nIt is understood that a concerned local vet raised the possibility of the algae being present after a dog took ill showing symptoms of having been in contact with blue algae following a visit to the beauty spot.\nA SEPA spokeswoman said: \"A member of our team went to Loch Morlich on Tuesday to take a sample of the algae and none could be found.

The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one.

We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties.

Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/david-mundell.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

Tourism makes a critical contribution to the local economy, and indeed the wider Scottish economy, and indirectly enables people to live, work and raise a family on the island.\n“As such, we write to categorically assert that Skye and Raasay is well and truly open for business.”\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27422  ","story":"Mary Lou McDonald speaking after meeting with Theresa May.\n Michael McMonagle\n\nIt is now clear that the British Prime Minister has come here to pick a fight with the Ireland to pick a fight with the European Union. - Mary Lou McDonald\nBritish Prime Minster Theresa May came to the north \"to pick a fight\" with Ireland and the EU, Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou McDonald, said today. \nThe Sinn Féin President met Theresa May in Belfast this morning alongside Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O\u0027Neill and Conor Murphy. \nThe Tory leader is in the north on a two-day visit to discuss Brexit and other issues.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

They know the Cadet movement is as much committed to building confidence and friendships as it is to building skills.\n\n“Our Banbridge Cadets embraced every opportunity brought to them at this year’s Summer Camp, held at Strensall, near York, with great good humour and seemingly boundless energy. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Now, following a Summer packed with challenge and achievement, they’ll be turning their attention to their annual new membership campaign and I am sure they will all become highly persuasive recruiters as they invite local teenagers to come along and see what Cadet life has to offer.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more about what membership of the Army, Sea or Air Cadets can offer you or your children, contact 0800 730 730 or visit www.reservesandcadetsni.org.uk.

To cater for the individual needs of the every member of the community, the team can also provide guidance on the bank’s Post Office service, its telephone banking system and its Bank on Wheels.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThroughout the year Richard will be organising a series of events open to the public as well as delivering presentations for schools and community organisations about the importance of staying safe and secure when banking, good practice for identifying fraud and scams, using the Ulster Bank Anytime Banking app and transitioning from traditional to digital banking services.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nCommunity Banker Richard Gill explained: “I’m really looking forward to engaging with people right across Co. Down and being an active part of this community.\n\n“Being financially fit, aware of how to keep your money safe and secure, and feeling confident in using digital technologies are important skills, and the events I’m planning to run will reflect that.”\n\nRichard will host regular drop-in clinics in Rathfriland and Dromore and on call to help customers Monday to Friday, between 9am and 5pm.

At this point in the Brexit negotiations there is very little we could put past this government who seem prepared to sign up to almost anything in the name of Brexit, and oblivious to the tension these proposals create.

Hayley was forced to medically retire before her 40th birthday.\n\n\"Everything was put down to post-natal depression,\" she said. \n\n\"Within a year I was suicidal and eventually the diagnosis changed to chronic depression.\n\n\"I did everything I could to try and get better but nothing worked.\n\n\"How many others are there like me?\"\n\nHayley complained of being exhausted all the time and eventually began falling asleep behind the wheel of her car.\n\n\"I would just nod off and have these really vivid dreams and when I woke up I was in the car,\" she recalled.\n\n\"I would arrive places and have no memory of how I got there - it was terrifying.\" \n\nHayley also became extremely paranoid which took its toll in work and at home.\n\n\"I second guessed everything because I believed everyone was out to get me,\" she said.\n\n\"I even thought I was being bullied in work.\n\n\"My family life suffered too and my children, especially the younger two, have certainly not had the best of me.\" \n\nBy 2010, as her health continued to deteriorate, Hayley began losing confidence in her ability to do her job and took an entire year off.\n\n\"I got to the point where I felt it was safer for everyone if I just wasn\u0027t there,\" she said.\n\nThe former clerk, who had given birth twice during her five years of study, transferred from ICU and began district nursing closer to home.\n\nHowever her symptoms worsened and she became overwhelmed by daytime sleepiness. \n\n\"Driving even short distances became a serious problem,\" she said.\n\n\"I would need to pull over two miles into the journey and nap for 20 minutes. \n\n\"I was losing things that eventually turned up in the freezer, including bank cards - it wasn\u0027t normal.\" \n\nThe distraught medic, who was struggling to breathe in her sleep, was left devastated when the results of overnight respiratory tests in 2014 failed to shed any light on the cause of her misery.\n\n\"I cried when they said everything was fine because I knew it wasn\u0027t and so did my husband,\" she said. \n\nIt was then that a consultant began to probe her about her \"crazy\" dream activity. \n\n\"I talked about my night terrors and how vivid they are. \n\n\"I told him about the black hand that strangles me in my sleep,\" she said.\n\n\"The hand, it\u0027s wrapped in a black leather glove, grabs my throat and squeezes until I can\u0027t breathe anymore.\"\n\nThe consultant recommended testing for narcolepsy and Hayley made arrangements to see a specialist in England.\n\nIt was then that she was diagnosed with the chronic sleep disorder.\n\nBut it was only after reading the harrowing story of a 23-year-old nursery assistant in England that Hayley realised there could be a link between the vaccine and the incurable sleep condition.\n\n\"I read the heartbreaking story about Katie Clack and how she struggled to deal with the terrible effects of narcolepsy,\" she explained.\n\n\"She ended up taking her own life but detailed her experience of trying to deal with the catastrophic side effects of the vaccine in a suicide note and I realised her symptoms were my symptoms.\" \n\nShe contacted the Southern Health and Social Care Trust which confirmed the vaccine she was given in 2009 contained Pandemrix. \n\n\"I cried and then I became very angry,\" she recalled. \n\n\"I try so hard not to be bitter, but it\u0027s difficult because I have lost everything. \n\n\"I\u0027m not the person I want to be.\"\n\nHayley said the toughest part of her arduous journey has been trying to get the Department of Health to recognise the link between her life-shattering illness and the flu jab.\n\n\"It has been a nightmare, but my medical notes are crystal clear,\" she said.\n\n\"I was not ill before I was given this vaccine.\"\n\nThe now permanently disabled mum, who even requires supervision to have a bath, said she feels \"betrayed\" by the health service.\n\n\"It wasn\u0027t my decision to take it, I was told it was part of the job,\" she said.\n\n\"But what really galls me is that no one ever outlined the risks, which I believe were well known, and no one will take responsibility.\n\n\"I have been completely abandoned.\"\n\nHayley, who continues to fund her own travel to England twice a year to see a specialist, said that the absence of a devolved government has compounded her ordeal.\n\n\"I just want recognition, but honesty is a rare thing,\" she added. \n\n\"Many questions need to be answered but not much can be done without a government in place.\n\n\"I know I was a good nurse, but where is my NHS now? Where is my government?\"\n\nThe Southern Trust and Department of Health said they would not comment on individual cases.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"75m rooftop running track plan for old belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"call for intervention in limavady to ease tensions after sectarian incidents","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It is also disappointing that the PSNI, who were on the scene, took no measures to stop them and that is something I raised with the police in today’s meeting,\" Ms Archibald said.\n\n“As we face into the weekend, particularly with the Apprentice Boys parade taking place, there is a responsibility on all political, civic and community leaders to do all they can to help reduce the tensions that exist.\n\n“The community in Limavady are growing increasingly concerned at the damage that is being done to community relations so I would again appeal to all those in positions of influence to stand together in combating this negative agenda.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself.

Previously, Gerry Adams has called the report \u0027common sense\u0027,\" the Strangford MLA said.\n\n\"Behind some of the claims that \u0027everyone’s a winner\u0027 in this united-Ireland however there lies a reliance on supposition and wishful thinking to build a case.\n\n\"Looking at just some of the issues included in the report’s ‘Ten Point Plan’ sheds some light on the strength of the case put forward.\n\n\"The report assumes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA report has claimed Northern Ireland could be financially better off in a united Ireland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinued UK government subvention to Northern Ireland for approximately thirty years.\n\nAn immediate £10billion contribution to infrastructure by the UK government.\n\nThe UK government will continue to fund pension costs.\"\n\nMr Hamilton said that reunification would cost thousands of jobs in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"Interestingly, the report does not dwell too long on its view that 50,000 public sector workers in Northern Ireland would have to be made redundant. However even in this area it expects the United Kingdom Exchequer to bear all the costs,\" he said.\n\n\"All these highlight the lack of substance behind many of those who claim a united-Ireland is some kind of inevitability. We cannot be complacent however and must continue putting forward a positive case for the Union.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland chippies take carryouts to new heights","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Mallon of the Dolphin Takeaway in Dungannon will undertake The Kilimanjaro Chippy Challenge, serving up delights for hungry climbers at 15,255ft.\n\nArriving in Tanzania on September 1, the duo will climb the tallest free-standing mountain in the world, before setting up the highest pop-up fish and chip shop at the Barafu Camp.\n\nThey\u0027re aiming to raise much-needed funds for the Fishermen\u0027s Mission charity as a thank you to the trawler crews who keep their businesses supplied with the sea\u0027s bounty. \n\nAlan said he was proud to support the \"worthy\" charity, which helps those working in the fishing trade, the most dangerous occupation in the UK.\n\nHe said: \"Malachy and I have seen first-hand the great work the Fishermen\u0027s Mission carries out to support the fishermen who put their lives on the line to supply us with product. \n\n\"So I suppose the idea was born out of the need to raise awareness and much-needed funds for them. \n\n\"Malachy suggested the Kilimanjaro idea to me last year at the National Federation of Fish Friers Annual Ball and I instantly agreed to take up the challenge for this worthy cause. \n\n\"All of the donations we can get will make such a difference to those facing hardship.\"\n\nThe Kilimanjaro Chippy Challenge is the latest charity effort for Malachy, after he raised £9,000 by cycling 1,500 miles around the UK, visiting the winners of the Fish and Chip awards 2017.\n\nThe pair will climb for eight consecutive days, before cooking fish and chips and a few other favourites for the local orphanage before their record attempt. \n\nA percentage of the funds raised will be donated to the Fortune Kids and Education Foundation Orphanage Centre, which was opened in February 2016 and cares for children under five. \n\nWith the trip to Africa looming next month, Alan said they had stepped up their preparations.\n\n\"Although I live right in the heart of the Mournes, I had no previous climbing experience, but that has changed since last October,\" he said.\n\n\"I have been out trekking the mountains at least once a week for the last 10 months and this last month we have upped our training, sometimes covering five peaks and a distance of 25km a day.\"\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37202535.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/5_The_annual_Appren.jpg","title":"northern ireland

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"temporary morgues planned for popes visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"final day of trading for several marks spencer stores","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The car is now a place to eat lunch, catch up on urgent work or even grab a sneaky nap.\n\n“But it seems many motorists simply don’t have time to declutter and clean.

Since he is an Irish national, he could now be deported. Charges are very serious. All this because I’m told his buddies bet him $80..\n— Hazel Mae (@thehazelmae) \nAugust 5, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nRan into friends of the streaker outside of Safeco. They showed us his clothes.

The area has been refurbished with a modern new monochrome-themed interior complete with beautiful Amelia Earhart artwork as a tribute to the famous first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. As well as comfortable new seating and tables, free internet access and free view television entertainment, access to complimentary refreshments and a serene view of the beautiful hills of Donegal.\n\nAirport Manager, Charlene Shongo, expressed her delight at the re-opening event: “We are absolutely thrilled that the Amelia Earhart Lounge has been restored, providing an additional space for our passengers to relax. The lounge is ideal for business and leisure customers seeking a quiet space and a little luxury in advance of their flight.\n\n“Access to the lounge is just £10pp and can be booked online on our website and includes complimentary tea/coffee and soft drink, newspapers and magazines and much, much more to enhance the overall airport experience.

He has also managed ‘pacers’ since the 2013 Walled City Marathon 2013 (organised to coincide with ‘City of Culture’ year and the first marathon held in Derry for almost 30 years).\n\n“On race day I will be managing a team of 12 ‘pacers’ said Paddy. “Indeed, our pacing team are experienced runners tasked with completing the course in a specific time – at 15-minute intervals between 1hr 30 and 2hrs 30 for this year’s Waterside Half Marathon.\n\n“Holding an even or steady pace throughout a race – as well as combating early adrenaline-fuelled enthusiasm by runners for a fast start – is just one part of the job” says Paddy.\n\n“The pacers are also personal motivators during the race itself. They will help runners along with shouts of encouragement and regular progress updates – and really can make the difference between a disappointing finish to a race and a resounding success.\n\n“Most marathons and half marathons have pacers nowadays” said Paddy. “And they are proving very popular! The Council and organisers of this year’s half marathon are keen to do what they can to improve the experience for runners. Indeed, last year’s participants couldn’t praise the pacers enough for the assistance they provided in helping them to achieve their personal bests (PBs).\n\n“The runners also paid tribute to ‘the craic’ they had with the pacers and for adding so much to the camaraderie of the race itself.”\n\nPaddy says that the pacers in this year’s Waterside Half Marathon will help people to run as evenly as possible or ‘hold an even mile pace’ as he calls it. “If your goal is to finish this year’s half marathon in 2 hours, running with a 2-hour pacer will help you to maintain an average pace of 9 minutes 9 seconds per mile” he said.\n\n“I can’t stress enough how important it is to have pacers at a race. We’re therefore looking forward again this year to help runners get their speed right.\n\n“Following a pacer is also one less thing to worry about – and can really take the pressure off a runner” Paddy says. “On race day there is a lot to think about – from getting there on time to managing hydration or fuel intake during the race. Therefore, runners have enough to be thinking about without also worrying about their pace!”\n\n“Following a pacer will allow you to get your head down, focus on the running and be guided to the finish line in your target time” said Paddy.\n\n“Pacing yourself sensibly during the course of the race – especially amid the excitement and adrenaline of the start – is key to ensuring that it is less of a struggle, particularly for a first-time or beginner” he said. “That’s not to say that it won’t still be a physical challenge – it will – but pacing yourself will help prevent people from struggling or having to stop.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027241829\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\n“The pacers and the group of runners following the pacer will also offer motivation – giving you something to cling on to or spur you on if you’re struggling to keep up – as they are all in the same boat and will be trying to achieve the same goal. This creates a camaraderie that just can’t be matched by running on your own” Paddy said.\n\n“People also ask ‘How do I pick the right half marathon pacer?’ Choosing which pacer to follow will depend a lot on your training. I would therefore recommend you set a realistic target time, particularly if this is your first half marathon.\n\n“I’d also advise beginners to err on the side of caution. If you want to have a positive experience, don’t set a goal that’s over-stretching yourself. Set a target time that’s challenging but achievable” he said.\n\n\nMeet the pacers\n\n\nDuring this year’s Waterside Half Marathon Paddy will manage 12 pacers in total – 3 pacers for 1hr 30 (Jason Scott, Rodney Agnew and Andy Gray), 2 for 1hr 45 (Darren Madden and Gary Moore), 3 for 2hrs (Gregory O’Brien, Shaun McLaughlin and Paddy McLaughlin), 2 for 2hrs 15 (Stuart Campbell and Andrea Cairns) and 2 for 2hrs 30 (Helena Doran and Claire Martin).\n\nPaddy explains the reason that there are 3 pacers (instead of two) for the 1hr 30 and 2hr finish times is because they’re the most popular in terms of runners who are hoping to achieve a target or beat their personal best (PB).\n\n“The 1hr 30 or ‘90-minute’ finish time is a big hurdle that a lot of runners want to get over.” he said. “The same can also be said of other runners who want to break the 2hr mark.\n\n“We therefore have 3 pacers running in 1hr 30 and 2hr finish times. During the course of the race one of the pacers may drop back a little from the pack to spur on runners who are struggling. Of the two who are left – particularly when it comes to the final stages of the race – one may decide to guide a group of runners to the finish line who are definitely feeling ok and really want to go ‘flat out’ to beat their PB – while the last / remaining pacer will stay with the original group of runners” said Paddy.\n\n“We really want to see as many runners as possible achieve their goals – and it is so rewarding to see them at the finish line having done just that” he said.\n\n“So if you\u0027re planning to take part in this year’s Waterside Half Marathon, I would urge you to join up with one of the pacers before the race begins on Sunday 2 September. Indeed, our team of pacers will be identified by ‘pacer vests’ and coloured balloons corresponding with the finish times. Runners who are taking part in the half marathon will also be encouraged to join the pacers via announcements at the start line on the morning of the race.” \n\nPaddy concluded: “You really will be great hands – and the entire pacing team is hoping to help even more runners this year achieve those all-important PBs!”\n\nEntries to the race close at midnight on Monday 13th August 2018 and you can register online now at \nwww.derrystrabane/whm\n - where you will also find further information on this year’s Waterside Half Marathon.\n\n\nPictured above: Last year\u0027s pacers in action preparing for the Waterside Half Marathon.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.countytimes.co.uk//resources/images/8123475.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"newtown first look for residents at 32m new","story":"\nAt the Mid Wales Housing Association preview event at Cwrt Cei Coed, Newtown, ar\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gte Ffion Jones, aged \u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtfive, and three-year-old Trystan Jones and Summer Jones, nine.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143330/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nFirst look for residents at £3.2m new homes development in Newtown\n\nMid Wales Housing Association Preview Event at Cwrt Cei Coed, Newtown last Wedne\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtsday July 11, 2018.p\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtictured from left, Nathan Pritchard, John Bowen, Dylan Pritchard, Lisa Davies, Madison Pritchard and Keira Davies.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143332/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nFirst look for residents at £3.2m new homes development in Newtown\n\nMid Wales Housing Association Preview Event at Cwrt Cei Coed, Newtown last Wedne\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtsday July 11, 2018.p\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtictured from left, Ffion Jones (5) and Trystan Jones (3) and Summer Jones (9)\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143333/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                \n                            \n\n                            \nSkip to next image \u0026raquo\n                        \n                                            \n"},{"url":null,"title":"presteigne carnival 2018 sunshine and live music added to the fun at","story":"\nPIC 10: THE Primary School’s Royal Wedding float in all its glory during the P\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtresteigne Carnival d\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtay parade.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143390/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nPictures: Sunshine and live music added to the fun at Presteigne Carnival\n\nPIC 1: CARNIVAL Queen Sophie Preece after her crowning with attendants Phoebe Ka\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gttsaitis, Menna Baynh\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtam, Mair Thomas and Kameron Traylor.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143392/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nPictures: Sunshine and live music added to the fun at Presteigne Carnival\n\nPIC 2: A BIG turnout by the Celtic Dragons Motorbike Club saw them joining the p\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtarade and staging a \u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtstatic display on the Carnival Field before going on to present The Woodchoppers Ball at their headquarters The Woodchoppers Arms in Knighton R\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143393/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nPictures: Sunshine and live music added to the fun at Presteigne Carnival\n\nPIC 3: PUPILS of Presteigne Primary School.
