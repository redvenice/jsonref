Boris Johnson has become Prime Minister without any popular mandate. He has no right to drive our country off a cliff and into the arms of Donald Trump with his no-deal fixation.\u0027The plan I set out this week is the simplest and most democratic way to stop no-deal. We have to seize the opportunity before it\u0027s too late, so the people, rather than an unelected Prime Minister, can decide our country\u0027s future.\u0027A spokesman for the Speaker said: \u0027Mr Speaker has always operated an open-door policy, and is happy to meet MPs from across the House representing a wide range of views. The basis on which you suggest Mr Speaker is meeting people is totally wrong, and the meetings you allege took place did not.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Pictured Moment Harry Meghan took private jet flight South France","story":"Share this articleMake like Meghan in a straw hat by Maison MichelBuy a similar version at NET-A-PORTERThe Duchess of Sussex has definitely got a head for hats, and you might recall her carrying this chic white straw style by Maison Michel at Wimbledon last year.

Sales soared there after President Xi Jinping was pictured drinking a pint of the brew with then prime minister David Cameron during a state visit in 2015.The cash bid, which Greene King’s directors have advised shareholders to accept, values the company at £2.7bn, or £4.6bn including the debt that CKA will be taking on.CKA, a property business based in Hong Kong but incorporated in the Cayman Islands, said its bid was founded on its confidence in Britain’s enduring love of pubs.The number of pubs has been in long-term decline but the pace at which their numbers are declining has slowed in 2019.Greene King traces its history back to 1799, when it was founded in the sleepy Suffolk town of Bury-St-Edmunds by 19-year-old Benjamin Greene.By contrast, CKA is part of a vast empire of global business interests headed by Li Ka-shing, who is estimated to be worth $29.4bn, making him the world’s 30th richest man.CKA focuses on property and investments, owning a host of prestigious addresses and stakes in utility companies.Its properties include 5 Broadgate, the UK headquarters of Swiss bank UBS, the Chelsea Waterfront development and luxury London apartment blocks Belgravia Place and Royal Gate Kensington.“CKA’s strategy is to look for businesses with stable and resilient characteristics and strong cash flow generating capabilities,” said George Magnus, who chairs the takeover vehicle the Hong Kong firm is using to complete the deal.“The UK pub and brewing sector shares these characteristics and we believe that this sector will continue to be an important part of British culture in the long run.”Nick Mackenzie, chief executive of Greene King, said: “Greene King has a well-invested estate in prime locations, leading brands, a rich history and a talented team of 38,000 people serving millions of customers across the country every week.”Nik Antona, national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale said the sale of Greene King was “very concerning for our beer scene”.He added: “We hope that Greene King will continue its operations as normal without any disappointing changes. We will be calling on the new owners to retain the current pub portfolio to safeguard thousands of pubs and jobs across the country.”British brewers have proved particularly attractive for foreign buyers, who have pounced on traditional family operations such as Greene King, as well as the newer breed of so-called “craft” breweries.Fuller, Smith \u0026amp Turner accepted a £250m offer for its entire drinks business from the Japanese beer group Asahi, including its flagship London Pride ale, earlier this year.The company, which had three relatives of the Victorian brewing barons John Fuller, Henry Smith and John Turner on its board at the time of the deal, said it had taken the decision to quit beer after 174 years to concentrate on running pubs and hotels.So-called “craft” brewers have also proved attractive to foreign buyers, particularly multinational drinks companies that have swooped on brands such as Camden Town, Beavertown and Meantime, capitalising on the growing popularity of smaller breweries.The trend has sparked concern within the beer industry that big companies are buying out independent competition, compromising the integrity of the so-called “craft revolution”.SAB Miller kicked off the trend in 2015 by buying London brewer Meantime for £120m . The brand later had to be sold to Asahi as a condition of SAB’s “Megabrew” takeover by AB InBev, which had bought north London brewer Camden Town for £85m in 2015.In 2017, Carlsberg snapped up London Fields Brewery, which was put up for sale after its founder was charged with tax fraud.Dutch multinational brewer Heineken paid £40m for a minority stake in fast-growing Tottenham brewery Beavertown last year.More recently, Australia’s Lion bought highly-rated Huddersfield-based brewer Magic Rock, a year after buying Bermondsey-based Fourpure, while Molson Coors bought Hop Stuff.Other beers clothed in craft branding, but owned by global firms, include Goose Island, Blue Point, Hop House 13, Blue Moon, Sharp’s Doom Bar and Lagunitas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4448227c5127c48918ec993a2cfc3e1b2e709ef1/0_90_2813_1688/master/2813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e56e5b7d7a4504a705e1ecf9c3f5caf3","title":"is us capitalism really abandoning the greed is good mantra","story":"The US roundtablers’ pledge is woolly. So it’s baby steps for now to stop Capitol Hill forcing more drastic changesMilton Friedman will be spinning in his grave at the heresy perpetrated by the US Business Roundtable. For the thick end of five decades US capitalism has been run along Friedmanite lines – namely that businesses are there to make money for their shareholders. No charitable giving, no ersity awareness. No green audits. Just making money. Period.Now some of the highest paid on the planet have appeared to ditch the idea of shareholder primacy. Sure, they say, shareholders matter but so do a range of other stakeholders: customers, employees, suppliers and communities. Workers must be treated with dignity and respect. Businesses will be run sustainably in order to protect the environment.If it’s for real, this represents quite a sea change. Friedman’s essay for the New York Times in 1970 was hugely influential and has governed boardroom behaviour ever since. The whole “greed is good” philosophy that flowered in the 1980s was based on the economist’s idea that the sole task of executives was to enrich shareholders provided they played by the rules.But Friedman also said that playing by the rules meant more than obeying the law: it meant conforming to ethical custom. And in recent years there has been a shift in what the public considers to be right and wrong. The fact that CEOs have seen their pay rocket while average wages have stagnated is part of the story, but so too is the way in which profit-maximising companies have hollowed out communities by moving production offshore.Yet capitalism adapts to changing circumstances. It can survive and thrive where regulations are lax, as they are in the US. And it can flourish where regulations are tighter, as they are in Scandinavia. That’s why it has survived for so long and seen off previous challenges. And those presiding over US boardrooms can sense that politicians such as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have struck a chord with their calls for root-and-branch reform of business practices.There are those who will wonder just how genuine the move to stakeholder capitalism actually is, and they are right to be suspicious. The one-page statement is pretty woolly: there is, for example, talk of paying workers fairly but no commitment to pay them more. Better, the roundtablers might think, to take baby steps towards a more inclusive approach now than have a bunch of legislators on Capitol Hill force them into more drastic changes.The meeting between Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel later this week is not likely to be especially fruitful but at least they will have something in common: both are presiding over shrinking economies.If anything, the short-term problems facing Germany are even greater than those affecting the UK. Europe’s biggest economy shrank in the second quarter of 2019 and, according to the country’s central bank, is on course to do so again in the third. Two consecutive quarters of falling output constitute a recession. The Bundesbank says Brexit and the slowdown in exports caused by global trade tensions are two big contributory factors to the slowdown.It’s a sign of how bad things are that the German finance minister, Olaf Scholz, has pledged that €55bn (£50bn) could be spent to boost growth if it proves necessary. But there’s one thing saying the purse strings could be loosened and them actually being loosened. And Germany has not secured the reputation of being the most fiscally conservative country in Europe for nothing.In the meantime Johnson will be hoping that the travails of the German economy will make Merkel more willing to make Brexit compromises. No sign of them so far, though."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3ccc790446464c05dca69d6e7c3ae7e775e1883/0_18_1503_901/master/1503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26251b7c8292839d94c87b3e763ddd5b","title":"national grid chief gets 1m pay rise for strong performance","story":"Windfall payout for John Pettigrew revealed days after UK’s worst blackout in a decadeLess than two weeks after Britain’s biggest blackout in a decade National Grid has revealed that it handed its chief executive a £1m pay rise over the last financial year to reward his “strong performance.”.The company’s annual report, published on Monday, shows that John Pettigrew was paid £4.56m for the last financial year, up from £3.65m the year before, for delivering value to shareholders.The pay-day windfall was revealed as National Grid prepares to publish an interim report on the 9 August blackout which left almost a million homes without electricity, and hundreds of thousands of people stranded in rush-hour travel disruption.

He came to this country in 1959 and had his own butcher’s shop in Manchester. I was his apprentice. There were three of us – my older brother, me and my younger brother.I opened my business on 1 November 2001. My father was very proud parents like their children to follow in their footsteps. My dad had tremendous ability – I won’t bring myself to say I’m on the same level, but maybe I’m halfway there.It’s a family business now. My wife serves the customers, and my son has a takeaway next door I supply the meat to them. We work as a team. It’s a hard working life. I start at 7am preparing the meat for the counter, and we’re open 9am-9pm, seven days a week. I’m 51 and I’m still working away, but I’m making a living and I’m happy. When I retire, if I have the stamina, I’ll still do a few hours a day. I’ve always worked – I’m a working-class person.I love Manchester. I was born and bred here, and I would never go anywhere else. The Jilani name has been around for a long time – the mosques know us, the whole community knows us, and generations of people still come to buy halal meat from us.Manchester has always been a base for Asian people, from India and Pakistan. I don’t feel European at all I feel British, English. I’ve been to other countries in Europe, but England’s 10 times better.David Cameron made the wrong decision. I think it would have been better to stay in the EU for business reasons. I’m a small businessman – we’re all out to make a living. Whatever happens with Brexit, I hope the change is for the better.Benny Gränitz, 37, butcher in Chemnitz, GermanyMany people don’t want to pay extra for good-quality meat. But I am optimistic that is changing – it seems that fewer people are buying cut-price supermarket sausages. I like my job. We can influence the whole chain, from the farmer to the customer who eats our sausages.For me, being European has its advantages. It’s practical to be able to cross borders without issues. On the downside, there are lots of European rules and regulations that make my life difficult. Maybe we’d have to comply with similar rules even without the EU, but they are definitely a big factor, and they have forced some local butchers to close. We’ve had to invest a lot to meet their strict standards.I don’t foresee any big shift for our business after Brexit. A lot will depend on how Britain fares outside the EU. If things go well, maybe other countries will want to follow suit. If things go badly, I’m sure people will feel happy to stay.Twinning is a nice idea, but I didn’t know we were partnered with Manchester. The two cities are well suited they are both industrial places. We also have a Düsseldorf square in Chemnitz, named after our partner city in the former West Germany.Life in Chemnitz is quiet and pleasant. There’s not much going on. Sometimes it’s as if the streets have been emptied of people. Other places are livelier but I can’t imagine living anywhere else.Interview by Jess SmeePunam Krishan, 35, is a GP who lives in Glasgow with her husband and five-year-old sonI’m one of the very few GPs who still loves being a GP. People see us when they’re at a crossroads – with their health, wellbeing or personal situations. You get to be part of their big moments as well as their not-so-big moments.As a partner, I experienced stress and burnout. You work 12-hour days as a GP and then have to manage the business side, as well as juggling family life.It was encroaching on all my relationships, and I felt quite unhappy. I remember being on holiday in Turkey, ordering toilet roll for the health centre for my practice. I left my partnership in September 2017 and I’ve been a locum ever since.Although my heritage is Indian (my mum and dad are from Punjab) I was born and brought up in Glasgow. I’m very much part of two cultures. My mum used to take us to India every summer, and by week four I’d think: “I just want to go home.”I love being Glaswegian it’s such a multicultural, erse city. I didn’t appreciate it until I moved to London for a few years. In London you have pockets with, for example, a large Indian population or a Caribbean community. In Glasgow, the communities are a lot more integrated.Scotland didn’t want to leave the EU, so there is this sense of feeling hard done by, and the fact my son hasn’t had a choice in this saddens me. I want to keep him connected I’ll probably take him on more holidays to Europe after Brexit.I worry about what’s going to happen to my European friends and colleagues. If they leave, how will that affect our NHS, and our wider healthcare system? A lot of our machines and drugs come from Europe. If we don’t have a deal, how are we going to access these things?Although the idea of twinning towns predates the second world war, it was in its aftermath that the concept took hold as a way of promoting reconciliation and friendship between nations. Coventry, which suffered heavy bombing, was a pioneer. In 1942, women from the city sent a message of hope to the women of Stalingrad (now Volgograd), which had also been devastated. Two years later, the two cities agreed an official “bond of friendship”. Links with Kiel (1947) and Dresden (1956) followed.In the early 1970s, as the UK prepared to join the European Economic Community, the government offered funding to encourage twinning. “The idea was that new forms of trade would be more successful if British people were culturally competent in dealing with Europeans,” says Nick Clarke, associate professor of human geography at the University of Southampton. School exchanges and foreign language learning flourished.The 21st century, however, has seen some partnerships falter, with a number of UK towns “un-twinning” from their European counterparts. When Peter Davies became mayor of Doncaster in 2009 he scrapped its five town-twinning arrangements, as part of a series of cash-saving measures. “Only about a dozen people ever benefited from these trips,” he said. “I can see that it arose out of altruistic motives after the war, but it just became about junkets.” In 2011 the Tory-run town council in Bishop’s Stortford ended ties with Friedberg and Villiers-sur-Marne, after more than 46 years, blaming “lack of interest”. The Lib Dems argued it had more to do with Tory Euroscepticism.Antonio Barillà, 57, is a family doctor working in TurinI have been working as a family doctor in Turin and the wider Piedmont region for 26 years. Over the years the job has changed for the worse. There is a real lack of funding in the public sector. Bureaucracy slows us down. There are pharmaceutical and diagnostic rules that must be followed treatment protocols that are still printed on paper. If a worker takes a sick day, they still have to present their employer with a written affidavit from their family doctor. It is this sort of bureaucratic strain that causes burnout, and motivates Italian doctors to abandon the public sector.I don’t feel Turin is an important part of my identity. I was born in Reggio Calabria, in southern Italy, and came here for work. Hundreds of thousands of Italians moved from the south to Turin after the second world war. They left their cities and families to work here. Turin is a multicultural city, where Italian and foreign migrants coexist. You overcome these differences by seeking out what unites rather than ides us. My wife is Piedmontese, and we have two children. I am perfectly integrated culturally, socially and in my work.I am proudly Italian – we are a free, extraordinarily complex and unpredictable people. But I no longer recognise myself in the Europe of today, where nationalism is raging. The populism taking root in Italy is the expression of the failure of the political establishment over the past 25 years. Populist leaders are being asked to solve problems like insecurity and the decaying social fabric. People believe that European politicians have not regulated finance they have been at its service.Brexit is simply another way to ide us, and I don’t think it will bring benefits to the UK. I believe it will eventually be overturned by the people who oppose it.Interview by Lorenzo TondoBob Holderness, 48, is headteacher at The Parkside School, Norwich, a complex-needs schoolParkside is an urban school that takes pupils from the whole of Norfolk. All the specialist schools in Norfolk are heavily oversubscribed. We all face sustained pressure to admit more pupils to sites designed for far fewer pupils and staff. In the city centre we have the White Lion Cafe, where our pupils learn communication and interaction skills. It won a national award but we’ve had to make the decision to close it, as a direct result of our budget situation.I have been in education for 25 years. I have seen so many colleagues leave the profession, citing stress and burnout. It’s difficult to recruit people where we are geographically, flanked by the North Sea. However, at Parkside we have staff who have worked in the school for many years, including myself.Although I have lived in a number of other places, Norwich has always been my home. I was born in Sheffield – my dad was a history lecturer at Sheffield University he did some work on our family tree and we established that my mum’s family moved from Suffolk to Norwich in 1602. I feel a sense of belonging here.The original idea to twin communities after the second world war was to reduce the risk of future world conflict and promote cultural and economic links. Both of these ideas are still valid. The link between Norwich and Novi Sad in Serbia supported many joint education ventures. I recently got in contact with a former teacher who taught at Parkside in 1985, when the twinning first happened. A team went over, and they sent resources to a complex-needs school over there. When I arrived in 2002, that link had gone cold.From a historical and political perspective, I consider myself European. I have grave concerns over the ision of the country with Brexit. We need to work together to achieve a compromise.Violeta Strahinjevic, 47, is director of Milan Petrović School for children and young people with disabilities and special educational needs, in Novi Sad, SerbiaI became director of the school last year, but I’ve been working here for 22 years as a specialist teacher. One of the daily challenges we face is how to increase the acceptance of people with disabilities within the community. We try hard to include our children in local activities – the film festival, exhibitions, music festivals. It is essential for their social inclusion.We often collaborate with art students or professional artists – for our project Crossover they performed a stage musical in the city and surrounding villages. It is one of the many little steps we take to try to change attitudes. There is a long way to go, but I feel that in Novi Sad we are moving in the right direction.I feel equally a citizen of Novi Sad and a citizen of Europe. I think Britain should stay in the EU. It’s much more beneficial, not just for British people but for all of us, if Britain remains a member. But whatever happens, I am sure it won’t influence our friendship.Lisa Gunn, 44, is an artist who works in Coventry, and is involved in the CoventryDresden Arts ExchangeI was born in Walsgrave hospital in Coventry, and I grew up just outside the city. My father and his father were born here. Coventry is in our blood.I was in a road accident in April 1997, and the seatbelt broke my spine. I couldn’t do anything for four years I was in agonising pain. I was doing my art degree at Coventry University and my tutors were really supportive.My recent work is strongly connected with the ruins of Coventry cathedral and what they symbolise. It was devastated in the war – it’s like a skeleton – and I feel a metaphorical connection. We are both physically damaged, but we are still standing.I’ve only just become involved with the CoventryDresden Arts Exchange. I travelled to Dresden in February and took part in an exhibition called Condition Humaine, involving two artists from Coventry (including myself) and two from Dresden. It was organised around the anniversary of the bombing of Dresden in the second world war. We’ve all come from cities that rose from the ashes to create something new, and the work we’ve exhibited is inspired by that. The same show came to Coventry cathedral this summer.The Dresden trip was fantastic. My father came with me. Since I’ve been involved in this project, I’ve found out a lot about his early life. He was born under the living-room table in a Morrison shelter in an air raid on Coventry during the war.Everyone I met in Dresden was lovely – the artists and everyone connected with them. I made some great new friends. I invited them to come and stay with me.The economic impact of Brexit will definitely affect my work. Since the 2008 recession, people have become more careful about how they spend their money, and art is a luxury. I do sell work, but not as much as I used to.Kerstin Franke-Gneuss, 60, is an artist who lives and works in Dresden, and is involved in the CoventryDresden Arts ExchangeI have worked as a freelance artist in Dresden since 1984. I have a studio in the Künstlerhaus, the Artists’ House, which was built 120 years ago and is custom-designed for artists to live and work in. I make prints, and create big installations in public spaces. I can only make my art here in Dresden it is inspiring for me.The theme of this year’s exhibition of the CoventryDresden Arts Exchange is human existence in war and suffering, in reconciliation and peace. Twinning brings us closer to the “common European home” envisaged by Mikhail Gorbachev. This grand idea is being lost. Why would people want to have new borders? I come from the former GDR, and I know how small the world can be.With Brexit, there will be difficulties to overcome: new border controls, papers to fill in for customs clearance – a lot more hassle. This makes the connection and friendship between Coventry and Dresden all the more valuable.Milo Smith, 36, is general manager of Ninety-Nine Bar and Kitchen in AberdeenI’ve been general manager of an eclectic wee cocktail bar for five years, and I love it. Previously, I was an art teacher at a secondary school, but there was a lot of politics and paperwork, unnecessary stress, and too many hours. Believe it or not, when I became a bar manager I started working a lot less. I’ve worked in bars since I was 15, so it made sense to come back.The main challenge is the business rates, and how expensive everything’s getting. Taxes, and the cost of everything from sugar to alcohol to plastic, have gone up. The minimum wage is going up. The more you work to generate a profit, the harder it becomes.I think Brexit is a total farce. I’m someone who will roll my sleeves up and get on with whatever needs doing, but in this case we don’t know what to get on with. Most of the drinks we stock in our bar come from Europe. Our drinks suppliers import them, so any cost implications of crossing borders after Brexit will affect us.I was born in Aberdeen and I’ve lived here, on and off, for the better part of 35 years. I feel a strong identity with the city. It’s quite a close-knit community. Aberdonians are pretty stubborn, and we also like to have a good time. We’re the sort of people who will have a barbecue even if it starts to rain – we’ll just get the brollies out. We make the most of a bad situation.The last time I was in Stavanger was four years ago, for a friend’s stag do – he lives there. Both Aberdeen and Stavanger are oil and gas cities, and you can tell that as soon as you arrive. It has a similar feel, the same company names, the industrial-style buildings, trucks transporting goods.Kristine Ekeland, 26, and Steffen Rege, 28, are co-owners of Hygge bar in StavangerKristine I’ve been running the bar with my co-owner Steffen since March 2017. I imagine it’s a demanding job in any part of the world, but here you have different challenges: Stavanger is a small city – there are about 120,000 people living here. There is quite a good nightlife, but you’re fighting over the same customers.We designed the bar to create something unique. We have a gigantic wall of plants and a beer pong area. We’ve just renovated using wood from an old fishing boat. We get some tourists, but it’s mainly locals. We also get quite a few international students.Stavanger is home but my mum is from Brazil, so I can relate to both cultures. Steffen was born and raised in Stavanger. It’s only a small place, but there’s an aura here that always reels people back.Steffen The two cities have got oil in common – platforms in the North Sea. A plane goes to Aberdeen every day.I used to work for Halliburton in Aberdeen, and I thought the city was great, all the redbrick houses. The price of beer was a bit cheaper, but not much, and the food is different – a bit more greasy.I feel European. I’ve been to many places but I’ve never travelled outside of Europe. In terms of Brexit, there will be good or bad things whatever Britain does. It’s better to be able to do things yourself, than to be told what to do.Dr Steve Wharton, 56, is a senior lecturer in French and communication, and departmental Erasmus and assistantships director at the University of BathBeing an academic is one of the best jobs in the world. It gives you the chance to engage with young people, to help them to develop, and you get to do it alongside some pretty good colleagues.We do not live in an ivory tower, though. We face the same problems of pay, pensions and insecurity as any other profession. There was a national strike last year over changes to the pension scheme. I was on strike for 14 days.I’ve worked at the university and lived in Bath for half my life – I’m 56 now. I met my husband through the university. He now lives and works in Parma in Italy, so we travel backwards and forwards quite a lot. Brexit could affect that.I’m originally from Dorset, and I felt at home within about six months of moving here. Bath is a friendly place. If I’m at the bus stop I’ll talk to people and they won’t look sideways and move away, they will join in the conversation. There’s a remarkably international presence within the city, and that’s not just the students. It’s home to people from France, Spain, Italy, Germany… Being European is very much part of my identity – I’m a European Brit.When I was 21, I taught English at a school in Normandy for nine months. In the 90s, I taught at the Université Sorbonne Nouvelle in Paris, and I lived there when I was doing my PhD.The decision to leave the EU is a mistake the ridiculous mantra of taking back control of things we controlled already skewed the debate. I have colleagues who have broken down in tears because the website for registering an interest in remaining in the UK wasn’t working. As a UK citizen, I felt ashamed.The University of Bath has been proactive in contacting all of its international partners and saying it wants to continue working together. There is apparently a government promise to underwrite some kind of exchange programme. But quite what that will be is something none of us knows.Dr Mauve Carbonell, 40, is associate professor in history and director of the master’s programme in European and International Studies at Aix-Marseille University.Life as an academic in Aix is thrilling – and busy. In reality, I have two jobs: professor and researcher. I manage about 20 international cooperation agreements to encourage student and staff exchanges. The partnership with Bath is long-established and one of the most important and successful we have had.Every year we send six of our students to Bath and we welcome about six students from Bath on our master’s programme. Our students have an obligatory mobility period of six months in the spring semester and a lot of them decide to go to Bath. Erasmus agreements allow them to study abroad without paying additional fees to the host university to benefit from a grant, and to have their overseas study programme formally recognised.Aix-en-Provence is the city where I grew up as a teenager, where I studied 20 years ago and where I now work, after spending time elsewhere in France and Europe. It’s a part of my identity, but it has become a smaller part as my European identity has become stronger. First I got an Erasmus grant to attend the Humboldt University in Berlin. Then, for my PhD on European integration history, I travelled to European archive centres and met people involved in the birth of the European Community. I lived a truly European experience as a young researcher. I feel at home anywhere from Tallinn to Lisbon, from Galway to Athens.We fear Brexit will limit our students’ choices. Dismantling 70 years of economic and political ties is a sad and exasperating process.

The Dutch city of Utrecht is unveiling an answer at its railway station on Monday morning: the world’s largest multistorey parking area for bicycles.The concrete-and-glass structure holds three floors of gleaming double-decker racks with space for 12,500 bikes, from cargo bikes that hold a family to public transport bikes for rent.It is part of a strategy in which hundreds of millions of euros are being devoted to enhancing cycling infrastructure across the Netherlands, a nation so fervent about its two-wheelers that it is applying to add cycling to its inventory of intangible heritage.“We are striving to make it a cyclists’ paradise and there’s still much to be done,” said Stientje van Veldhoven, a junior infrastructure minister. “I’d like us to make better use of what I call this secret weapon against congestion, poor air quality in cities and climate change that is also good for your health and your wallet.”She added: “If you want to get people out of their cars and into public transport, you need to make sure using public transport is easy and comfortable. It needs to be very easy to park your bike as close to the train as possible – and you don’t want to be looking for half an hour for a space.”Demand for public transport is growing, the main four cities are predicted to expand, and the Netherlands has been struggling to meet its climate crisis commitments, so encouraging more bike use is a political priority.“In the next 10 years, 500,000 more people will come to urbanised areas, and if all of those people bring their car then we are going to have massive congestion,” said Van Veldhoven. “So investment in public transport, cycling lanes and cycle parking facilities is crucial to keep this area that’s essential for our national economy moving.”Utrecht is promoting cycling as part of a “healthy urban living” policy. “We are counting on biking as a healthy and sustainable form of transport for a growing city,” said the deputy mayor, Victor Everhardt. “Cycling is in the genes of people from Utrecht and in 1885 it built the Netherlands’ first bike lane. Every day, 125,000 cyclists go through the city centre to work, school and the station, and the world’s largest bike park sits perfectly in this global cycling city.”The scale of Dutch investments shows cycling is about more than just the issue of transportation, according to BYCS, a social enterprise behind a network of international cycle mayors. “The bike park in Utrecht shows you need massive investments into cycling infrastructure parking, cycle lanes and great architecture, but we believe this is one of the most impactful things a city can do,” said its strategy director, Adam Stones. “If you look at it as transformation – how it addresses mental and physical health, brings communities together and addresses resource use and the environment – you put more weight behind it.”But some experts sound a note of caution. Although the Fietsersbond, a Dutch cycling organisation, warmly welcomes the investment, it warns that it is irritating and counterproductive when bike parks are combined with a no-tolerance policy to on-street parking – as in central Amsterdam, where “wild” parked bikes are confiscated.“I am not a fan of this,” said its director, Saskia Kluit. “There’s a grey area growing where the government wants a clean appearance and wants to get rid of the bikes, but parked bikes give the street liveliness and movement, and if you want the benefit of the cyclist shopping, it’s better they can stop everywhere they want.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c2de1a4ca145aa83740210df24ef06936041718/0_0_5745_3447/master/5745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d8a6d4cad4707bf42f0683e00f637ea","title":"dominic cummings right today programme obsolete bbc","story":"The radio show typifies everything that is wrong with the BBC. Newsnight, on the other hand, is now a great watchThere is probably not much that Dominic Cummings and I would agree on, but we’re on the same page regarding the Today programme. “I never listened to the Today programme for the entire year of the referendum and I intend to repeat this while I am here,” he is said to have told staff at No 10 last week, urging his colleagues to avoid it.When I first went to work for another paper, the editor said I must listen to Today. I tried, zoned out and never felt uninformed. Thought for the Day is banal sentiment read out in a meaningfully slow voice. Politicans don’t answer questions. John Humphrys is rude and none of them appear to have realised that social media exist.It is Westminster talking to itself: dull, insular, self-important. They treat culture as a joke that they might give five minutes to. The rest of the country? Where is that?Women’s issues embarrass them. Miss it and you miss nada.Newsnight, though, now revamped under Esme Wren, is a great watch. Emily Maitlis is a forensic interviewer who clearly conveys her frustration as politicians blather non-answers.Time is given for serious but difficult subjects, such as Katie Razzall’s series on what happens to “looked after“ children over 16. Basically, they are shipped around the country and put into very dangerous environments.Today is everything that is wrong with the BBC, the Westminster lobby and the cosiness of political reporting.Often I have to turn off Radio 4 for class war reasons. The only time you hear a working-class accent is in some half-baked drama about domestic abuse.Today doesn’t make news these days, but still acts as if it does.

But all he wants is a general electionHistory is offering Jeremy Corbyn the gift of his dreams, and he is rejecting it. He has said he will do everything necessary to save Britain from the bizarre self-harm of no-deal Brexit, personally crafted by Boris Johnson. He will not.Corbyn will not lay aside partisan rhetoric and muster the parliamentary coalition that alone might bar no deal in the coming weeks, nor will he give way to other potential and less abrasive leaders of such a coalition. Every word Corbyn utters makes it ever more impossible for Liberal Democrats, nationalists or dissident Tories to lend him support, however temporary. Corbyn does not want to stop Brexit. He just wants a general election.In today’s speech, the Labour leader should have presented himself as the voice of majoritarian sanity. He should have sought to muster the erse tribes of political Britain to an emergency, to expose Johnson’s no-dealers as a masochistic minority. He should be reaching out to all Johnson’s opponents, talking, cajoling, compromising, fashioning the lowest common denominator of consensus. Corbyn should be the magnetic attractor of the “will of parliament”. As such, he would deserve the nation’s thanks for saving it from the disruption, hardship and expense of no deal – and for honouring the “frictionless border” that the Brexiters promised. Instead, he is simply aping Johnson. He is defaulting to the occupational disease of British politics – that it is about fighting elections, not governing countries.The Labour leader should recognise that he is in large part responsible for this crisis, by refusing to support Theresa May’s sensible withdrawal agreement. He voted against it even when such a vote was certain to lead to precisely the no deal he now claims to oppose. His motive then was not the national interest but to bring down May. He succeeded.Time has moved on. May’s agreement is still on the table, enabling a British departure from the EU on 31 October – in accordance with the 2016 referendum – while keeping the UK within Europe’s common economic area pending a final settlement. Any issues in such a settlement would be settled in the transitional period. Under the deal, both sides would live to fight another day.Despite the current noise, the sticking point to the May plan remains the Irish backstop. It is at least conceivable that its open-endedness might be negotiable with the EU – that is time-limited. But any such concession from the EU is implausible unless backed not just by the Irish but by a stable body of support within the British parliament. That support would require a leader and, for the time being, disciplined followers.Neither Johnson nor Corbyn can offer such leadership. Johnson does not care. Corbyn merely wants Labour to win an election. To that end, his best hope is surely now to behave like the saviour of a nation in distress."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a735ad1732ce8f0373947b7a08f58b4629c3b7b/510_304_5457_3274/master/5457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c0c0dd409ef744a0e319b92f364eb93","title":"no deal brexit disastrous mps brave enough","story":"In the cloudy realms of unreality befogging this cabinet of fanatics, the approaching Brexit cataclysm is only “some bumps in the road”. So says Michael Gove, the minister in charge of national preparedness. True, austerity has inured the country to bumps: there are officially 7.8 million unfilled potholes, a £10bn backlog of repairs. But the earthshaking Operation Yellowhammer report is likely to cause something more like a seismic shock to public opinion on Brexit.Try as they might to dismiss this as some remainer plot, Yellowhammer is a professional assessment drawn up this very month for this government drawn up for Boris Johnson and his hard Brexit cabinet. So hardly “old” and “out of date” as No 10 tried to claim. And this is what is most likely to happen – not a worst-case scenario. Dismissing it as “project fear” will only work with fingers-in-the-ears Brexit adamants: the public will be listening. If the cabinet refuses to believe these hard truths, they could sack the honest civil servants and find others who will tell the lies they prefer. Otherwise they must take this expert analysis seriously and turn back now.If they ignore it, then we are ruled by politicians who have taken leave of their senses. Leaving the European Union on 31 October “by any means necessary” has become such a monomania that they no longer seem to care what happens on 1 November. Odder still, they no longer care that if just a few of these warnings are right the Brexit crash-out will render them and their party unelectable for a generation.Jeremy Corbyn on Monday committed to calling a vote of no confidence within weeks, which could bring about a general election, so No 10 is warning any recalcitrant Tory MPs that their futures and their seats depend on Johnson winning that election. But talk to wiser Tories and they say growing numbers – now some 40 MPs – reckon their own survival and the very existence of their party depends on preventing Johnson charging straight over that no-deal precipice.The Sunday Times is a Brexit-backing Murdoch paper, yet editors considered it a duty to splash on this doomsday document supplemented with page after page of hair-raising warnings. The Brexit-backing Mail published the “Secret dossier’s 14 claims of chaos” in similarly startling detail. This may mark an earthquake moment, when some sense of imminent national meltdown drove these media organisations to warn their readers of no-deal reality before it’s too late. If you want a conspiracy theory with an optimistic twist, might they be terrifying their Brexit readers to soften them up for a Johnson climbdown?Does this government really, truly, have faith that the people’s passion for Brexit – any Brexit – is so deep and so universal that most voters will judge these “bumps in the road” a price worth paying? Pollsters and focus-groupers warn that most of those true believers would rapidly melt away: mysteriously, overnight, not many will be found to admit to clipboard questioners that they ever voted to leave at all.However delusional its thinking, the government does have one current advantage over its opponents: the “by any means necessary” single-mindedness that the remainers sorely lack.One brief perusal of the Yellowhammer papers should be enough to knock the preciousness and sectarianism out of anti-Brexit MPs of all parties. Those who claim to put saving the country from no-deal Brexit above all other causes will be put to the test. Brave and, yes, noble rebels will risk their seats and their careers, risk breaking their party, breaking with lifelong friends and colleagues, losing part of their own identity: these things hurt. How odd that many say they are willing to make those life-changing sacrifices – but not to work, even very briefly, with Corbyn. That absurd sticking point suggests a loss of any sense of proportion, almost as crazed as the no-dealers themselves.By all means let them list Corbyn’s defects and failings, the company he keeps, the things done and those left undone. His many equivocations on Brexit continue: on Monday he and John McDonnell were suggesting Labour take a neutral stand in a future referendum, a move that would be likely to drive away more Labour voters. Indeed, what an irony that Corbyn may yet be the one to lead the escape from Brexit. But he is leader of the opposition with 247 MPs. And he is not the bogeyman of Tory propaganda the red demon about to turn Britain into Venezuela. All things are relative: absolutely nothing he or his manifesto ever proposed has approached the radicalism of the hard-right Brexit experiment this government is subjecting Britain to. Nothing in his broadly social-democratic plans has come close to the revolutionary explosion Johnson intends in 10 weeks’ time.Holding their noses, if this is the only means, anti-Brexit MPs of all parties will need to back an interim government to delay article 50, call a referendum andor an election. Corbyn should invite a cabinet of all parties to guarantee this emergency regime has no other aim.But if they balk, if they fail, then here is Corbyn’s chance to redeem his Brexit reputation, showing himself the best of them all by nominating someone who could command a majority – it hardly matters who. His finest hour as the moderate compromiser putting his country first when others refused would send his chances of winning the election soaring up in the polls. His strong speech in Corby etched out a policy-rich election pitch, with well-honed attacks on Johnson. His greatest fall in popularity has been due to his Brexit foot-dragging – so he has most to gain from genuine willingness to do “whatever it takes”, if that crunch comes. We shall see if he has it in him.None of that drama may be needed if a majority of MPs succeed in their plan to halt Brexit by seizing control of the parliamentary timetable: the Speaker has pledged to ensure MPs are not overruled. But if they fail and at the last hour, the only salvation for the country is the extraordinary prospect of Tory MPs holding their noses and backing Corbyn, that’s what they must do.

But there are ways to quell these insatiable insectsWhen Janine Christley moved into her new house, she thought buying woollen carpets would be the sustainable option. She had the stairs and two floors of her cottage carpeted, at a cost of thousands of pounds. Then the moths moved in. She first noticed them about four years ago, just a few at first. But then they started devouring the carpets, creating big bare patches. Gradually, Christley has had to rip them up and replace them with synthetic carpet. “I’ve still got woollen carpet in my room and the front room, but there are big holes where they’ve eaten it away,” she says. To a family of moths, it turns out, a wool-carpeted house is essentially an all-you-can-eat restaurant.“Of course, they’re into clothes as well,” she says. They have eaten woollen jackets and gorged on the bags of wool she keeps for felting projects – as well as the finished works themselves. She has avoided chemical controls, but clothes regularly go into the freezer in an attempt to kill the moths’ eggs. “I’m constantly checking where they might be,” says Christley. “I go into the wardrobe and shake all my clothes regularly because they like to be dark and undisturbed. I check under furniture, swat any I can find. I’m always jumping up to try to catch them I see them flying around. I’m encouraging spiders in my house now they’ve got lots of cobwebs and I’m trying to get them to catch the moths.” It has been frustrating – and expensive. “And it’s all been a waste of time.”In houses up and down the country, there is a war being waged against clothes moths. Among other things, it features chemical weapons, smoke bombs and armies of tiny, parasitic wasps. While virtually all the 2,500 or so species of British moths are ecologically beneficial, there are two that eat textiles and objects derived from animals, including wool, silk, skin and fur. They will munch through antique rugs and treasured cashmere.There are a range of reasons for the rising numbers. Hotter winters are almost certainly to blame, plus the fact we keep our homes so warm. Our housekeeping is probably not what it once was, either. Washing clothes at a lower temperature saves energy, but it means eggs are not being killed. This is less of a problem if you wear something regularly, but lots of us have so many clothes that outfits go unworn for months or even years. “It’s thought also that, nowadays, wool and other materials are less often treated with insecticides, so you don’t have the residual effect that may have existed decades previously,” says Nigel Blades, a preventive conservation adviser for the National Trust. “It’s not always a wise use of insecticides, but it did have the effect of killing off moths.” In 2008, the EU banned the use of naphthalene, a toxic, flammable chemical long used in mothballs.There has also been a shift back to natural fibres in carpeting and clothing, which has created food for the pests. “One of the things that worries me is the push for natural fibres for insulation,” says Pinniger. “Wool insulation is great environmentally, but if you stick wool up in your attic you’re going to get moths in it. Even worse, I know one house where they blew wool in cavity walls. They can’t get it out and they’ve got moths – they’re going to have to live with moths the whole time they live in that house.”The previous owners of Emma Harrison’s house warned her there could be a moth problem when she moved in five years ago. She cleaned the house from top to bottom and put insecticides down. It didn’t work. She discovered her clothes were being ruined, including a treasured (and expensive) coat. Carpets were devoured and had to be pulled up. She has tried hanging up bags of herbs and cedarwood, but nothing has worked. “The only thing I’ve got left is either burn down my house or get the pest controllers in,” she says. “We’ve given up on repainting because all the walls are spattered. Every morning when I wake up there are about 10 or 12 on the wall. I don’t like killing creatures, but they’re a menace. I had a scarf that my grandmother gave me and that’s now mothridden, but I can’t bring myself to get rid of it. Every time you’ve got rid of them, they appear again.”That is often around this time of year. Moths will happily breed in warm, centrally heated homes throughout the year, says Pinniger, “but there is a peak of adult emergence usually in April and May, and often another one in late Augustearly September when you get another generation through. Some of the museums I work with, there are moths all year round because the temperatures are constant, and we’re getting at least three generations a year. Each female can lay 100 eggs. That’s a pretty big potential increase.”Moths don’t eat clothes their larvae do. They hatch within a few weeks of being laid. “When they first hatch, they’re only a millimetre long and they burrow into your clothes, so you don’t see them. It’s not until they get bigger that you see the evidence,” says Pinniger. In ideal conditions, he says, hungry larvae will take three months to mature into moths, but it could take up to nine months. That is a lot of munching time. “They don’t eat quickly, but when you’ve got a lot they can produce some quite nasty damage.”It is believed that case-bearing moths have been in the UK since at least Roman times. “We don’t know whether the Romans brought them over when they invaded, although we know they have been around a long time in the UK and northern Europe,” says Pinniger. The webbing clothes moth is thought to be a much more recent arrival it is not described in scientific literature until the Victorian era. “The theory at the moment is that it probably came over from South Africa in Victorian times when they imported a lot of skin and feathers.” They like the warmth – they thrive in heated buildings and aren’t normally able to complete their life cycle outdoors in the UK. “Whereas we know the case-bearing clothes moth can live in birds’ nests,” adds Pinniger.Clothes moths can’t fly very far, so it is unlikely that they come into homes through open windows, although this is possible in urban areas. They are almost certainly introduced to a home on something such as a vintage blanket, an antique rug or a sweater from a charity shop. “In the natural world, they live in things like birds’ nests and they’d be eating feathers and the remains of birds,” says Blades. “If a bird falls down a chimney, or you’ve got a birds’ nest in the chimney, that can be a source.” They may have lived for years in your house without you noticing. “And then suddenly the conditions are right and you get a population explosion,” says Pinniger.The National Trust uses pheromone traps as part of its monitoring programme – this doesn’t control the population, but gives an indication of the scale of the problem. The main approach for controlling numbers is regular cleaning. “Often that can be enough,” says Blades. “In some cases where we need to go beyond that, we use a commercial product called Constrain, which has a residual effect for a number of months. We use that to treat nooks and crannies where moths might like to hide away.” The National Trust has done a trial using tiny parasitic wasps, which seek out moths’ eggs and lay their own inside, hatching new wasps. (These wasps aren’t harmful to humans, don’t live long and are so small that you would barely notice them among house dust.) This was carried out in one property, but Blades says it isn’t yet clear how effective it has been. When an object such as a rug or costume has been affected, it is treated in a commercial chest freezer, where it is cooled to -30C. Mobile heat chambers are used for furniture with upholstery, where pieces are heated to about 50C.Dee Lauder, a pest control manager at English Heritage, has noticed a significant increase in moths in the past 10 years and particularly in the past five. “The best way of keeping on top of it is very good management and housekeeping,” she says. “We have collection-care assistants who are trained to go into the houses and carry this out all the time for us. These are increasingly the things you need to concentrate on in the average home as well. It’s not a case of running a vacuum over the carpet and thinking that’s done – at least once a month, and particularly during the spring and summer months, you need to thoroughly go round the edge of the carpet with a nozzle on the vacuum. Take out items in your wardrobes and give them a shake out because moths don’t like disturbance.” If you have carpet underneath your cupboards, you might want to think about getting rid of it, she says. “If you’ve got heavy items of furniture, and sofas, you need to be pulling them out at least once a month and thoroughly vacuuming underneath. This is how we keep on top of it in historic houses.”She recommends people store seasonal clothes in vacuum-sealed bags. “You can’t really do that with historic costumes. We’ll keep them boxed up and the conservators check them once or twice a year and make sure nothing is in them. Because of the significance of the collections, you cannot start spraying chemicals on them, which could cause more damage than the larvae themselves. Our approach has always been trying to do it in the most natural ways possible.” It is constant, she adds. “We never get a chance to relax.”Aerosol sprays and smoke bombs will kill moths, but if they have already laid their eggs then it is too late (they would soon die naturally anyway). Museums that Pinniger works with use insecticides concentrated around the edges of carpets, “which work reasonably well against the larvae”. Lavender sachets and cedarwood blocks may repel some adults for as long as the scent is strong. “But if the moth gets past your defences and lays eggs, it has no effect on the larvae.”The only things that work longer-term, he says, are removing the food sources, making an effort to clean thoroughly (including sweeping chimneys to remove birds nests and debris), regularly opening and disturbing dark hiding places such as drawers and wardrobes, and killing eggs by freezing clothes. “When you look back at early housekeeping manuals, they say you should keep your fur coats and thick jerseys in the cold store over summer.” Using a freezer as a kind of wardrobe isn’t necessarily as wacky as it sounds. Last year, the TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp said she keeps a small freezer next to her washing machine for her scarves and woollen coats. “I constantly put things in to freeze the eggs and stop them in their tracks,” she said. “I circulate the items that go in there to be as sure as possible that moths won’t suddenly strike.” Moths, she said, “are the bane of my life. I have spent a huge amount of money on products and pest controllers and have learned the hard way that the only way to keep your home moth-free is constant vigilance.”Is there any way we can reframe our relationships with clothes moths? “I would suggest avoiding the chemical blitzkrieg that we tend towards whenever we notice something alive around us, which we never tend to win,” says Rob Dunn, a professor of biology at North Carolina State University and the author of Never Home Alone, a book about all the tiny beings with which we share our homes.The idea that in the absence of a moth infestation your clothes are “clean” is wrong. “All of your clothing is covered with smaller species that you don’t see,” says Dunn of the microbes that live on your clothes, especially those made from natural fibres. “They’re busy living on your clothes, slowly breaking it down. So, even when you don’t have moths, the idea that your clothes last for ever is an illusion. You’ve also got your skin bacteria that wait for you to put clothing on and then they metabolise your sweat. With that motley crew, the clothes moth is the most charismatic of the bunch.”He suggests that, instead of reaching for the insecticide, we pay attention to moths. “They remain incompletely studied. See if you notice something that nobody has seen before. In and of themselves, they’re pretty fascinating species that have figured out a way to eat stuff that other species can’t eat. They’re beautiful, they fly around ephemerally learn to enjoy that. You don’t want them devouring all your clothes, but once they’re there, it’s worth a moment to reflect on their loveliness.” Can that really make up for a treasured cashmere sweater that has been lost, gobbled by the beasts? He laughs. “Maybe not.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04cebcf939c9e61888499fe64809ceb5b688a53e/0_229_2900_1740/master/2900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad2b4653de5fa896085aebe24d203c68","title":"south africa gets go ahead to increase black rhino trophy hunting","story":"Conservation groups split on impact of move agreed at international wildlife summitSouth Africa has won permission to almost double the number of black rhinos that can be killed as trophies after arguing the money raised will support conservation of the critically endangered species.The decision was made at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) after receiving support from some African nations and opposition from others.Poachers supplying the illegal trade in rhino horn decimated numbers in the past but the population is now growing. About 5,000 black rhinos exist today, almost 2,000 of them in South Africa.The request was opposed by Gabon, whose delegate said: “It is a very small population and threatened by poaching.” Kenya’s delegate said the move, along with poaching, would mean almost half the black rhino population increase each year being lost. NGOs also opposed the move, with Born Free’s delegate noting South Africa rarely used its existing quota.But South Africa was supported by other rhino range states including Botswana, Zimbabwe and Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), as well as the EU and Canada. South Africa agreed not to use the full quota if the rhino population fell below a certain level, but did not specify what this would be.Tom Milliken of Traffic, a wildlife trade monitoring group, said the higher quota could help increase black rhino numbers. Older males could cause conflicts, prevent younger males from breeding and even kill females, he said. “It is a positive: you are basically preventing bar-room brawls and getting faster reproduction rates going,” Milliken said.He said the black rhino was one of the highest-priced trophy animals, costing tens of thousands of dollars to hunt. “It really is providing conservation funds,” Milliken said.But Elizabeth Bennett of the Wildlife Conservation Society said: “WCS remains concerned about the impact of illegal hunting and trafficking of black rhinos for their horns. We encourage major efforts to ensure their protection, the prevention of trafficking, and that any trophy hunting is truly sustainable and supports, not undermines, the conservation of the species.”An earlier vote at the Cites meeting delivered a ban on wild African elephants being exported to zoos. Zimbabwe has sold dozens of elephants to Chinese attractions in recent years. The new rule says the only acceptable destinations are wild, native habitats.The vote outcome could be overturned in the final session of the summit, which signs off all decisions. This is because the EU, which opposed the move, failed to vote.The meeting of 183 nations, being held in Geneva, also considered the plight of sea creatures, and there was unanimous support for giving seahorses more high-profile protection. They are much sought after in the aquarium trade and for traditional Chinese medicine.The US delegate told the summit: “They are vulnerable because of their low birth rate, long parental care and habitat degradation. Ongoing illegal trade poses a threat to the survival of the species.”The summit also agreed to increase focus on the soaring trade in marine ornamental fish, including many coral reef fish and sharks. The trade supplying public and private aquariums has increased 60-fold since 2000, with 1.5bn fish now sold each year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea09f0162570b711fd7fd7f9932af27eca81ca48/0_112_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40c6c280fe733af6152575454786b009","title":"tell us how have you reused your wedding dress","story":"We want to hear if you opted for a non-traditional dress, or if you’ve repurposed it so you could wear it againWorn for the big day, gone tomorrow – for many people a wedding dress will be the single most expensive item of clothing they ever buy.

High in the stand at Son Moix, a Mallorca director edged forward and, he later admitted, thought: “Run, Forrest, run!” All around, 15,127 fans had pretty much the same idea. Down below, Dani did too. So he ran: fast and straight. “I set off like mad it felt like a whole herd chasing me,” he said with a grin – and he got away, reaching the edge of the area before anyone from Eibar could catch him: 40 metres, four seconds, four touches. A fifth and the ball was in the net.Rodríguez carried on running but this time the herd heading after him were his own players: primera. Fists were in the air, supporters leaping into each others’ arms, released at last, footballers tumbling and shouting. Mallorca were 1-0 up on the opening night. Only, the referee had his finger in his ear. Guadalupe Porras, his female assistant, the first in La Liga history, stopped and then they all did, as if someone had pressed pause. “You must have thought: ‘Hostia, bloody hell, don’t take this off me’,” Rodríguez was asked afterwards. “Yeah, and in those words,” he replied, “I didn’t even know what they were looking at: there was nothing wrong with it.”What they were looking at was Real Mallorca’s first goal in the first ision since 2013 and Rodríguez was right: there was nothing wrong with it. Just a lot that was right. Mallorca had been to hell and back, dropping from first ision to second and then to second B, down where pitches are far from perfect, municipal sports centres for homes, some worrying that their very survival was in doubt. But on Saturday night here they were, back again. Consecutive promotions, both via the play-offs – only the second team ever to do so after Granada in 2011 – had returned them to the top flight and they had scored within four minutes. It had been fast, even if it did not feel like it to some fans, and so perhaps another minute waiting for the VAR would not matter much. They had already waited six years after all.In a way his story was all of theirs a bunch of football players that probably never expected to be here but were not going to hold back now, 1-0 up and dominating, tearing into their opponents. Ante Budimir put one over from four yards. And while Eibar recovered, Fabián Orellana outstanding and Paulo Oliveira equalising, Mallorca did not fold. Instead they got the winner when Joan Sastre’s cross was deflected by Oliveira and looped in with 15 minutes left to make it 2-1, a result met at the end by a huge roar. It was, Diario de Mallorca said, a “first-class victory”. “A triumphant return,” Ultima Hora called it. “A sweet awakening.”“I could never have imagined this in my wildest dreams,” Salva Sevilla had said when Mallorca were promoted back to the first ision in June and he spoke for all of them there on Saturday. When Mallorca-born Xisco Campos, the club captain at 37, came on with four minutes to go to a huge cheer, it was his first top-flight game since the 2004-05 season and he played only three ever. “I was especially happy for him on his ‘re-debut’, and in his home,” the manager, Vicente Moreno, said.The day Salva Sevilla left Eyol, it was to join Mallorca in Segunda B. One could call it Spain’s third tier but, organised in four 20-team regional groups, usually excluded when people here talk about “fútbol profesional”, it is anything from third tier to seventh and known as “the well”. It is easy enough to fall into but almost impossible to climb out of again. Relegated from the first ision to the second in 2012-13, after 16 consecutive seasons there, Mallorca had been relegated again, falling into the well at the end of 2016-17.It was not supposed to be this way: Mallorca had been bought by Robert Sarver, owner of the Phoenix Suns, in January 2016, when he spent €20.62m on shares. His president is the former tennis player, Andrew Kohlberg. Steve Nash, the former basketball player, is on the board. So is Graeme Le Saux. And the CEO is Maheta Molango, a lawyer who scored 12 seconds into his debut at Brighton and also played for Lincoln, Oldham, Wrexham and Grays Athletic.Mallorca had come out of administration in 2012, with a payment plan that obliged them to return €40m over 10 years. The arrival of Sarver and Nash brought stability and promised the end of the bitter civil war that had crippled the club for so long. But as the Spanish phrase goes: if the ball does not want to go in … “Mallorca are a first ision club who happen to be in the second ision,” Sarver had said but by the end of the 2016-17 season they were not even that. For the first time in 36 years they found themselves out of “professional football”. “Everything that could go wrong did,” Molango said. “We’ve made mistakes and we’re sorry.” Javier Recio, the sporting director, vowed to “give back what we’ve taken away”.They did not throw it all away. There was patience and a plan. That summer they brought in the new coach Moreno, who had previously won promotion from Segunda B with Nastic. They approached some players with three-year contracts, not the usual single year, promising they were building to return, and constructed a team for Segunda B but also for beyond. Sevilla was their first signing, dropping from first to third tier. Others followed.He, Moreno and the rest made their debuts at Peralada, in a municipal ground that holds 1,500 against a team that had been taken over by Girona to be their B team. By the end of the season they had been promoted. By the end of the following season they had been promoted again. On Saturday first ision football returned to the island.“I never thought I was leaving the elite behind,” Sevilla insisted, but truthfully he never thought this either. None of them did. And even if they imagined Mallorca getting there, many would not have imagined getting there with them. Most teams, when they get to the first ision, obsessed by “experience” there, change almost the entire team, denying them the reward they fought for. Some ditch the manager too.Like Saturday’s opponents Eibar, a model for most to follow, Mallorca have not. Of the starting XI only Febas and Lumor Agbenyenu were new: five had played in Segunda B with them and four in the second ision (including Iddrisu Baba, from the youth team). It is true they have signed nine players and want four more before 2 September it is true, too, that they know it will be hard to survive and insist on humility – acting “as if we were the shittest of the shit” – aware that, at €29m, they have the ision’s smallest operating budget. It is also true that they won promotion on 23 June, a month after everyone else had finished, denying them preparation time. They know they will have to wait to see which players are left. But Saturday’s line-up was not just circumstantial nor was the result. It is the way they want it.As one beaming director put it after the game, long after everyone had gone: “I really, really like my team.”So does Moreno, although he is pushing for more players. Already revered on the island, he was making his first ision coaching debut at the same ground as he had made his first ision playing debut for Xérez a decade before. “Seven of those who played with us in Segunda B got on the pitch tonight. What sometimes looks like a handicap can be an advantage,” he said afterwards. “Having players from before allows our ideas to be put into practice more quickly.” Then he added something that, at least at some level, is even more important: “And this is a group of players who deserve to enjoy this opportunity because they’re the ones who brought us here.”On Saturday night Mallorca’s players did. They had earned it, nobody else. And they took it. Fast. It was early when Dani Rodríguez set off running and late by the time he left, walking out of Son Moix with his son, “Papá 14” printed on the back of a mini-Mallorca shirt. “Life can be wonderful,” he said as he went.• You are 38 and a half, you are beginning your last ever season, time almost up, you go on with two minutes left, not long enough to do anything, and your opponents are Barcelona. Yeah. And? Erm. And you are Aritz Aduriz, so you do what you do, of course. The strange case of the man who gets better as he gets older and who took that penalty got even more stupidly brilliant when he scored a ludicrous overhead kick to defeat Barcelona and send San Mamés wild. “He’s an animal,” Athletic Bilbao’s manager, Gaizka Garitano, said. “I have coached a lot of players but no one quite like him.” So, could the season’s best goal end up being its first?• 21 July: Zinedine Zidane says the sooner Gareth Bale leaves, “the better”. 17 August: Bale starts Real Madrid’s opening game of the season, provides the superb assist for the opening goal in a 3-1 win at Celta – meaning Madrid are ahead of Barcelona and top for the first time in 818 days – and heads home post-game having heard his manager say: “He’s staying.”• Another Briton, another assist. On a very impressive debut, Kieran Trippier produced a wonderful ball for the only goal for Atlético against Getafe. That said, a moment from João Félix eclipsed everything else. Somehow, he went 70 metres, past three, getting kicked, pushed and pulled, all the way up the other end, part power, part quality, part sheer bloodymindedness, all genius, to win a penalty. Which Álvaro Morata missed.• Chimy Ávila belter. Three words that vont tres bien ensemble. The scorer of last season’s best goal did it again – and on the opening day once more.• And, yes, the refereeing could even have got worse. Which is pretty impressive.• Full Monchi. Sevilla had seven new signings in their side and a new manager, too. Julen Lopetegui ’s team beat Eyol 2-0.• It was a good weekend for the new teams: Mallorca won, Osasuna won (somehow) and Granada scored four but did not win. Which leads us to … • Always go to Villarreal. Well, obviously: Santi Cazorla’s there. And he scored this weekend. As did Roberto Soldado on his return to Spain. But there is more, as Spain’s premier soccer statistician Mr Chip noted this weekend after a 4-4 draw with Granada: there have been 7,076 games this century and only 10 4-4 draws. Four of those have been at the Madrigal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0fd144c6cb39b78399968651ea81fc300670dd2/85_138_3364_2019/master/3364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=548c9d9414c740db5c707c9f156c47fe","title":"wolves v manchester united premier league live","story":"35 min Pogba plays a lovely pass down the right to James, whose first-time cross is intercepted by the stretching Coady.

It’s an interesting game, but not yet an exciting one.24 min Dan James has been booked for ing. That looked a good decision from Jon Moss, although replays suggest he might have been caught. It’s hard to be sure. What we do know is that he’s going to be booed for the rest of the game.23 min “Given both teams’ strengths on the counter,” says Oliver Atkinson, “this feels like the sort of game where Wolves are having the better of it on account of United having all of the ball.”Yes, Wolves have looked the slightly more dangerous team, even though they’ve only had about a quarter of the possession.19 min Here’s Sean Clayton on the subject of bogey teams. “It feels like a long time ago but Sheffield Wednesday absolutely owned Man United for several seasons in the late 80s and early 90s. In retrospect, that late brace of injury time goals by Steve Bruce was the beginning of a long decline for the mighty Owls...”18 min Pogba sprays a long crossfield pass to Rashford on the left. He twists Bennett one way and then the other before curling a wicked inswinging cross that just evades Martial in the six-yard box.18 min Wan-Bissaka makes a good tackle to stop Jota’s run down the left. Jimenez and Jota look really sharp on the counter-attack. 16 min Pogba fouls Jota 40 yards from goalk. Moutinho’s inswinging free-kick is headed away by Harry Magnet.14 min United are struggling to get behind the Wolves defence, which is so well organised. There’s so much pace in this United team, but there isn’t. Pogba excepted, a huge amount of guile.12 min Under normal circumstances you’d say this has been an excellent start for United, who have dominated possession (72 per cent) and played with breezy purpose. But given their recent history with Wolves, they might wonder whether they are walking into a trap.10 min “Obviously, I’m no United fan,” says Matt Dony. “ But I am a very big admirer of Dan James. He is terrifyingly fast, with a decent end product, and just seems like such a damn nice young man. I’m looking forward to watching him tear up trees for Wales, and hoping he gets the chance to develop at United. And, you would need a heart of stone not to smile at the sheer, unadulterated, childlike joy in his goal celebration last week. Go on, son.” 10 min Shaw’s corner is headed clear at the far post.9 min Now it’s United’s turn to counter, from that Wolves corner, and James wins a corner at the other end.9 min The corner is slabheaded away by Maguire.8 min James loses the ball on the right - I thought he was fouled, but Jon Moss didn’t - and Wolves spring forward to win a corner at the other end.5 min United have had almost all of the ball in the first five minutes, though Wolves won’t really mind that. They are lethal on the break.3 min “I like Lingard, he’s a decent player who always puts in a shift,” says Sandile Xaso, “but how much better would this team look with a class act like James Maddison in it? It was startling to see him not only be the best player on the pitch at Stamford Bridge yesterday, but by such a large margin.”Yes, I really like Maddison, who looks a class act. I suspect he will have a lot of suitors next summer.2 min A couple of lively early challenges, first from McTominay and then Coady. Both were fair tackles, but they were also meaningful.1 min Peep peep! Wolves, in the old gold, kick off from right to left. United are in red.We’re having a few technical issues, but they’ll hopefully be sorted before kick-off. The players have just emerged to the usual cracking atmosphere.“Do you know if the average age of this United team remains the youngest in this week’s round of PL fixtures?” says Matt Richman. “I have to say I’m impressed with the repeated faith in the team’s youth.” It is, yeah. It’s also slightly younger than the Chelsea team, with James (21) replacing Pereira (23). Daniel James makes his full debut for United, replacing Andreas Pereira. Wolves are unchanged from their last Premier League game, the 0-0 draw at Leicester eight days ago.Hello. Manchester United have had some unlikely bogey teams down the years. West Brom in the late 1970s Norwich in the late 1980s Southampton in the mid 1990s Middlesbrough in the early 2000s just about everyone since 2013. Their newest nemesis is Wolves, who tonight are aiming to beat United at Molineux for the third time in less than six months.Their two 2-1 wins last season – one in the FA Cup, one in the league – sent United into a tailspin after that amazing start under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. They showed the first signs of recovery with a stirring 4-0 win over Chelsea last weekend, but this is a different - and arguably tougher - test. In those two games last season, Wolves dictated the match by not dictating it – both teams prefer to play on the counter-attack, and Wolves had less of the ball each time. They rode their luck a little in the league, but the FA Cup performance was a masterclass in playing like the away side at home. They will use exactly the same tactics tonight. It’s up to United to do something about it.Kick off is at 8pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaeb408e7c6a718acfdafa216d3a7eebe9531ed1/0_317_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d1e71a82d5d5bd1d1607b7921817609","title":"india homemade baby food big business","story":"Entrepreneurs are cooking up wholesome alternatives to sugary baby formulas in a country where only one baby in 10 gets the recommended nutritionWhen her baby was six months old, Dr Hemapriya Natesan found herself appalled by the sugary commercial baby food available. With her mother, she began to make batches of mullaikatiya sathumaavu, a traditional porridge for weaning infants in Tamil Nadu, southern India.It’s a painstaking 10-day process with more than 15 grains, lentils and nuts. Many of the ingredients are first sprouted, then sun-dried in the sweltering heat before being slow-roasted, ground and sieved.Natesan shared the old recipe on her blog, and parents from all over the country began to write to her, asking to buy the porridge. Four years on, her company, My Little Moppet, employs around 15 women making organic baby foods to order.“If we start weaning babies with these kinds of foods, they’ll like only processed foods later on,” said Natesan. Research suggests that her concerns are not unfounded. A study published in the British Journal of Nutrition in 2016 found that higher consumption of commercial baby foods is associated with higher added sugar intake in preschool and primary school, relative to consumption of home-cooked foods.Natesan is not alone. Other entrepreneurs have been setting up their own brands in India, and traditional weaning foods are now appearing on shelves alongside tins of Cerelac and Farex. There’s Early Foods’ sprouted whole grain porridges, Mimmo Organics’ pastas made from lentils and carrot, and Slurrp Farm’s dosa mixes made with finger millet and spinach, to name a few. “We just wanted to go back to feeding our kids what our grandmothers fed us,” said Slurrp Farm co-founder Shauravi Malik.Market leader Nestlé is aware of the issue. In an email interview, a spokesperson told the  that “as part of our Eat Right campaign, Nestlé India has signed a pledge, where we are consistently reducing sugar in our products and reformulating our recipes. These efforts go beyond local regulations and are in line with the WHO’s recommendation to reduce the intake of sugars.” Nestlé did not offer specific details about these reformulated products, or when they would be made available.But parents like Natesan want more than corporate pledges and are turning back to alternatives rooted in traditional Indian foods and erse ingredients, from amaranth and millet to mung beans and lotus seeds. Baby foods are boldly flavoured with spices such as turmeric, cardamom, caraway seeds, and pepper, many of which are believed to have medicinal properties and aid digestion. “They make the food tasty too, so we don’t need to add salt and sugar,” said Natesan.But these entrepreneurs continue to expand and find ways to get their close-to-homemade products to more babies. Slurrp Farm, soon to launch a range of millet-based drinks for toddlers, has just expanded to the UAE, and later this year, they intend to bring their products to the UK. Priyanka Shetty Sridhar, of Mimmo Organics, plans to take her brand to Sri Lanka and the Middle East. “We want to tell mums everywhere we’re here, and we’re different. We’re doing things differently,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30ccb84c22fc89462fe415eba880600d91c1e134/0_53_960_576/master/960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f09031270a40c5a98534e53786f4972","title":"how we met when i saw his profile picture i thought what have i agreed to go on a date with","story":"Charlotte and Jack Cook live in Cambridgeshire. Charlotte, 25, is a teaching assistant for children with special educational needs. Jack, 31, is a land agentThe first time Charlotte and Jack met – as her first shift at a clothes shop ended and his began – they talked for about 15 minutes and Charlotte went home with a giddy feeling. “I was like: ‘Mum, there’s this guy at work and he’s so cute and he seems really nice,’” she says. “I was thinking about him all week, because we were going to be on the same shift the following Saturday, and I was so excited. When I got there I said: ‘Hi, how’s it going?’ And he said: ‘I’m Jack, nice to meet you.’ I was so crushed.”Jack laughs. “I don’t remember us meeting. But that second time we met, I was very taken with Charlotte.” They chatted throughout their shift. “It was long hours,” he says. “We talked about everything from where we went to school to what type of food we liked. The manager pulled me to one side and said I needed to stop talking to Charlotte because I was distracting her from her work.” And did he? “No.”It was November 2011. Jack had finished university that summer and was working in the shop, and Charlotte, still at sixth form, had taken a Saturday job there for the Christmas period. After working that shift together, they exchanged numbers and agreed to go out on a date. “Then he added me on Facebook,” says Charlotte. “I took one look at your profile picture and I thought: ‘What have I agreed to go on a date with?’ Because it was so cringe – you had one leg cocked and your collar up, leaning against the door frame.” Jack laughs. “I obviously thought it was a good one.”They went out anyway, to the cinema, where they watched a terrible film. “It gave us lots to talk about,” says Jack. On their second date, they took a picnic to a local stately home and walked up to the folly (it would be the location where, five years later, Jack would propose to Charlotte). “I think we were official quite quickly,” says Charlotte.What did she like about him? “I thought he was quite cheeky. Jack is the sort of person who will go up to anyone and talk to them and instantly make them feel really comfortable. He’s just very cheerful.” Jack says: “She was very attractive but very down to earth, quirky, a bit of a bookworm.”Charlotte went to university in Liverpool after finishing school, and the relationship survived the distance and time apart between visits. “I came back from university …” says Charlotte. “I remember the date,” says Jack. Charlotte says: “I had a year when I lived with my mum and dad, and you lived with your mum and dad.”They got engaged in March 2016, and moved in together in August that year. “We never lived together until we bought a house together,” says Jack.Why does it work? “I think we balance each other out in a lot of things,” says Charlotte. “Our values are quite similar. However, our likes and personalities are quite different.” Whereas Jack is practical and methodical, Charlotte says she is “the complete opposite. I’m quite chaotic and maybe don’t think about things in the most straightforward way. Which is good, because sometimes you do something and I think: ‘I never would have thought of that, but it makes life so much easier.’ We both make each other think of things differently.” Jack says: “It’s good to be with someone who surprises you. Our approaches are quite different but I like to think we share a lot of goals.”They married in July 2017 and their son, Arthur, was born last year. They also have a dog and an allotment. “We knew that at some point the thing we would like was to live somewhere rural and have a family and quite a simple life,” says Charlotte, and they have made it happen.Want to share your story?

I went to university with plans to reinvent myself, explore new relationships and broaden my cultural horizons. As it was, by the time freshers’ fortnight was over, I had met my life partner. He was funny, wrote love limericks and had curtains that perfectly framed his delicate face. I had found a fellow nerd, but one who had come through the other side of his shy teenage years.We had a tempestuous relationship early on, with a few breakups. After another split in my final year, we got back together at the graduation ball. He moved for graduate training and I followed, but we went our separate ways shortly after in circumstances that felt final. I decided to travel across the US, spending my savings on a flight to New York that flew out on 911. I came back to the UK a month later to restart my life near my parents.Time passed, we became friends again, and then a couple, before finally moving in together, six years after we first met. A serious family health scare made marriage seem right suddenly. I was 30 and ready to settle down, but he said he wanted to wait a year before trying for children. I assumed most women are very fertile until the age of 35, so I acquiesced. I had no idea that we were about to embark on a five-year journey of unexplained infertility.After about a year of trying, we took a holiday in the Lake District to reconnect and relax. It rained constantly and, while taking refuge in a little town, we came across a music shop. I hadn’t been in one since I was a child. I had lessons then, but shied away from taking exams. In the window was an electric piano. It piqued my curiosity. The shop’s owner insisted on giving a demonstration, despite my protestations that I was on holiday, hadn’t played in years and had no space.The seed was sown. When we got home, I rejigged the front room and found a local piano dealer who sold me the model I had seen in the Lake District. He was an old guy, almost blind and hard of hearing. For 20 years he hadn’t played, but eventually went back to the piano and loved it so much that he opened a music shop. I took this to be a positive sign.I taught myself the pieces I thought I had forgotten. The tiny muscles in my fingers were weak at first. Thirty minutes’ practice felt torturous, but I felt the strength return. The desire to improve the sound coming out of my headphones was addictive. Playing the piano consumed the acres of spare time you can have as a reclusive infertile couple, which I felt we had now become. When every month’s unwanted period felt like starting back at square one, the piano allowed me to feel a sense of progress.At the same time, I repeatedly questioned why we had waited well over 10 years into our relationship to try to conceive. The only person to whom I expressed our infertility fears was my GP, as I was determined it would not define us. Keeping our own expectations in check was enough. My social life slowly contracted: I avoided drinking with friends because it felt as if it could jeopardise our diminishing chances of getting pregnant. I worked in a coffee-fuelled environment, but resorted to excuses of caffeine-induced tooth-grinding to account for my change in drinking habits.I retreated into what could have been a very destructive place. The choice of pieces I learned reflected my sense of isolation. One day, I found myself playing Ralph McTell’s Streets of London. The arrangement had beautiful arpeggios that lifted my mood despite the loneliness of the lyrics.It made me realise that I could lose myself in the melodies I was playing, even if the narrative of my life was in a minor key. I am sure playing the piano positively rewired my brain. I have no natural ability and only play for my own pleasure, but I discovered that finding pleasure was the key to feeling relief.Finally, at the age of 36, on our second round of IVF, I became pregnant with twins. Forceps and an emergency caesarean later, I found a new all-consuming passion, with two mouths to feed and entertain. My early 30s could have been bleak, but a chance rediscovery of my childhood hobby was the key change I needed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48205f60c3e5f8224c41c6b1cab3c71725fe974e/0_300_5811_3488/master/5811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8de91736e2d29d6a1aa84444269a1be","title":"do not feed the pigeons and nine other unwritten rules about london","story":"London is a city with its own quirks and customs, but this Londoner’s guide will help you avoid any sticky situations when visiting the capital ...The tubeFor something that has the sole aim of getting people from A to B, the tube is fraught with potential faux pas. One main rule is that you should always stand on the right on escalators. If you dare to break this, you’ll be met with a lot of muttering and eye-rolls, although no one will dare to berate you personally. You must also never, ever make eye contact with a stranger on the tube, or, worse, smile at them. This invades the Londoner’s sense of private space, even if you’re standing in a different carriage.Pigeons come sprinkled with a touch of glamour when they’re gathered en masse in St Mark’s Square in Venice not so much when they’re in Trafalgar Square on a drizzly Tuesday. Do not feed them, do not encourage them to come near you, and do not interact with them at all. They say ‘beware the flying rats’ for a reason.London may not quite be New York – although we’re certainly trying to keep up the skyscraper count – but it still loves its bagels. A fierce rivalry exists between the city’s two classic purveyors on Brick Lane in-the-know purists head to Beigel Bake at number 159 for its hot salt beef with mustard, while its neighbour at number 155, Beigel Shop, does a mean smoked salmon with cream cheese. Beigel Shop has been here since 1855, while upstart Beigel Bake only started in 1974, but both are open 24 hours – and, boy, the service only gets better from two in the morning.Oxford StreetTo outsiders, it’s still seen as a shopping nirvana: over a mile of high-street stores and the odd independent boutique. Londoners, however, know there are better options nearby for the shopper uninterested in souvenir stores (although hats off to Selfridges, a true gem). Try Spitalfields for an East End market buzz, or Dover Street in the West End for high fashion and price tags to match.The Tower of LondonNot many Londoners have actually ever been inside this, but they do know that it’s brimming over with history, stuffed with ravens, and there are some rather nice crown jewels inside. Oh, and that there are a couple of princes still stuck in the actual tower, although we’re not exactly sure what they’re doing there.Crossing the riverOnce you are friends with a Londoner, your allegiance is not only to him or her, but to the area north or south of the river where they live. If you are loyal to someone from the north, you must never go south, and vice versa. Crossing the river is something Londoners only do in an emergency (or for work, if their job happens to be on the opposite side of the Thames from where they live), and weekends must be spent not only in one’s designated compass point, but also bad-mouthing the other.A Londoner will raise his or her head from theirs only if he or she is literally about to be run over by a bus. Otherwise, forget it. Walking down a London street is a bit like playing a game of Frogger, only you’re on a pavement, and the “cars” are phone-obsessed pedestrians. Don’t expect anyone to come and help if you’re looking lost, or start chatting if you’re in a pub everyone will be on their phone, browsing Tinder, booking an Uber, or playing whatever the modern version of Frogger is.One of London’s finest traditions is the illustrious black cab, immediately recognisable by their yellow illuminated signs, shuddering, noisy diesel engines, and adorably knowledgeable drivers, who love nothing better than to get into a debate about their favourite football team, and the performances of its starting eleven over the weekend – you can bank on the fact that each one would have played better if the driver himself was their manager, of course. It’s up to you whether you get involved in the conversation, although this may also depend on how many pints you have sampled at that other Great British institution, the pub.PubsLondon pubs tend to be full of history this also sometimes means they are full of threadbare carpet, peeling wallpaper, and musty cellars. Don’t let that stop you buying a pint of possibly overpriced lager, however, because that atmosphere does not just contain damp it also contains the breath of a thousand London icons – actors Peter O’Toole and Diana Dors, painters Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud, gangsters such as the Kray Twins, and musicians from Dizzee Rascal to David Bowie.Sometimes it’s nice to leaveAs cosmopolitan and fascinating as London is, sometimes it’s nice to explore beyond it.

You can find eclectic delights in every corner, and BBC Radio 6 Music-friendly fortysomethings navigate the spotless, hill-ringed site with similar fervour to the many infants that roam freely. Between stalls offering Japanese kumihimo braiding, tree ring printing and candle wax powered boats, the only gripe you could have is that you may miss more than you will see.Oh, and there’s the music, too. In its 17-year history, Green Man has progressively twisted its folky image into exciting and intriguing new shapes, perhaps best displayed this year by the top billing of Four Tet. His face-melting, rippling left-field electronica turns his Saturday night headline slot into a mega-party that confidently dispels the idea that Green Man can’t large it up.The other main-stage headliners prove otherworldly, too. Yo La Tengo carve out few epiphanies, but they still impress. The trio ceaselessly switch between instruments to flesh out 90 mesmerising minutes of psychedelic freakouts, which fall somewhere between art and accessibility. But the weekend ultimately belongs to Father John Misty, a consummate showman and operational ironist of the highest order, whose intoxicating mix of histrionic outbursts and indulgent folk rock finds a fitting backdrop in the Brecon Beacons’ dramatic, verdant peaks.That kind of wacky eccentricity thrives here: Green Man Rising 2019 winners Jerry shake up the Black mountains with a scrappy avant-garde take on postpunk that recalls the knowing anarchy of Parquet Courts. As they unleash a barrage of urban ska epics on to a curious mid-afternoon crowd, their choppy vocals and wiggy riffs swarm like flies – they’re vital and ecstatic. And Squid reinforce with a twiddly postpunk antidote to the many acoustic guitars that dominate the Walled Garden stage, rattling tambourines and cowbells with untamable, cartoonish energy.Stealing Sheep later prove that unexpected moments of communal joy underpin the weekend’s finest memories – their meticulously choreographed showpiece of theatrical posturing and high-octane dance routines is a bolt from the future, and an inflatable pink sheep bounces across animated punters in tandem with their visceral, industrial electropop. Meanwhile, Matt Baty, the chest-pounding frontman of psych-metal purveyors Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs is the most unlikely ambassador of Green Man’s ethos of inclusivity and community “Rock music should be wholesome, hydrating and nourishing. It’s for all of us,” he says after two songs.Blending upright bass cycles with direct, whip-smart lyrics, the Big Moon deliver guitar-forward indie pop with aplomb. They spool out the cream of their Mercury-nominated debut, and gamely road test new grunge-textured songs in front of a packed Far Out tent. At the end of the set, frontwoman Jules Jackson receives an on stage marriage proposal from her boyfriend. She gleefully accepts, the occasion apt for a festival that seems to run on love and wonder.When the Green Man effigy is razed in its traditional Sunday evening burning, the masses unite to gaze at the sparks that shoot dazzlingly into the patchwork skies. At times like this, it becomes easy to forget that beyond these fields, there exists a world that is becoming increasingly devoid of Green Man’s core values of compassion and community."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e39d4d8d46b8e15c29411da9981b47f4b30d2217/51_49_3396_2259/master/3396.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea318b474c96960f8e9636cc1cdd1aee 720w","title":"labour may stay neutral if second referendum is between its brexit deal or remain","story":"Corbyn says Labour will back remain against no deal as McDonnell hints he may do so whatever the second optionJeremy Corbyn has left the door open to staying neutral in a second referendum if the choice were between a Labour Brexit deal and staying in the EU, after his shadow chancellor, John McDonnell suggested he would campaign to remain in any circumstances.The Labour leader was clear that the party would campaign to remain against a no-deal Brexit, as he pledged to do everything possible to prevent crashing out on 31 October.But when asked if the party would stay neutral given a choice between a deal negotiated by Labour and remaining in the EU, Corbyn did not say which side the party would support.“In a general election, we will put forward the opportunity for people in this country to have the final say,” he said on Monday. “It is not a rerun of 2016. It is simply saying the people of this country should make the final decision.“If it is no deal versus remain then obviously John McDonnell and others made it very clear we would support remain.

What we are offering is to transform our society and our economy.”Asked whether he would personally campaign to remain in those circumstances, he said: “We have been very clear that in accordance with the democratic decision taken by our conference last year, an incoming Labour government will facilitate a choice where everyone will have a choice between a deal or remaining in the European Union.”The precedents for neutrality would be the 1975 referendum, when the then Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, allowed his cabinet to campaign on either side for and against membership of the European Community, while David Cameron also made the same decision for the Conservative party to stay neutral in the 2016 referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU.Earlier, McDonnell appeared to take a different line when he made clear he would campaign to remain in the EU whatever the other option put forward in a second referendum.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think generally people want to provide the electorate with a choice. I’ve made it clear from my personal position that I’ll be campaigning for remain. I think that’s the best choice.“But people will want to have a say and see whether there is another option. But we’ve had that debate in parliament and that’s why I’ve come down in favour of remain because I can’t see one that will have the same benefits as remain.”He was asked if he would be happy for the party as a whole to be “agnostic” on the issue, despite his personal wish to campaign to remain in the EU.McDonnell replied: “That’s one of the issues we’ve got to debate in the party. You know our democratic processes. I know people get frustrated with this … but we’re a democratic party.”The party’s policy could change at this year’s conference, where there will be a strong effort from pro-EU groups to shift Labour towards being an official remain party in all circumstances.Corbyn set out his position in a speech in the key marginal Tory-held seat of Corby in the east Midlands, where he made the case that the UK’s problems run much deeper than Brexit.“A general election triggered by the Tory Brexit crisis will be a crossroads for our country. It will be a once-in-a-generation chance for a real change of direction, potentially on the scale of 1945. Things cannot go on as they were before,” he said.“However the Brexit crisis is resolved, the country faces a fundamental choice. Labour offers the real change of direction the country needs: a radical programme to rebuild and transform communities and public services, invest in the green jobs and high-tech industries of the future, and take action to tackle inequality and climate crisis.”The Labour leader accused Boris Johnson of being a “fake populist and phoney outsider” in the mould of Donald Trump as he set out his election pitch to transform the country as radically as Labour did in 1945 with the creation of the welfare state.He also said Labour would do everything possible to stop a no-deal Brexit and called on opposition MPs and rebel Tories to “get on board” with his plan to hold a no-confidence vote, then form a caretaker government to extend article 50 and hold a general election.Asked whether he could support another caretaker leader if he could not gain cross-party support, he said it was a role for the opposition leader to take on.Following the leak of documents warning of protests and food shortages in the event of a no-deal Brexit, he attacked Johnson for the Conservative party’s “failure on Brexit, and its lurch to the hard right, which has provoked the crisis our country faces this autumn”.“Boris Johnson’s government wants to use no deal to create a tax haven for the super-rich on the shores of Europe and sign a sweetheart trade deal with Donald Trump: not so much a no-deal Brexit as a Trump-deal Brexit,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e39d4d8d46b8e15c29411da9981b47f4b30d2217/69_117_3381_2028/master/3381.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9571686bb46745cecaaa4ee2872bcfc","title":"the monster to slay before domestic policies is brexit readers on corbyns speech","story":"You have been reacting in the comments to Jeremy Corbyn’s speech on Labour’s vision to rebuild BritainYes Jeremy, I agree. You are absolutely right. The problems of the UK run far deeper than Brexit. The thing is, the country did vote for Brexit. Millions of people who will suffer the consequences of Brexit voted for it. People whose prospects are so poor that they voted for Brexit on the assumption that things can’t get any worse. But he also has to acknowledge the fact that we cannot go on to do that with the threat of Brexit hanging above our heads. It will make everything so much worse, and take away our ability to address the issues that are causing so much misery and poverty. Brexit will not lead to any short term or mid term increase in job or wealth creation. It will have the opposite effect for most ordinary people. Corbyn’s priority must be to stop any possibility of a no-deal Brexit – then to stop any form of Brexit. Even a soft Brexit with a deal will leave us worse off. He must be prepared to stand aside to allow someone else who can command a majority to become caretaker PM. It will only be a temporary position until Brexit is resolved and a general election is called. Then he can come back as Labour leader and fight that election. pocclondonAs a Labour member, its excruciating (and embarrassing) to watch Corbyn flail about like this. I’m entirely on board with our domestic policy program under Corbyn but he is never ever going to win a general election. His main appeal was the honesty and consistency which marked him out as different. Now he doesn’t even have that after pretending to campaign for Remain (i.e. disappearing) when everyone knows he loathes the EU. We’re heading for a no deal Brexit and it will be Labour’s fault. Mark ForresterSadly Corbyn is still pushing for a GE as the solution rather than a people’s vote. It looks as if he is walking straight into Johnson’s trap as the latter will be able to set the election date in his own favour. Brexit for the Tories will be more than enough to wipe out Labour. It’ll happen before the country has woken to the chaos of Brexit. Corbyn should never give Johnson what he wants – a GE, before it’s obvious to the country that his Government is sunk in Brexit chaos and exuding incompetence from every pore. FogintheChannelGreat rhetoric Corbyn. But surely the monster to tackle right now, right here, is Brexit. That is the monster to slay before domestic policies. Brexit has to be lanced first. Or can you tell us how your Brexit is going to benefit anyone? solitarybeehiveSo it seems few people understand what this position means. Labour being neutral means it will not force one position or another on their MPs who will be free to campaign and vote as they see fit. Despite what most people here seem to think, the country is still split and the only way forward is to have an open and honest conversation about it. Labour is a broad church, its voters are split over this and acting like that isn’t the case is not helpful. Taking a neutral stance allows the party to debate this on its own merits (or none) and then for everyone to vote with their own conscience. It is the only party that can and has tried to actually unite the country. KingInTheNorthPissing into the wind on Brexit again Jezza. I voted for you. I support fully the economic and social approach you and McDonnell have taken. But you have to fight the enemy in front of you. And that enemy is Brexit. You missed the point and consigned us to right wing extremist hell. Thanks. SequinnerSound strategy to remain neutral at the next referendum. The great thing is that Labour doesn’t need to come off the fence to win at the next GE and gain the remain vote. All Labour needs to do is offer a second referendum in its general election manifesto with the option to remain included in it. Anyone slightly remain inclined who is thinking rationally and wants to stop Brexit, would still vote for Labour if they offered a second referendum in it’s GE manifesto, regardless of whether Labour comes out fully in support of Remain as a party.Given all the above, and given the serious damage of a split in the Labour vote by backing remain unequivocally, it’s very hard to see how Labour will suffer from continuing on with constructive ambiguity while throwing its weight behind a second referendum vacuousCorbyn is right to note that the problems faced by the UK run much deeper than Brexit which is, after all, a symptom of those problems. Having said that, any form of Brexit that removes citizenship and rights from millions of people without their consent will compound the problems we face, not cure any of them. DJT1MillionCorbyn and the Labour leadership just don’t seem to understand that until Brexit is resolved one way or another, everything else is on the back burner. They can’t simply sit this out and hope it goes away – rightly or wrongly, it’s currently the number one issue and it needs decisive leadership to get past it. Adrianh2017Corbyn is correct - not spectacular, not catchy, not quotable, just correct. The general public are being excluded from the wealth flowing to a small fraction of the population. A step change is needed to address this. So much is wrong and so much has been deliberately broken over the last 40 years that there is no guarantee a new direction exists that will lead to prosperity for all. But unless you try nothing will change. WallyGnatSpot on Jez. Britain’s problems do lie far deeper than Brexit. The disconnected mentality of people who rail against Corbyn while not comprehending why Brexit happened is incredible. They’ll vote against Labour because red Ed ate his sandwich in a funny way and because they can’t trust the government with more taxes and then blink dumbfoundedly with an uncomprehending gaze when things continue to get worse and fall apart around them. vacuousGot to be honest, not a massive Corbyn fan, but he’s right on this one. It’s not about remain vs leave, we need to reunite the country and end the austerity that got us here in the first place. saxonwhittle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bf9e4a8e68d075459ffa030bad5e3b0b2217169/0_97_3395_2038/master/3395.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33a055f1f3c10ca1f8b7c613555f9e60","title":"brexit latest news jeremy corbyn speech labour could be officially neutral in any second referendum campaign john mcdonnell suggests live news","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Jeremy Corbyn’s speech on Labour’s vision for BritainPlease get your kids vaccinated because it’s not just the right thing for them, but also of course it is the right thing for the whole population because it might not be your kid that gets it, it could be somebody else’s.That’s all from me for today.Thanks for the comments.Here is a question from below the line worth answering.Andrew, (or anyone else)...can you help explain why Corbynn wants to be a temporary time limited PM of a fragile unity govt? If Labour want to transform the economy etc, why fight so hard to lead a govt that time limited, and policy limited to one policy (delay brexit, referendum - what\u0027s on referendum paper is another Q). If there\u0027s any deviation from this policy, Govts majority will instantly go, it\u0027s leader very publically tarred with the \u0027untrustworthy\u0027 brush...why would you aspire to lead this unity Govt?Better to appear statesman like, offer it up to someone else - based on the above reason, and then take your argument for society to the country, aiming to lead for 5-10 years? So what\u0027s in it for JC and Labour just now? What am I missing?Actually, under Jeremy Corbyn’s offer to run a time-limited caretaker government, his only firm intention would be to negotiate an extension to Brexit and to then call an election. Why would he bother? I can think of plenty of reasons.1) This would be a means of stopping a no-deal Brexit, which would earn Jeremy Corbyn, and Labour, great credit amongst remainers. It would also, they would say, be the right thing for the country.2) If there is going to be an early election, there would be advantages for Corbyn to holding it with Brexit delayed - because the Tories would probably get crushed by the Brexit party.3) An incumbent PM has many advantages in an election campaign. For example, she sets the date. And she can use the platform that government provides for party advantage, even though civil service resources are not meant to be spent on party political activity. Just look at the @10DowningStreet twitter feed, which reads like a Tory account even though it is a government one.4) Being prime minister helps you look prime ministerial - which is particularly useful if, like Corbyn, you are thought not to be prime ministerial.5) Even without a government majority, there is a lot a prime minister can do through prerogative powers, and through the use of patronage.6) Prime ministers without a party majority have in the past managed to fight elections and come out with a majority (eg Wilson in 1974, Cameron in 2015).7) No politician interested in changing Britain would turn down the chance to become PM - even for a short period.Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, says that if Jeremy Corbyn really intends to do “everything necessary” to stop a no-deal Brexit, as he promised in his speech this morning, he must prove it. In a statement Brake said:Jeremy Corbyn must now deliver and prove this is not just an empty promise. If he truly wants to stop a no-deal, he must accept that he must not be prescriptive about how we ensure that happens.This is not about party leaders, but about stopping Boris Johnson from dragging us off the cliff-edge.It is clear Jeremy Corbyn cannot command a majority in the House. He must do the right thing and confirm that if he cannot, he will support someone who can.These are from the broadcaster Andrew Neil on Jeremy Corbyn’s speech.And here is an extract from a blog covering it written by the New Statesman’s Stephen Bush.If the Johnson gamble blows up in his face at an election, it will be in part be because that cultural halitosis surrounding the Tory party and poshness meant that he was unable to make significant breakthroughs in the likes of Bishop Auckland while still losing seats to the Liberal Democrats in the likes of Cheltenham.That’s why Jeremy Corbyn’s attack lines on Boris Johnson – wheeled out in his big speech today, which offered us a preview of Labour’s preferred approach to an autumn election – are worth watching. Corbyn is talking up Johnson’s membership of the elite and explicitly linking Johnson in with the Tory party and with wealth (of the nine mentions of Boris Johnson in Corbyn’s speech, all were paired with a reference to his Conservativeness and his poshness).Boris Johnson will not get the chance to meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the outgoing president of the European commission, at this weekend’s G7 summit, my colleague Jennifer Rankin reports.The EU is not a G7 country, but for some reason two of its presidents (president of the commission and president of the council - there are several others) normally attend, making it effectively a G9 meeting.Here’s an extract from Jeremy Corbyn’s speech.Boris Johnson has been in hyperactive campaign mode since becoming prime minister and some Labour figures have reportedly been complaining that Jeremy Corbyn has given him something of an easy ride. Today Corbyn responded with a lengthy and wide-ranging speech that set out the case Labour would put to the public in the general election widely expected within the next few weeks or months. You can read the full text here. It was clear and coherent, and as a round-up of Labour’s policy offer, it was fine (although the party could probably still go a lot further in terms of boiling it down to a two or three-point message that everyone would remember). Johnson makes much of his ability to project optimism, and there was some evidence in the speech of Corbyn trying to respond in kind, for example when he spoke of the possible “fantastic” future available under Labour. (See 11.36am.) But exuberance isn’t a Corbyn forte, and he was much better when he was critiquing the government. The best passage was probably the one where he described Johnson’s spending announcements as an admission that Labour has won the argument on austerity (see 11.29am), and the points he made about crime and youth services that he used to back this up (see 11.31am).But you can’t take down a government with a single speech, and so at best this was just a start. It may also have been infused with a bit of wishful thinking. Corbyn has often spoken in terms that suggest he wants to move on from Brexit and his speech contained a persuasive passage arguing that the problems facing the country go well beyond Brexit. (See 11.02am.) They do. But politicians have to campaign in the world as it is, on an agenda not always of their own choosing, and the Q\u0026ampA made it clear that the prospect of the next election not being dominated by Brexit seems remote. There is a summary of some of the main lines in the Corbyn speech here. And here is a summary of the main points from the Q\u0026ampA.I am the leader of the opposition, the leader of the Labour party. All the constitutional precedents are, when a government collapses, it’s the leader of the opposition that takes over.There seems to be an awful lot of very imaginative what iffery in the press at the present time. We will put a motion of no confidence in the government. We will do everything we can to stop a no deal Brexit.I have written to the leaders of all of the other opposition parties inviting them to join me in this and I simply say to them, and to those probably quite small number of Conservatives who are alarmed at the prospect of a no deal Brexit: “If you’re serious about stopping an no-deal Brexit, then back my motion of no confidence to stop this government taking us over a cliff edge on the 31st October.”We offer to form a minority administration in order to give the people the choice in the future through a general election. That’s what we’re saying. That is the constitutional precedent. That is the norm.All this speculation about lots of other options - they actually don’t exist. The option that exists is the constitutional precedent of the opposition taking over in order to facilitate an opportunity for an election campaign.This is slightly different from the line taken by John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, in his Today interview this morning in which he stressed that a no confidence motion was not the only means available to stop no deal. (See 9.33am.)When the UN produces a report that says millions of people in the fifth richest country in the world are living in poverty, and it’s getting worse - if that came out under Labour government, every media outlet in the land would be condemning us, and they would be right. Where’s the voice against the Tories for doing that?In an interview in Cornwall during his hospital visit, Boris Johnson also said that the EU would have to compromise for there to be a Brexit deal. Asked whether progress would be made during his talks with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron later this week, Johnson replied:Well that is, I’m afraid, very much up to our friends and I hope that they will compromise. They have seen that the UK parliament has three times rejected the withdrawal agreement, the backstop just doesn’t work, it’s not democratic and I hope that they will see fit to compromise but in the meantime we get ready to come out on October 31.Here are the main points from this morning’s Number 10 lobby briefing.In relation to business we have been engaging widely and will continue to do so and that’s been significantly stepped up in recent weeks. We have published numerous documents on how businesses can prepare. You can expect to see further information being published in the coming weeks in relation to how the public ... can further prepare and the changes that they are likely to see across a range of areas.So for example we will introduce, immediately, much tougher criminality rules for people entering the UK. Details of other changes immediately on October 31 for a new immigration system are currently being developed. The prime minister has obviously been clear that we want to introduce an Australian-style points-based immigration system.The spokeswoman said Boris Johnson and Patel would set out more details of their plans shortly.The House of Commons agreed the date it would rise for summer recess, as well as its return on September 3 and this was passed by a majority of close to 200 MPs.Boris Johnson has been speaking to broadcasters on a visit to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, where he has been promoting measures to increase the number of parents getting their children vaccinated. Here are the key points he has been making.I’m not going to suggest that there won’t be - as I said on the steps of Downing Street - there may well be bumps in the road but we will be ready to come out on October 31 deal or no deal. Now of course our friends and partners on the other side of the Channel are showing a little bit of reluctance at the moment to change their position. That’s fine - I’m confident that they will - but in the meantime we have to get ready for a no deal outcome. I want a deal. We’re ready to work with our friends and partners to get a deal but if you want a good deal for the UK, you must simultaneously get ready to come out without one.It is hard to see why Johnson is confident that the EU will back down because European leaders have been saying, almost unanimously and ad nauseam, that they are not willing to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.If you look at the preparations the UK had made by March 29, we were very far advanced and things then slipped back a bit but we’re very confident that by October 31 we will be ready and that’s the crucial thing. I think that’s what people want. People are very confident themselves that they can do it. I’m not pretending that there won’t be bumps on the road. There will be, I said that on the steps of Downing Street, but if everybody puts their minds to it I have absolutely no doubt that we can get ready.Here is the full text of Jeremy Corbyn’s speech in Corby.In his Q\u0026ampA Jeremy Corbyn would not commit to backing remain in a second referendum staged by Labour after a general election, and he would not rule out the party being neutral in such a contest. (See 11.46am and 11.55am.) But Corbyn has, of course, said that if there were a referendum now on a Tory Brexit, or on no deal, Labour would campaign for remain. I’ve amended the wording in those earlier posts because they did not make that clear. Sorry.Corbyn says zero-hours contracts represent a return to the insecure labour conditions that used to apply to people working at the docks. Labour would end zero-hours contracts, he says.In response to a question from a Labour supporter who asked what Corbyn would do about the media who tell lies, Corbyn says he is a member of the NUJ. A free press is very important, he says. But he says he wants to ensure that reporting is balanced, and that people have a right to reply. He set out plans for media reform in a speech in Edinburgh last year. Those plans would form the basis for Labour’s plans, he says.He says it is crucial that people who are attacked in the media get a right of reply.I will post a summary shortly.Corbyn says he represents a constituency where only around a third of people own their own homes. He wants more council housing, he says. He says Margaret Thatcher’s right to buy has led to a huge increase in the number of people having to rent from a private landlord.Corbyn says there has been a lot of speculation about what other mechanisms might be used to block a no-deal Brexit. But those options are not available yet, he says. The option that is available is a no confidence vote.Q: Why do you think so many Labour MPs do not see you as the right person to lead an interim government?Corbyn says he was elected Labour leader in 2015, to the surprise of the mainstream media. He was elected again in 2016. He is sure all Labour MPs want to join him in backing a no confidence motion against the government.Q: John McDonnell said this morning he would campaign for remain in a second referendum. Would you? And if not, can you see why remainers have doubts about your leadership?Corbyn says McDonnell was giving his personal view. He says the real issue is what must be done to end inequality in Britain.He says that if the UN produced a report about Britain under a Labour government as critical as the Philip Alston report was every media organisation would feature it very prominently.This gets a huge cheer from the Labour supporters in the audience.Corbyn says what happened to Northamptonshire council (it went bust) was symptomatic of how the Tories have underfunded local government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

With the pace of play in the spotlight following the antics of Bryson DeChambeau, the move means attention will also fall on what steps the PGA Tour in the US will take.Starting from late November, a player on the European Tour will incur a one-shot penalty for two bad times in a single round. Fines for those who are consistently needing to be timed – known as being “on the clock” – will be increased significantly. A player who is timed 15 times next season will be fined £26,000 compared with £9,000 now.The tour will also reduce field sizes where possible, a factor considered integral to the pace of play. Its members will be offered educational sessions as part of the detailed, four-point action plan.The tour insists this is not a reaction to DeChambeau’s slow play during the Northern Trust event in New Jersey. The world No 9’s glacial approach led to him being criticised by fellow players, including Brooks Koepka and Justin Thomas, while the PGA Tour promised to review pace-of-play guidelines.In Europe, the tour was approached by players on its tournament committee in May with a view to putting a plan in place for next season.Rory McIlroy, a European Tour member who spends the majority of his time on the PGA Tour, supports stroke penalties as the best way to counter slow play.A European Tour statement said: “When players are out of position and either being monitored or timed, a one-shot penalty will be incurred after two bad times – currently a player would be ‘monitored’ and if he breaches the time allowance (50 seconds for first to play, 40 seconds for second or third to play) he will then be ‘officially timed’ and would then have to breach twice more before being given a one-shot penalty. Players will, however, have the option to request one time extension per round, giving an additional 40 seconds to hit a shot on this request.”Referees will be told to be proactive in targeting known slow players with regards being in position to play.Keith Pelley, the chief executive of the European Tour, said: “We are already at the forefront of pace of play management in the professional game, but after being mandated by our tournament committee to be even firmer in dealing with this issue, the time was right to take these additional steps.“I believe the plan we are implementing for the 2020 season will bring about meaningful change that will make golf even more enjoyable for the players and our fans, whether they are at the course in person or watching on television.”A statement from the tour added: “All players will now be required to pass an interactive rules test as part of their conditions of membership, while new members will be allocated a dedicated referee to educate them on pace of play policies at the start of their European Tour career.”A trial of technology dedicated to pace of play will be undertaken at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth on 18-22 September. Larger gaps between start times in the third and fourth rounds of tournaments will be implemented."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8211f45e93389d96944b0d0fc1dc100965755da8/214_53_3835_2300/master/3835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efdeb3c2e2d2c2756f0930e350f75d6c","title":"jofra archer steve smith england australia the ashes fast bowler","story":"The physical threat posed by a fast bowler is a legitimate aspect of cricket and this was an elevated example of a hallowed genreWhile mulling over England’s tactics for what would go down in history as the Bodyline series, Douglas Jardine watched a newsreel of Donald Bradman, his side’s principal adversary, batting at the Oval in 1930. What particularly caught his eye was an incident in which a short ball from Harold Larwood hit the Australia hero on the chest. Examining it again and again, Jardine thought he saw Bradman flinch as the delivery bore down on him at high speed. His daughter remembered his comment. “I’ve got it – he’s yellow,” Jardine exclaimed and made his preparations accordingly.Cricket would not be the same again. Although Bradman was not the principal victim of England’s aggressive bowling in the 1932-33 series – most memorably, Bill Woodfull was hit over the heart and Bert Oldfield suffered a fractured skull from Larwood’s deliveries – the touring team won the Ashes and intimidatory bowling was established as a useful and often controversial weapon in a Test captain’s armoury.After Saturday, no one will ever accuse Steve Smith of being yellow. As Bradman’s successor made his way from the Lord’s pavilion back to the crease, having attempted to shake off the effect of a blow to his neck from Jofra Archer’s 91mph bouncer, many of those previously reluctant to applaud a player whose reputation was tainted by the sandpaper scandal could not refrain from admiring a gesture of such courage and obduracy.His duel with Archer, on which the fate of the series seemed to rest, was one to rank in English memories with Geoff Boycott versus Michael Holding in Bridgetown in 1981 or Mike Atherton fending off Allan Donald at Trent Bridge in 1998. Whether such a passage of play lasts six balls, as it did in Barbados, or just short of six hours, as in Nottingham, the atmosphere crackles with a special kind of electricity. Every watcher’s system is flooded with the adrenaline that accompanies a blend of exhilaration and fear.Smith didn’t last long after his return, although the image of the defiantly unorthodox swat for four off the second delivery he received from Chris Woakes will last almost as long in the memory as the sight of his figure lying on the ground earlier. The way he got out soon afterwards, leaving a straight ball, was a surer sign of scrambled senses than any reply he had previously given to the questions asked by his team doctor and specified in the latest iteration of the sport concussion assessment tool, starting with: “What venue is this?”Once further symptoms had become apparent the next day, there were plenty of commentators ready to insist that, given the recent emphasis throughout sport on dealing with concussion, he ought to have been prevented from resuming his innings. It was even said independent doctors should be brought in to make such assessments, insinuating team medics may be prone to setting aside their ethical judgment in the interests of a result.Sometimes, as with the Bodyline series or West Indies’ rotation of four fast bowlers in the 1980s, relentless short-pitched fast bowling threatens the spirit of the game, prompting adjustments to the laws. But the physical threat posed by an inidual fast bowler is a legitimate aspect of cricket and Archer versus Smith offered an elevated example of a hallowed genre. It was interesting that although Archer rattled a number of other batsmen’s helmets during the course of the match the presence of Smith at the other end brought him to a peak of focused aggression.By returning to the crease, Smith certainly put himself at risk of the second blow that medical opinion now sees as providing an enhanced threat to a concussed player. But he also provided us with an example of the sort of courage without which a sport such as cricket is not really worth the candle.Helmets and other forms of padding offer batsmen far more protection than their predecessors enjoyed against Larwood, Ray Lindwall or Wes Hall. Yet the challenge they face has changed very little: the ball still weighs five and a half ounces, the pitch is still 22 yards long, and fast bowlers still bowl in the same 90mph range as their distant ancestors, despite much more advanced physical conditioning. Watching Smith’s assertive reaction to Archer’s fusillade on Saturday, David Gower observed that 30 years ago the technique of evasion would have been very different time, in that sense, has tilted the odds in the batsman’s favour.Some sports will always contain an inherent danger to life and limb, and reducing the threat in line with changing attitudes to risk is inevitable. Given the increasing reluctance of parents to allow their children to play rugby union, the authorities are right to consider amendments to the rules on tackling. But even in this safety-conscious era the only way of providing a guarantee against deaths such as those of the grand prix driver Jules Bianchi, the boxer Maxim Dadashev and the cyclist Bjorg Lambrecht is to ban those sports completely – which some, no doubt, would do.The next time we see Smith make his way to the crease, he will probably be wearing the neck guards on his helmet and the forearm protector that would have reduced the damage from the two blows he suffered on Saturday. Withholding his return from Thursday’s Test at Headingley would seem, on the evidence so far, to be a wise choice. But next month at Old Trafford or the Oval the second instalment of his contest with Archer will be awaited with even keener anticipation than the first, which gave us a new page of cricket history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e16f45da0409cfa01e37dc70853442ded16a456/151_9_4143_2487/master/4143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b6d278711747677825af0df19efa025","title":"steve smith jofra archer australia england the ashes headingley","story":"Australia’s key problem heading into the third Test surrounds their best batsman while England have a new special weaponThe respite between Tests is brief but at least there is some scope for measured decisions. For Australia the key problem surrounds their best batsman, Steve Smith.During the Lord’s match there was barely any time for their backroom staff to decide whether he should resume his innings on Saturday afternoon. Citing the fact Smith was desperate to get his name on the famous honours boards in the pavilion, a tradition that feels like an ancient rite when in fact these boards are a relatively recent innovation, he was allowed to return to the crease 40 minutes after retiring hurt, though he could not score the 20 additional runs needed to prod the engravers into action.Now there will be a little more time to consider the priorities of the tour party. Number one, by a distance, is to ensure the wellbeing of every member of the team number two is to retain the Ashes. By this measure it would be remarkable if Smith was allowed to play at Headingley on Thursday, even though it is a fair assumption he will want to. Objectivity must be hard to find in these circumstances, whether assessing the opinions of the player concerned, the coaching staff or the doctor who is an employee of Cricket Australia.At Lord’s there was talk of a “McGrath moment” after Smith was forced to withdraw, a reference to the freakish accident with a stray ball in 2005 just before the start of the second Test at Edgbaston. The parallels are not that close. Fourteen years ago England won that second Test to level the series at Lord’s this week Australia retained their 1-0 lead, which means they are much better placed than Ricky Ponting’s side. They require one more victory to ensure the retention of the Ashes. They are hardly in desperate straits – in fact their situation more closely mirrors that of the 1981 tourists as they head to Headingley and miracles were required to change the course of that series.However, there has undoubtedly been a mood swing in this series and that has been triggered by the extraordinary Test debut of Jofra Archer. The numbers do not suggest anything too remarkable. In the match Archer took five for 91 from 44 overs, excellent figures but not ones that accurately reflect the impact he has had on both sides.Joe Root now recognises he suddenly has a special weapon. His next step is to work out how to use it judiciously. Meanwhile Australia are aware of a major new challenge ahead.In the 21st century the fear factor has diminished. The advent of ever more sophisticated helmets, chest protectors and arm guards has helped, although one consequence of helmets is that batsmen get hit on the head far more frequently.County cricketers of the 70s and 80s would peruse the fixture list carefully to check when they were scheduled to come up against Michael Holding, Colin Croft, Sylvester Clarke, Imran Khan, Malcolm Marshall or Joel Garner. One or two might even plan their hamstring injuries accordingly – there were no tell-tale scanning machines around then. In pre-helmet days there was real anxiety that could easily tipple over to raw fear within the dressing room.Fear has not felt like such a factor in recent times – perhaps that is partly because your correspondent has been reclining in the safety of a press box. But it is still possible to spot that frisson when it becomes apparent batsmen are arriving at the crease fearful of being hit by a cricket ball travelling in excess of 90 mph. The best can be “petrified” and that was the case in Australia in 2013-14 when Mitchell Johnson was at full throttle.In his autobiography Kevin Pietersen admits to that feeling when waiting to bat. “A shudder ran through the dressing room,” he writes after a Johnson bouncer had smashed into the gloves of Jonathan Trott in Brisbane. “You very seldom hear people in your own team saying they are physically scared but our tail-end batsmen were scared.”At Lord’s we had no way of knowing how the Australia dressing room reacted to the bowling of Archer on a slow pitch but it can be guaranteed this would have become a topic of animated conversation, especially after Smith and Marnus Labuschagne had been hit. In his first Test Archer created the same frisson as Johnson managed throughout an entire series six years ago.Everyone now knows Archer hits batsmen frequently, 19 times in a brief international career that started in May. Opponents are still coming to terms with him as he appears to generate pace from nowhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d0ed272c62bfe94b1af67420a27f23e347f4d00/0_99_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b71653a7354bc88ae61210fdb66df4f4","title":"talking horses nick rust ridiculed claim 98 percent under 30s have never seen horse","story":"Talking Horses Nick Rust has been unable to identify the source of his data, highlighting the need for care with statisticsWhen the alleged stat was posted on Twitter, Rust was roundly mocked for it. I asked the BHA’s press office if they could substantiate the stat and was told they could not immediately say which survey it came from. I believe that Rust heard it from someone in the industry some time ago.Rust was answering an audience question and therefore talking without a script. I give him credit for being there at all, as not every person in his position would be interested in attending the AGM of the National Association of Racing Staff.All of which suggests that, in the absence of further evidence, Rust’s stat is probably not accurate. And it matters because, while I admire Rust’s willingness to express a view, a chief executive should not be trying to back up his views with dodgy stats in a situation where he knows he will be quoted.Clearly a stat like the one he cited has the capacity to undermine racing, since it tends to suggest the wider public are not engaged with horsey sports. Rust cites it because he thinks the whip rules need to change to reflect the views of a wider society with no connection to the game, but if he is going to make that case stick, he had better get some believable insights into what those views are.I’m afraid this stat is no more convincing than his argument on Racing TV in the spring that we should all be worried because, as he said at the time: “There are offices in London now which don’t have milk in the office fridges. They don’t have it because milk is bad. Milk leads to cows being forced to be milked and more methane in society. The world is changing.”Racing’s chief executive needs to be a lot more careful about the evidence he adduces to support his arguments.Paul Mulrennan has lost the ride on Mabs Cross, third-favourite for the Nunthorpe Stakes at York on Friday. The veteran jockey has been the default rider for the high-achieving mare this season and last and has done well, partnering her to six successes, but her owner, David Armstrong, wanted a change.She will instead be ridden by Gerald Mosse, who came in for the winning ride aboard Mabs Cross in the Prix de l’Abbaye last autumn, Mulrennan having been sidelined with a broken back at the time. Armstrong evidently wants the Frenchman to ride her in the Abbaye again and has therefore asked for him to take the mount this time, in what is likely to be her final outing before Paris.“David has a lot of horses,” said Michael Dods, trainer of Mabs Cross. “He’s obviously got one eye on France and was keen for Gerald to ride her there. I’ve got no issue with Paul, he’ll still be riding a lot for me this week. He’s done nothing wrong on her and there’s nothing to say he won’t get back on her at some stage.”Mabs Cross was beaten a nose in last year’s Nunthorpe at odds of 14-1. She is no bigger than 9-2 this time but will face the classy pair of Ten Sovereigns and Battaash. “You’ve only got to look at those two to know it won’t be easy,” Dods continued. “But she’s in great form and she’s in with a shout. She’s moving well and eating well.”Mulrennan broke the news through his Racing TV blog, in which he made no complaint. “Her owners have obviously decided to take me off, but they are entitled to their choice and I’m not the first jockey in the world – and I won’t be the last either – to lose a big ride like this,” he said.“I’ve ridden 34 winners already this year and will be doing my best to improve that figure as much as possible, buoyed on by all the support I enjoy from Mr Dods and all of the other yards and owners I ride regularly for.”Japan and Circus Maximus will represent Aidan O’Brien in the Juddmonte International, the big race on day one of York’s Ebor meeting, which starts on Wednesday. The Irishman took out his Derby winner, Anthony Van Dyck, at the final declaration stage, when Enable and Magical were also withdrawn. Japan, to be ridden by Ryan Moore, is 11-2 third-favourite behind Crystal Ocean and King Of Comedy.I haven’t enjoyed my recent engagements with Catterick handicaps but there’s a handful of horses that catch my eye at the Scotch Corner track today. Night Law (3.00) is especially interesting at 7-1, having bounced back to winning form over this course and distance a fortnight ago, when blinkers were fitted for the first time.Yonks ago, this mare won a Sandown maiden for Andrew Balding. She lost her way handicapping for Richard Fahey the next year but she was racing off marks in the 70s. After two seasons in Ireland with low-profile trainers, she had crashed down to 46 before scoring on her third start for Katie Scott. Now up 5lb to a rating of 51, she is probably still well treated.Good Night Mr Tom (2.30) looks fairly priced at 6-4 to follow up his nursery success, his first run since being gelded, while the 15-2 shot Tapis Libre (5.35) has come down to an attractive mark and has a visor on for only the second time.Pick of the Windsor card tonight could be Perfect Refuge (7.00), a Clive Cox filly who was arguably unlucky when beaten here a fortnight ago and now has a weight pull with the winner. She’s 11-2."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe63dbd941def22fba828a3bc0680fb60fff5d53/785_465_4702_2821/master/4702.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d304b58870b2fd56439dd976d8996c74","title":"game of thrones daniel portman podrick edinburgh fringe","story":"Renowned as the squire and surprise Casanova in Thrones, the star is now wrestling with audiences in Edinburgh. He talks about his meteoric rise to fame and why he won’t be going back to schoolDaniel Portman is soaked in sweat and locked in battle. There is an epic swell of music as he lunges at his opponent. But we’re not in Westeros, where Portman became a Game of Thrones fan favourite as steadfast squire Podrick Payne. He is centre-stage at the Edinburgh fringe, in a red unitard, arm-wrestling an audience member. Portman goes over the top, the crowd cheers and he laps up the applause.This is Square Go, a late-night rumble of a show in which he plays 13-year-old Glaswegian daydreamer Max, hiding in the school toilets with his mate Stevie, awaiting a fight with a bully. When we meet in an Edinburgh pub, I ask Portman if he always wins the arm wrestles. “Generally, yeah,” he says instantly, with easy confidence, in a voice as deep as his eyes are brown. Occasionally, some “big macho bloke” gets carried away, in which case Portman will remind him: “You’re fighting a 13-year-old boy who’s doing this in his fantasy world. So I’m gonna cheat to win.” He smiles. “Some people take it really seriously.”This is what the show is about: how boys hide behind bravado right through adulthood. But there’s no lecturing or hand-wringing. At the start, Portman strides in like a wrestling pro, getting the audience to feel the steel and chant his character’s name. Max is psyching himself up for his “square go” – Glaswegian slang for a fight – but soon crashes back to reality. “You’re gonnae get pure tabernacled,” Stevie reminds him.A high-octane hour, Square Go is performed in the round. “It’s exhausting,” says Portman. “The energy is like a vortex.” He’s superb in the play – as is Gavin Jon Wright as Stevie. It’s clearly a hoot to perform. Portman and Wright, who were in Black Watch together a few years back, have nailed the comic timing of the “your maw” gags and putdowns that come thick and fast in Kieran Hurley and Gary McNair’s script. In this very physical role, Portman proves a nimble comedian, trembling as he bobs and weaves. He is slammed to the floor repeatedly by Wright and mercilessly whacked with a blow-up wrestling doll.Everything is OTT, including a thumb war staged like an arena-sized showdown. “When you’re that age, your universe is school,” says Portman. “It is funny that it’s so grand and operatic in scale but it’s nuclear to these guys. This is the end of the world. The way these characters in Max’s mind are portrayed is slightly ridiculous – the luchador mask, inflatables, a guy with a big foam finger – but at that age you feel everything more.”Portman grew up in Glasgow and had “a leftwing upbringing, open-minded and fair”. His dad is the actor Ron Donachie, his mum a complementary therapist. Could he relate to Max? “I never felt any pressure at home but outside the house I did feel pressure to be tough. The only acceptable emotion outside the house was anger, if there was anything. Sadness wasn’t allowed.” He says he was arrogant: “I was naturally quite big and athletic and I certainly imposed myself on people.” It was through insecurity, he acknowledges, but then borrows a line from the play: “Every dick’s got a reason for being a dick – it doesn’t change the fact I was a dick.”What was Portman up to at Max’s age? “Kicking a football around, having a pretty good time of it.” Did he have his own square go? “I got into quite a few scrapes when I was young. They always made me very sad.” In hindsight, he says, he’s sort of glad. “Some men, if they haven’t had that experience, they maybe carry it into adulthood. They still feel like they have something to prove. I don’t have that.” By the end of Square Go, the venue becomes stifling and reminds Portman of school fights: “If something was going to kick off it got hot. You could smell it.”The end of Portman’s school experience was soured by “some very nasty rumours spread about me by a couple of guys who were very close to my heart”. He says he ended up with almost no friends. Part of the problem was that he’d embarked on an acting career. “It makes people uncomfortable. They go, ‘Do something real.’” Apparently, this extended to the staff, with the exception of his drama teacher. “The same teachers who told me not to do it have asked me to go back and talk to pupils about how much the school gave me. Go fuck yourself. There’s no chance. If I do come in, I’ll say, ‘Don’t listen to these people.’”This is his first summer performing at the fringe, and Portman feels as if he’s cheating because his show is selling out and he doesn’t have to flyer it. He remembers travelling from Glasgow when he was younger and watching free shows back-to-back all day. He’d grown up seeing his dad on telly – Casualty one night, The Bill the next – and the big screen, notably as the master-at-arms in James Cameron’s Titanic. Donachie even went on to have a small role in Thrones, as Ser Rodrik Cassel.Portman made his acting debut with a youth theatre group – playing Moonface, a gangster disguised as a priest – in the Cole Porter musical Anything Goes. Looking at him today, dressed in black with an open face that seems both solemn and saintly, yet has the widest smile, the casting still makes sense.That production’s boozy last-night celebrations had disastrous results. “I gave my then girlfriend my jacket. By the time we got to the after party I was fucked. I woke up the next day and had pneumonia. I was out of action for a month.” On his first day back to school, there happened to be a casting session for a Scottish horror film Outcast, starring James Nesbitt. Portman auditioned on his 17th birthday and got a walk-on part.What happened next? A bit of theatre at the Òran Mór in Glasgow, the BBC Scotland soap River City and “then Game of Thrones came up”. The biggest show on the planet appears in conversation as casually as it pops up on Portman’s sparse IMDb page. Was he intimidated, arriving on set? Nervous, yes, he answers. “But not overwhelmed.”Was he daunted by the now famous orgy scene, where Podrick gives a group of prostitutes such pleasure that they refund his payment? “When you’re 20 and on a big TV show and the writers tell you your character is about to become the greatest lover in the world” – he pauses – “you tell me how you’d feel!” The scene led to some “interesting journeys” he laughs. The reports earlier this year about him being groped by fans at conventions were blown out of proportion he says, but adds: “It has happened a few times, with men and women doing it. It has given me a bit of an insight into what women have to deal with sometimes and it’s very, very unpleasant.”Portman first auditioned for two characters who were bumped off in season two. The producers invited him to audition instead for Podrick, who survived to season eight. After the series wrapped, he was told Podrick was meant to be in just two or three episodes but they “liked having him around”.Podrick is a loyal servant of Brienne of Tarth, the resolute warrior played by Gwendoline Christie. She tells me Portman has “a wonderful capacity for enjoying the absurd”, which was useful during “long days swathed in mud or submerged in water wearing leather and metal clothes”. Does she think Portman has anything in common with Podrick? “A mellifluous singing voice,” she responds, “and impossibly jutting cheekbones.”Portman auditioned in his own voice and in received pronunciation, and the Thrones producers chose RP for Podrick. “There weren’t any Scottish accents in the show,” he says. “I don’t really know why not. Maybe they were worried people in the States wouldn’t understand.” The majority of his encounters with fans are friendly but “people do take the piss sometimes and think they can push me around. They expect to get Podrick Payne. They expect this shy, timid, little English boy. That’s not what they get.”Portman’s next stage role is in The Last King of Scotland, an adaptation of Giles Foden’s novel, in which he will play the medic who becomes personal physician to Idi Amin. It opens in Sheffield in September. For now he is clearly over the moon to be in Edinburgh. His Thrones pal Joe Dempsie and he were having a few drinks the other day and were handed flyers for Thrones! The Musical Parody. “They say they ‘fix the final season’,” he observes. He’s planning to pop along. “I just hope they don’t try and drag me on stage.” Meanwhile, he’s looking forward to his family seeing Square Go. He cracks a mischievous smile. “I’ll see if I can get my old man up for the arm wrestle.”• Square Go is at the Roundabout, Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/436a20f73b1817f3a198307463df7004d0d17537/458_802_1780_1068/master/1780.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efbaeba83d22afd272af82d327a00ab5","title":"jack tucker review underbelly cowgate edinburgh festival 2019","story":"Underbelly Cowgate, EdinburghSounds and samples are tailored to the hack comic’s every comment, punchline and flirtatious wink in this fun character showThe hack comic is such a mainstay of drama and caricature – from Osborne’s Entertainer via Neil Hamburger to Zoe Coombs Marr’s Dave – the concept is practically hack itself. You need something to distinguish yourself from the herd, and Zach Zucker (of clown duo Zach and Viggo) certainly has with this new show in character as a washed-up American standup, Jack Tucker. The something in question is director and sound-effects operator Jonny Woolley, effectively the other half of an on stageoff stage double act.Way beyond the boom-tish you might expect, there is a range of sounds and samples tailored to Tucker’s every comment, punchline and flirtatious wink. A burst of bagpipes greets each mention of Edinburgh at every callback, a phone rings there’s a blast of Lenny Kravitz’s American Woman when Tucker thinks he has struck comedy gold, at which points his red-ringed eyes light up and he swells with pride. Maybe the big time is not beyond him, after all?It is. Because – shabby of suit, flies gaping, more rumpled than a doss-house duvet – Tucker is a never-was struggling to upgrade to a has-been. He offers us lukewarm takes on Trump, smartphones, and the clitoris – one among many words (and names, and places) he struggles to pronounce. There are sob stories about his recent orce, switching on a dime with priapic “I was fucking my wife the other day” standup.The point isn’t to play the reality of a Tucker gig. As the ever-changing age of his son (from infant to pensioner and back) implies, we’re taking a trip into the recesses of a glitching mind, where comedy’s dwindling endorphin rush struggles to keep desolation at bay. The show flits between the standup and melancholy reveries (dry ice, sad piano) triggered by whatever heckles or walkouts come Zucker’s way. It has little new to say about hack comics and (what’s always assumed to be) their bleak lives. But when Zucker and Woolley improvise together, pinging set-ups and sound stings back and forth while their late-night crowd goes wild, it’s more than fun enough to compensate.• Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fda8f978a367ae830e3bfd4f3007f9bfab4a079/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b037da95f96156413d655c1fab4182b 660w","title":"twitter china hong kong accounts","story":"Company also suspends thousands of accounts as it reports ‘state-backed information operation’Twitter has removed nearly 1,000 accounts and suspended thousands of others tied to a campaign by the Chinese government against protesters in Hong Kong, the company announced on Monday.The social media giant disclosed a “significant state-backed information operation” originating from within the People’s Republic of China (PRC) targeting the pro-democracy movement in the Chinese territory.

You have to commit. You have to give yourself to the river and let it be your guide.I tested out my technique – and bravado – when I visited Basel during Europe’s recent heatwave, when temperatures in the city reached 38C. Fortunately for me, the Swiss have led the way in city swimming: for decades, cities such as Basel, Berne, Zurich and Geneva have been making rivers accessible and safe for swimmers. Developments in the 1980s included building sewage treatment facilities and erting domestic wastewater away from the river, and concrete steps were built for easier access to the water, and guidelines and maps published for swimmers.The Rhine sweeps through the medieval city and is an important trading route. Large flat-bottomed barges share the water with swimmers. Despite the shipping monsters and urban riverbanks, the water isn’t rife with litter or pollution. In fact, it reminded me of moonstone, a pearlescent blend of blues and greens, surprisingly clear. It is fast-flowing and constantly swirling, eddies forming around bridge pillars.I entered the water from the popular swimming beach of Einstieg Rhyschwimme at the foot of art-packed Museum Tinguely. Most people swim between the Schwarzwald and Johanniter bridges and let the current take them downstream. A sign displays a swimmer’s map, developed in 1984, marking the safe swimming area. There is a makeshift changing room and a couple of toilets, but that’s it. No lifeguards. Swimmers enter the water at their own risk.I put all my belongings, including my purse, phone and passport, into a Wickelfisch. These brightly coloured fish-shaped bags, sold all over the city keep clothes and possessions dry for the duration of a trip down the Rhine. I watched other swimmers entering the water: office workers folded suits and loaded Wickelfisch confidently with laptops tourists fumbled and followed, as did I.The fast flow swept me downstream. This isn’t for nervous swimmers: you are immediately out of your depth as you enter the strong stream and water aids are prohibited. I’m an experienced swimmer and the current still unnerved me: my instinct was to swim, kick and control, but relaxing into the flow was the best way.There is plenty of room, with large red buoys marking the swimming area off from that used by boats. The adventure is just over 2km of downstream floating and I had a stupid grin on my face the whole way. Floating down a fast-flowing city centre river goes against all the “rules” we like to outline to swimmers in the UK: like knowing your exit point, and urban areas being often unclean, unsafe. But this was the perfect way to see the sights.I passed the first of four historic ferry boats that take passengers across the river powered solely by the current. Basel is famous for its blend of historic buildings, such as the Basler Münster (cathedral) and contemporary museums, apartments and commercial buildings. From the water you get a great view of how the city has developed. I swooshed through the arches of Mittlere Brücke, built in 1226 and in no time at all found myself in the midst of the city, looking at riverbanks draped with sunbathers.Concrete steps at the water’s edge offered swimmers a number of exit opportunities. I set my eyes on orange and green parasols surrounding a popular buvette – an outdoor bar that only operates in summer months. Exiting the water was almost as unsettling as getting in, though. I narrowly missed a string of wooden boats before planting my feet. The whole trip took about 30 minutes and all I wanted to do after was walk back upstream and do it all over again.Later in the week I joined Selina Speck from the SLRG (Swiss Life Saving Society) for another dip in the Rhine. Selina told me it is rare that people get in trouble, and if they do it is often because they misjudge their own swimming ability. We took the same route together, only this time we walked back upstream afterwards, drank iced tea from buvettes and ate ice-cream on the warm slabs of concrete that dried our bodies before we plunged back in.Selina explained that the current is usually faster and water level higher than in this hot summer week, so what I had experienced was tame. I spent the afternoon with Selina both of us just in swimwear, not thinking twice about the fact we were walking around the city clad like this. Along the embankment on the Kleinbasel side of the river there are plenty of places to get into and out of the water.Swimming in the Rhine feels like you are in the soul of the city but Basel has plenty else on offer. Its history is fascinating and I found myself walking the same steps with new eyes after an hour’s walking tour with a guide uncovering secrets of the city. I discovered that bathing in Basel isn’t just reserved for the Rhine more than 200 historic fountains across the city are also popular for cooling off in.The Swim City exhibition at the Swiss Architecture Museum until 29 September is a celebration of bathing culture in cities across the world and a look at how swimming in cities could look in the future. Exhibits include the Thames Bath: a floating river pool on the river in central London and +POOL – a development that would allow New Yorkers to swim in the Hudson River.If the sweeping river current isn’t for you, river culture can be soaked up in one of two bathing houses that sit on stilts on the riverbank. Constructed in 1898, the large metal-and-wooden structures offer sunloungers, parasols, changing facilities, and steps down to less-lively water under the stilts for around £5 a day. The Rheinbad Breite bathing house sits opposite the swimmers’ beach on the south bank.

The incident was captured on cellphone video that showed Garner shouting “I can’t breathe” 11 times.His final words became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement that protested around the US in the wake of Garner’s death and the death of black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri a month later.O’Neill, who served as a uniformed officer in the department for more than three decades, said he had watched the video of Garner’s death a number of times and questioned how he would have behaved if he had been the responding officer. He criticized Garner’s decision to resist arrest as well as Pantaleo’s decision to use the banned chokehold.“Every time I watch that video I say to myself, as probably all of you do, to Mr Garner, ‘Don’t do it, comply.’ Officer Pantaleo: ‘Don’t do it.’ I say that about the decisions made by both officer Pantaleo and Mr Garner. But none of us can take back our decisions, most especially when they lead to the death of another human being.”Last month, the US justice department declined to indict Pantaleo on federal civil rights charges, meaning the former officer will face no criminal proceedings.In 2015 the Garner family settled a civil lawsuit with the city for $5.9m after a grand jury on Staten Island declined to bring criminal charges.Family members have long been frustrated at the slowness of the internal NYPD process. Pantaleo remained employed, earning more than $100,000 a year.Speaking after the decision, Emerald Snipes-Garner, Garner\u0027s daughter, said the family would now pursue statewide legislation to make police chokeholds illegal, and would pursue a congressional investigation into why the US justice department did not pursue civil rights charges. “For Commissioner O’Neill, I thank you for doing the right thing,” Snipes-Garner said. “I truly, and sincerely thank you for firing the officer. Regardless of how you came to your decision, you finally made a decision that should have been made five years ago.”“And the tragic reality is that neither a verdict from a judge nor a decision by a police commissioner can reverse what happened on 17 July 2014. Officer Daniel Pantaleo’s termination from the New York City police department does not make the death of Eric Garner any less harrowing. But it is heartening to know that some element of justice has been served.“Given the evidence the CCRB’s prosecutors presented at trial, the police commissioner had no option but to dismiss Pantaleo from the department. While 17 July is and always will be a somber day for the city of New York, today we can rest assured that Daniel Pantaleo will never patrol our streets again.”O’Neill’s decision instantly ignited further tension between the city’s powerful police unions, which have lobbied for Pantaleo, and the city’s executive, including New York City’s mayor, Bill de Blasio.Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, said in a statement O’Neill had “chosen politics and his own self-interest over the police officers he claims to lead”.Lynch advised his 23,000 NYPD members to “proceed with the utmost caution in this new reality, in which they may be deemed ‘reckless’ just for doing their job”.Although de Blasio has never publicly called for Pantaleo to lose his job the mayor, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, told a debate last month he wanted justice to be served.O’Neill said his decision to fire the officer had been based on the recommendations from the trial, and not pressure from City Hall.

The pair were about to board a ferry for Toulon, in southern France, from Porto Torres.They told police they took the sand as a souvenir and did not realise they had committed an offence.But they now face between one and six years in prison as Sardinian authorities get tough on an issue that has blighted the island for years.Police said there had been a “boom” this summer in the quantity of sand, shells and other beach objects found in people’s luggage at the island’s airports, with 10 tonnes seized at Olbia, close to the Costa Smeralda, in recent weeks alone.People also risk fines of up to €3,000 (£2,700), but police struggle to apply the penalties due to most culprits being visitors.“When those responsible for these episodes are foreigners, it is difficult to collect the fines,” Antonio Casula, the chief of Sardinia’s forest rangers, told La Stampa, adding that the incidents were becoming more frequent.Vigilantes patrol the beaches and signposts clearly warn it is forbidden to take sand. But unaware of the seriousness of the offence, many tourists find the sand an irresistible keepsake.The sand is usually placed in plastic bottles or bags and labelled with the name of the beach from which it was taken. Although the practice is seemingly harmless, it is not only an offence but is detrimental to the island’s environment.Some sand thieves do repent, however. A man from Rome recently returned a bottle of sand he had stolen as a child to the mayor of Cabras.In 2016, a woman who took sand from Budelli, an island off Sardinia that is famous for its pink sand beach, returned it after 29 years.The woman sent the sand back with an apology, writing: “I read in some newspapers and heard on the TV what this sand is and how it is made. I understood how unique Sardinia is. I felt guilty.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99bc6d6790724eededfbc07175e5319f2453bdc5/0_0_4166_2500/master/4166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=317743dca258dbf4e54328c0b28c3eb8","title":"kashmir parents defy authorities to keep children out of school","story":"Many fear further unrest after violent clashes between Indian police and protestersClassrooms in Indian-administered Kashmir were mostly empty on Monday, despite a government notice that schools would re-open, as tensions remained high across the territory.Many parents in Srinagar, Kashmir’s main city, kept their children at home, fearing further unrest after violent clashes over the weekend between Indian troops and protesters opposed to Delhi’s revocation of the region’s special status.Mobile and internet services remained blocked after an unprecedented lockdown imposed hours before the Indian government announcement was made two weeks ago. At least 4,000 people have reportedly been arrested under controversial public safety laws, and residents have faced near-constant curfew rules, apparently to prevent unrest.Jammu and Kashmir’s chief secretary, BVR Subrahmanyam, said on Friday that life would return to normal over the weekend, with movement restrictions lifted in many areas, landlines reinstated and some schools reopening.The region in the foothills of the Himalayas has been under dispute since\u0026nbspIndia\u0026nbspand Pakistan came into being in 1947.Both claim it in full, but each controls a section of the territory, separated by one of the world\u0027s most heavily militarised borders: the ‘line of control’ based on a ceasefire border established after a 1947-48 war. China controls another part in the east.India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous ‘princely states’ across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.Kashmir’s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, has been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.\u0026nbspAn additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.On Monday 5 August 2019, the government issued a presidential order to abolish Kashmir’s special status. The government argued that the provision was only intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan – which quickly called India’s actions illegal – and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with\u0026nbspextreme force\u0026nbspin 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.For Indians, control of Kashmir – part of the country’s only Muslim-majority state – has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. Michael Safi and Rebecca RatcliffeOn Monday, very few pupils arrived at any of the 190 schools that had opened in Srinagar. “It is a risk. I cannot risk my child’s life for some experiment,” a local police officer said.Communication blocks mean there is no way of contacting school staff in case of an emergency, he said. “There has been a gradual increase in anger and protests over the last three days so one cannot say what will happen next. The situation will not implode but there are chances that protests will grow.”A senior government official said the number of civil servants returning to work was picking up rapidly, but that school attendance was “thin to nil”.There had been minor incidents of stone throwing on Monday that were dealt with in accordance with the law, the official said.One man died and at least two dozen people were injured during clashes on Saturday night, when Indian troops reportedly used teargas, chilli grenades and pellets to disperse protesters.Sporadic protests continued on Monday, but were quickly dispersed. The severing of communications has prevented protesters from organising.In Srinagar’s Batamaloo neighbourhood, a group of demonstrators smashed the car windows of government employees who had been ordered to report to duty. Some staff were bussed to the headquarters of the Jammu and Kashmir administration, where work resumed on Monday.“It is wrong. The employees should not have come to work,” said a shopkeeper, who had opened a narrow gap in their shutter. “In 2016 we had an option to turn back, but this time there is no option,” he said, referring to the last major agitation in Kashmir which lasted nearly six month.Movement restrictions were eased in Srinagar, but most shops and private offices remained closed.A group of protesters in the western neighbourhood of Bemina blocked the main road and broke car windows. A bystander who witnessed the clash said he hoped for more protests. “It is our only chance. There will be nothing left after this,” he said.The Indian government’s decision to revoke Kashmir’s special status means the territory loses its autonomy, constitution and flag. Rules preventing outsiders from buying land in the territory, which are seen by many Kashmiris as crucial to protecting their way of life in India’s only Muslim-majority state, have also been scrapped.Authorities have reportedly detained at least 4,000 people since Delhi’s announcement. Arrests have made under the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act 1978, which allows people to be imprisoned for up to two years without charge or trial, government sources told Agence France-Presse. A government spokesperson said the number of detentions had been exaggerated, but did not provide a figure of their own.Adil Ahmad, who lives in Srinagar, said his cousin had been detained after police officers talked to him about the protests. “He was on the road when two plainclothes men came to him and started to talk to him. They asked him if there were protests in the area and he told them there should be protests. So they caught him and made a wireless message. After some time a police vehicle came and took him away,” he said.Those arrested include prominent politicians, activists, business leaders and lawyers. Many have reportedly been flown out of Kashmir to prison.Delhi’s decision has escalated tensions with Pakistan, which also claims Kashmir and has fought two wars with India over the territory. Islamabad said Indian fire across their de-facto border on Sunday had killed two civilians and seriously injured a child, a day after Delhi said Pakistani fire had killed an Indian soldier.Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan, threatened last week to “teach Delhi a lesson” and vowed to fight until the end against any Indian violations in disputed Kashmir."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3974271.1564670356!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"in the market for a low price high spec used car buy before brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA motorist who is looking to spend more than €20,000 will make the biggest savings.

As a cyclist I don’t even use the damned thing except for parental visits, where Irish transport systems are all based on a Dublin-centric system, which is useless if you’re travelling from the south to the west.”The mail went on to say that although he accepted that it was “probably worse for younger motorists” it was still “absolutely exorbitant” and he would be shopping around.We offered to find out more at that point, but he said he would do his own research and get back to us. And so he did.A couple of weeks passed and Piaras send us another mail. “I consulted a lot of friends via Facebook and took advice,” the mail began. All those who he consulted felt the increase that the AA was trying to impose was “outrageous”.“Today I went online again, to AA, and got a quotation – of €523.88, compared to their renewal notice of €855 – a decrease of 39 per cent on the first quote and actually lower than last year. Since the quotation was for Aviva, I then went directly to Aviva online and got a quotation from them for €433! I accept that the nature and extent of the cover offered is not identical but it’s still comprehensive cover.”He says the whole incident “has completely destroyed any trust I had in AA as a broker”.Detailed responseWe got in touch with the company to see what it had to say. AA spokesman Barry Aldworth sent us a very detailed response.“Having looked into this there are a few differences between the two quotes, which I feel need to be outlined and help explain the difference between the two prices,” he said. “To start with, the renewal quote of €855.41 (I’ll call this Quote A) is based on a Standard AA Car Insurance policy whereas the online quote (Quote B) of €523.88 was for a Value AA Car Insurance policy which offers a lower price point but a lesser level of cover than our standard policy would.”He said that on Quote A, “the customer would have received full no-claims discount protection as part of his cover. However, Quote B included no such protection. Also, when completing Quote B online, the customer advised that they had a no-claims history of nine years, whereas Quote A was based on a no-claims history of five years based on the information we had about this customer when generating their renewal quote.”He said the Quote B price of €523.88 also listed that the customer’s household had access to a second car, where Quote A did not. “It’s something which some people do not realise, but when getting a quote, if you have a second car in the household, advising of this can help lower your quote.“Finally, Quote A for €855.41 was generated on the basis of an annual mileage of 11,999km. However, in Quote B the customer stated that their mileage was significantly lower at 6,214km per annum. This lower mileage would also have contributed to the difference between the two quotes.”He says that our reader acknowledges there is a difference in the level of cover provided “and this would be reflected in his quote”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3990086.1566210008!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"student who came to ireland from syria with little english gets 602 leaving cert points","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNour Aljarad, who was granted asylum in Ireland in 2015 with her family, has secured a place to study dentistry at Trinity College in September. A 17-year-old student who arrived in Ireland from Syria four years ago with only basic English skills has scored more than 600 points in her Leaving Cert.Nour Aljarad, who was granted asylum in Ireland in 2015 with her family, has secured a place to study dentistry at Trinity College in September.Ms Aljarad has always been interested in dentistry, however, she says it was the “artistic side” of the profession that led her to select it as her first choice on the CAO form.“I always like makeup and I saw dentistry as a form of art. It fascinated me how a person’s smile can boost their confidence. I have friends with braces who talk about how excited they are to smile when they come off.”Her love of science also played a role in the decision. “I’ve loved science since day one. I had amazing teachers who talked about science so passionately, it was impossible not to like it with them around.”Last week, on August 13th, Ms Aljarad and her parents drove the short distance from their Stillorgan home in Dublin to St Raphaela’s secondary school to collect her results. After months of stress, exhaustion and tears Ms Aljarad was still deeply unsure whether she had achieved the high points necessary to secure a place at Trinity College. “I thought there was no way I could get 590. I knew the points were crazy for dentistry.” She was totally shocked to discover that she had, in fact, scored 602 points with H1s in five of her subjects - chemistry, physics, biology, Arabic and Japanese, which she started learning two years ago.‘Over the moon’“When I first got the envelope I kept it for myself, I didn’t want anyone else to look at it. But then I saw all the H1s and thought this is amazing. I was jumping for like an hour, I was over the moon. My mum is still jumping!”Ms Aljarad was 12 years old when she, her parents and two older sisters left Damascus. The family spent their first few months in Ireland at the Ballyhaunis direct provision centre in Co Mayo before moving to Dundalk. During this time Ms Aljarad and her sisters attended two different schools.In November 2015, the family’s story appeared in the  New to the Parish series where they spoke about their struggle to find a house in Ireland. Shortly after the article appeared, a member of the Stillorgan-Kilmacud parish came forward with an offer that the community pay housing and education bills for the family for two years. Convincing a landlord to rent a home to the Syrian family was difficult but eventually, in spring 2016, the family unpacked their bags.“Every time we started to settle we had to move to another place,” remembers Ms Aljarad. “But then we finally went to St Raphaela’s. It probably took all of second and half of third year to have the confidence to speak English. But as I found friends I was comfortable to be around my language got better and I become more familiar with the system. Plus, people were so nice to us.”Without the support of the Kilmacud community, Nour doubts she would be in the position she is today, about to embark on her university studies in Dublin. “They definitely made things easier for us and helped my family a lot. They made them stronger and provided support. I know without them we definitely wouldn’t be here today. They’re still a huge help and a big part of our life. They made me feel stronger, made my family feel welcome and less homesick than we would have been.”The family has applied for Irish citizenship and is waiting anxiously for news on their application. Ms Alhjarad still misses home and often reflects on the friends and family she left behind. “I’m not going to lie, I do get homesick. But Ireland definitely feels like home now. I don’t say I’m 100 per cent Syrian anymore, I’m half Irish now.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Saving will be ploughed back into provision of day training places, says Simon HarrisComments come after Co Kerry parish left without resident priest for the first timeRathmines-made solar telescope among items on display in Above and Beyond showMinister acknowledges need for resources to support growing numbers living after cancerConor Dillon says Government decision is \u0026lsquodiscriminating\u0026rsquo against himOfficers narrowly avoided injury at scene of suspected dissident incident in Wattle BridgeSchools are to be built by September 2020 in Dublin, Kildare, Meath and WicklowFF councillor made comments on Liveline, described incident as health and safety riskAnother man being treated in hospital under garda supervision after incident in VirginiaCourt heard woman has already been sent to prison for publishing material onlineWestern Building Systems to build \u0026euro9.5m 60-bed block at University Hospital LimerickMinister for Education has told officials to spend additional funds to alleviate problemsFive-year-old from Co Cork drowned in a lake while on a family holiday in GermanyMove comes after 300 homeowners were told the scheme had run out of moneyThousands of applicants refused for not providing documents by required dateSuspected arson attack on old Sunbeam building on northside of cityShauna Keogh: \u0026lsquoTelling other people\u0026rsquos stories can help you understand your own\u0026rsquoAmending existing PSC legislation is \u0026lsquoa simplistic approach,\u0026rsquo says Willie O\u0026rsquoDeaService allows customers to discreetly alert manned security centre through text"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3990868.1566235008!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"school building firm being sued by department wins hse contract","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWestern Building Systems has won a contract to build a  a 60 bed ward block at University Hospital Limerick. Photograph: iStock Western Building Systems, the Co Tyrone company being sued by the Department of Education over structural defects at 42 schools, has been awarded a €14 million contract by the Health Service Executive (HSE). The company has won a contract from the HSE to design and build a 60 bed ward block at University Hospital Limerick. Minister for Health Simon Harris said he expected the HSE to properly supervise the construction of the new hospital block in Limerick.Last week a further 17 schools were identified as having structural defects, in addition to 22 structures identified last year. Part of Ardgillan Community College in Dublin was closed down as a result of the safety concerns. It remains closed. Two other schools have since moved to new premises. The Department of Education will be carrying out additional detailed investigations on the 17 schools in the coming weeks. Structural remediation work has been carried out in 14 of the initial 22 schools over the holidays, with works to commence in the remaining eight locations later this year.The University of Limerick Hospital Group confirmed Western Building Systems was awarded the contract for the block last May and began work that month.The block, which is a rapid build, will be fully compliant with building regulations and construction will be monitoring by engineers and other staff from HSE estates ision, it said.Speaking in Dublin on Friday, Mr Harris said the 60 extra beds being delivered in the new block would make a big difference to health service provision in the Mid-West region.However, he said he had no role in the award of the contract to build the unit to WBS and did not wish to say anything that might jeopardise the project.The Minister said he had been discussing with the HSE appropriate site supervision during construction and he expected this would be in place.Western Building Systems welcomed the Minister’s comments “in relation to adopting a robust partnership approach”.“We will work with the contracting authorities such as the HSE in respect of whatever structures they deem appropriate as we have also done up to this point in respect of the school building with the Department of Education.”The company said it noted comments from the HSE last year when it stated “there are currently no safety concerns regarding the integrity of its buildings in relation to construction works carried out by Western Buildings Systems at this time”.“We welcome engagement and cooperation with public contracting partners in respect of all such projects, not least to ensure we avoid a situation whereby projects which are deemed to have met contractual requirements and certified as such by Government Departments and agencies are subsequently not deemed to be.”The total capital cost of the ULHG project will be in the region of €19.5 million, with the HSE aiming for works to be completed by the third quarter of 2020. The Minister for Education is suing the Co Tyrone company in seven separate High Court actions lodged last year.

But the 15-year-old, who had special needs, was also “not like other teenagers… not independent”, they said.After she was found to be missing from the Dusun holiday resort, on Sunday, August 4th, shortly after their arrival, they explained: “Nóra can read like a young child, but she cannot write more than a few words. She has a good memory, but she cannot understand anything conceptual.

On Thursday, Malaysian police announced the results of a 10-hour postmortem and said there was no evidence of foul play. The chief of police in the state of Negeri Sembilan, Mohamad Mat Yusop, said: “The cause of death was upper-gastrointestinal bleeding due to a duodenal ulcer complicated with perforation.” There was no evidence that Nóra had been abducted or raped, he added.The bleeding in Nóra’s intestine could have been caused by prolonged hunger and stress, Mohamad said the pathologists dated Nóra’s death to two or three days before her body was found, and to no more than four days.The Quoirin family, who have lived in London for about 20 years, have said they will now bring her home, “where she will finally be laid to rest, close to her loving families in France and Ireland”.Their statement issued on Friday says: “The initial postmortem results have given some information that help us to understand Nóra’s cause of death. But our beautiful, innocent girl died in extremely complex circumstances, and we are hoping that soon we will have more answers to our many questions. We are still struggling to understand the events of the last 10 days.”The Lucie Blackman Trust, which has been helping the family, says that investigations in France will continue. It also urges an end to public speculation. “The police hotline remains open, and the family are still seeking any information from the public that can help to provide clarity on the events of the last 10 days.”A reward of 50,000 ringgit, or about €10,800, had been offered the day before Nóra’s body was found, donated by an anonymous Belfast-based business. The Lucie Blackman Trust, which was set up to support British nationals in crisis overseas, has confirmed that none of the reward has been paid in connection with the discovery of the teenager’s body.Dusun Eco Resort sits in a durian orchard in the foothills of the Titiwangsa Mountains, next to the 1,600-hectare, or 4,000-acre, Berembun Forest Reserve, which is home to sun bears, white-handed gibbons, macaques, wild pigs, panthers, tapirs and muntjac deer. Locals have seen leopard tracks. The resort has six guest houses on the top of a small hill.Many visitors scale Gunung Telapak Buruk, the highest mountain in the vicinity, and some seek out a site where a second World War plane crashed. Locals say many hikers get lost without a torch when night falls, having underestimated the time it takes to get to the crash site.Several questions remain about Nóra’s disappearance and death. Why would she have left the resort in the middle of the night? Did she climb out of the downstairs window that was found open when she disappeared and on which police found unidentified fingerprints?Why was her body found unclothed? If Nóra did walk off into the jungle, why could sniffer dogs pick up her scent only in the immediate vicinity of the guest house? Does this suggest she was abducted?Nóra’s body was found in an area that had already been covered by search-and-rescue teams, so how is it that they did not see her?The area where Nóra’s body was found had been covered until day seven of Nóra’s disappearance. Perhaps, Mohamad Mat Yusop said, Nóra was still moving around at that time. After day seven the search-and-rescue teams concentrated on the Gunung Berembun area.A Daily Mail reporter, Paul Thompson, interviewed Sean Yeap, one of the hikers who discovered Nóra’s body. Yeap told him that the body was not hidden or covered with foliage and said he would have expected search teams that had passed through the area previously to have found it, had it been there at the time.Although police say the bleeding in Nóra’s intestine was most likely caused by prolonged hunger and stress, stomach ulcers can be caused by Helicobacter pylori bacteria. Nóra might have drunk contaminated water, although this cannot be established.“It is not possible she would have willingly left with a stranger,” he said. “If she went out alone by mistake, she would have banged on the door and screamed to be let back in.”Pacôme Quoirin said the family did not question the information released by Malaysian police after the postmortem. “Her death was caused by a haemorrhage, as they said. But what were the conditions that led to it? The findings that were announced in no way discredit a criminal act. She could have been kidnapped and fed at the beginning. There is insufficient evidence to jump to definitive conclusions.”The Quoirins’ lawyer Sankara N Nair said on Wednesday that he would contact the Malaysian attorney general, Tommy Thomas, about holding an inquest into Nóra’s death if the postmortem provided evidence to support that course of action.On Thursday the Malay Mail quoted the Negeri Sembilan police chief as saying the Irish and French police who observed the postmortem were satisfied with the work of the team who had carried it out. The Irish authorities had not requested a second examination.The search for Nóra involved expert trackers from the Senoi Praaq special unit, made up mainly of members of the Orang Asli indigenous people, and members of the elite 69 Commando unit of the Royal Malaysian Police. Divers searched the river that runs through the forest, and helicopters and drones equipped with thermal imaging cameras were deployed.To aid in the search, a recording of Nóra’s mother’s voice was played via megaphones. Search teams also played the recording of Meabh Quoirin’s voice on their mobile phones as they went through the jungle.The Lucie Blackman Trust has been helping the family to deal with the media, and organised the printing of 10,000 flyers to be distributed in Kuala Lumpur and several Malaysian states, including Melaka and Johor.More than £104,000, or €114,000, has been raised by a GoFundMe appeal launched by Aisling Agnew, Nóra’s aunt, on behalf of Nóra’s family. Nearly €20,000 has been raised in a separate GoFundMe appeal set up by Pacôme Quoirin.Hundreds of people in Seremban prayed for Nóra during the Muslim festival of Hari Raya Aidiladha, as Malaysians call Eid ul-Fitr.The Dusun family and staff also expressed their condolences. “We are devastated by the turn of events, and we would like to extend our support and assistance in whatever way possible to the Quoirins during these very difficult times,” they said. A Dusun spokeswoman said on Friday that while investigations continued she could not respond to criticisms of the resort for having insufficient CCTV.There is much speculation about Nóra’s disappearance. It ranges from the cautious public statements by some members of the Quoirin family, probing aspects of the investigation, to the numerous theories – some fanciful – advanced on social media.Many Malaysians believe in spirits and there is even talk of her having been hidden by the Orang bunian, supernatural beings known as the hidden or whistling people, who are said to be invisible except to people with spiritual sight and are generally regarded as benevolent.The tragedy has had an impact both locally and internationally, but none have felt it so keenly as her family. After Nóra’s disappearance and the harrowing search for her, the Quoirins are having to deal not only with the results of the postmortem but also with the devastating loss of a girl her mother described as “precious” and “vulnerable since the day she was born”.Her family have many unanswered questions. Some may never be answered, but, as the investigation by Malaysian police continues, the hope is that at least the most important ones will be."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3991058.1566236683!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"merkel and orban call for unity at border where iron curtain cracked","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGerman chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban: Dr Merkel has praised Hungary’s border guards for “showing the courage to place humanity above the rules” in 1989. Photograph: Attila KisbenedekAFPGerman chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban have glossed over their differences and called for European unity as they marked the 30th anniversary of a picnic for peace that pierced the Iron Curtain.They attended commemoration events on Monday in Sopron, western Hungary, close to where more than 600 East Germans ran across the border into neighbouring Austria during the so-called Pan-European Picnic on August 19th, 1989.The refusal of Hungarian border guards to stop them, and the Soviet Union’s decision not to react, emboldened pro-democracy movements across central Europe which in the following months brought down the Berlin Wall and toppled communist regimes across the region.“We Germans recall with great gratitude Hungary’s contribution to overcoming the ision of Europe and also Hungary’s contribution to achieving German reunification,” Dr Merkel said during a church service in Sopron.“Let’s move forward together in freedom, democracy and unity. In this, too, it can give us all strength when we remember the Pan-European Picnic. That is why it is very important for us today to celebrate with the Hungarian prime minister in a place where world history was written 30 years ago.”Germany strongly opposes Mr Orban’s hard-line anti-immigration policy, but Dr Merkel offered only oblique criticism of his construction of fences on Hungary’s southern border in 2015 to keep out refugees and migrants.‘A humane Europe’“Sopron is an example of how we can achieve everything by standing up for our values. Sopron is the symbol of a humane Europe,” she said, while praising Hungary’s border guards in 1989 for “showing the courage to place humanity above the rules”.“Sometimes, we have to jump over our own shadows to assume our joint responsibilities towards Europe and the world. The refugees arriving from war zones, seeking shelter here, remind us of the importance of fighting against the things that force them to flee.”Mr Orban and other populist leaders in central Europe have denounced Germany’s stance on asylum and EU efforts to distribute refugees around the bloc, and the immigration debate has caused perhaps the deepest rifts in the bloc since a host of ex-communist states joined in 2004.Echoing incoming European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, a former German defence minister, Dr Merkel looked ahead to a “new start, a new beginning to see how we are able to come to common terms” on migration.Rule of lawMr Orban was a liberal pro-democracy activist in 1989, but now his government is facing EU legal action over alleged threats to the rule of law posed by his proudly illiberal reforms in areas ranging from asylum to education.“We believe that we are the fortress captains of the Germans when we are protecting the external borders of Europe, which are also at the same time Germany’s external borders. We are doing this at our own cost. They could be sending us more contributions, ammunition but it seems that border protection is our obligation and we will continue to perform this,” Mr Orban declared.“Thirty years ago, on this day, we broke the fence between the free world and Hungary with our East German counterparts. With this breakthrough, the wall that separated our country from Europe and made it part of the Soviet world collapsed . . . Even in times of ision, our freedom fighters knew that there was only one Europe. Europe was reunited because we believed in it,” he continued.“Everything depends on this today. If we believe in it, the unity of the east and the west will remain, and Europe will once again become a rich and strong home for the peoples of Europe.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3991086.1566238114!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british government to launch no deal brexit pr blitz","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson  during a visit to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro on Monday. Photograph: Simon DawsonEPABoris Johnson’s government is to launch a major public information campaign to reassure Britons about a potential no-deal Brexit, as the prime minister said he was “confident” the EU would change its position on the Irish border backstop.Downing Street declined to comment on the leaked document about Operation Yellowhammer, its planning for a no-deal Brexit. But officials said the document was “out of date” and did not reflect the government’s state of preparedness. Whitehall insiders said the media campaign, with a budget of £100 million, would begin in the next couple of weeks to explain in a “user-friendly way” what iniduals needed to do ahead of Brexit day on October 31st. In an effort to rebut the stark warnings in a leaked contingency planning paper, the emphasis will be on consumers.Those with knowledge of the preparations said the campaign would be run on TV, radio and social media. The government is working to ensure that its official website is ready for a significant increase in traffic once the campaign launches. It will include details of what consumers need to do to be prepared for travel abroad.A Number 10 spokesperson said “further information will be published in the coming weeks” on government preparations for leaving the EU with or without a deal, noting that Mr Johnson had “significantly stepped up planning” for no-deal. Downing Street insisted it had been “engaging widely” with businesses, despite lobby groups expressing concern that smaller firms were underprepared.Mr Johnson insists he still wants to strike a deal with Brussels. But during a visit to a hospital in Cornwall, he said it was “very much up to our friends” to change their stance on the withdrawal agreement, admitting that other European nations were “showing a little bit of reluctance”.“They have seen that the UK parliament has three times rejected the withdrawal agreement, the backstop just doesn’t work, it’s not democratic and I hope that they will see fit to compromise but in the meantime we get ready to come out on October 31st,” he told Sky News.“That’s fine, I’m confident that they will. But in the meantime we have to get ready for a no-deal outcome. I want a deal. We’re ready to work with our friends and partners to get a deal. But if you want a good deal for the UK, you must simultaneously get ready to come out without one.”Widespread disruptionResponding to the leaked Yellowhammer document, Mr Johnson added that he was “very confident” that the government would be ready for departure on October 31st, with or without a deal. “I’m not pretending that there won’t be bumps on the road. There will be, I said that on the steps of Downing Street, but if everybody puts their minds to it I have absolutely no doubt that we can get ready.”The Yellowhammer document said the consequences of a no-deal exit could be widespread disruption - possibly for months - to trade, food and medicine distribution, fishing, and fuel supplies, and civil unrest.Parliament will have a chance to scrutinise no-deal planning in early September. Michael Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal preparations, will update MPs on the government’s preparatory work for Brexit when it returns on September 3rd, according to officials.This will be the first of what will become weekly updates to the House of Commons on preparations for leaving the EU and Mr Gove is expected to cover the activities of the daily and weekly committees working on deal preparations.Downing Street has rejected a call from 110 MPs to recall parliament early from its summer recess to allow further scrutiny of its Brexit plans.“The House of Commons agreed the date it would rise for summer recess, as well as its return on September 3rd and this was passed by a majority of close to 200 MPs,” a spokesperson said.Only the government has the power to recall parliament early.No-confidence motionIn a keynote speech in Corby, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would table a vote of no confidence in the Johnson government when parliament returns next month.However, Mr Corbyn did not spell out whether this would be tabled immediately after parliament returns on September 3rd or at some later date.“I will bring a vote of no confidence in the government, and if we’re successful, I would seek to form a time-limited caretaker administration to avert no deal, and call an immediate general election so the people can decide our country’s future,” he said.Mr Corbyn ruled out suggestions by some MPs that a caretaker government could only be formed by a figure commanding wider support across the Commons.Mr Corbyn said the “constitutional precedent” was for the leader of the opposition to “take over” if a government falls from power. He said MPs determined to block a no-deal had to understand that it “falls to the leader of the opposition to make sure no deal does not happen”. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

But now they are on a collision course with cyclists who are demanding the right to ride their bikes on the same routes through the tranquil countryside.British Cycling, backed by Olympic gold medallist and keen mountain biker Chris Boardman MBE, is spearheading efforts to reform rights of way legislation that bans bicycles from more than two-thirds of the paths.It says the myriad of current laws are outdated and confusing, and only allow walkers to enjoy outstanding trails through beauty spots such as the Cotswold Hills.Instead it has called for all paths to be classed as multi-use, meaning cyclists could ride along them, unless there are good reasons not to. UK hiking trails for beginners | by Tina Gardner from the British Mountaineering CouncilThe proposals, currently under review by the Welsh government, have been met with fierce opposition from walkers who believe their legal rights are under threat.The Ramblers, an association of 500 UK walking groups, says that each pathway should be carefully reviewed before its status is changed. Gemma Cantelo, Head of Advocacy and Policy for the Ramblers said: Some of our paths, because of their character or physical features, are not suitable as multi-use routes. That’s why we don’t back proposals, as seen in Wales, to move towards a presumption that all paths should be multi-use. Instead, we support a case-by-case approach to ‘upgrading’ footpaths to make sure that they continue to be safe and attractive to walkers, including those who are less physically able. In order to protect walkers, we’d like to see clear codes of responsible behaviour introduced. Unless the landowner allows it, cycling on a footpath in England and Wales is normally considered trespass, making it a civil but not a criminal matter. Local by-laws or Traffic Regulation Orders (TRO) covering particular footpaths can make it a criminal offence.Who needs the Camino de Santiago when you can hike through South Wales?British Cycling\u0027s campaign has won support from Cycling UK, a group championed by Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow.Both organisations stress that they want to bring in rules of responsibility to ensure cyclists would use public footpaths safely. It would be based on the Scottish Land Reform Act, which gave cyclists access to almost all public footpaths north of the border in 2003. Duncan Dollimore, Cycling UK’s head of campaigns said: “Conflict sometimes arises because people feel either entitled or annoyed because they perceive someone is using their particular space. Cycling UK wants to see England develop a better, more modern system for determining access rights – one based on suitability of use rather than historic use. Scotland has it, and Wales is developing one – it’s about time England caught up.“This would go a long way to calming the rare conflict we see on our trails and would mean more people can enjoy the great benefits of the English countryside.”Stride in style | The hiking must-havesNews of the plans renewed tensions between ramblers and cyclists, who became embroiled in angry exchanges on social media. Walker Bob Murray tweeted: Far too many cyclists ignore the principle that walkers have the right of way and belt past them at dangerous speeds without warning. A simple ring on a bell at an appropriate distance and passing at slower speeds is greatly appreciated. Very few do.Cyclist Emma Morris wrote: Walkers are tarring cyclists with the same brush.Some of us don’t speed passed walkers, some of us are polite and respectful.  We cycle up to 70km a week on bridleways and never see a single walker!A British Cycling spokesman said: “England and Wales are packed with outstanding countryside on millions of people’s doorsteps but, due to outdated and confusing rights of way legislation, much of it is only open to you if you choose to walk. “We know that many people will simply not consider cycling unless they can do it on a traffic-free route. Countryside paths are fantastic, free alternatives that could be enjoyed and shared responsibly by people on bike, on foot and on horseback.”Department for Environment, Food \u0026amp Rural Affairs (DEFRA)Woman detained unlawfully who suffered miscarriage granted £50,000 payoutJihadi Jack would escape prosecution for joining Isil under Candian law loophole, Canadians admitJihadi Jack seeks move to Canada after being stripped of British citizenship for joining Isil terror groupComment: Greta Thunberg is selling the rich an eco-lifestyle the rest of us will never be able to affordHuge pile of manure with signs saying \u0026#39the landlord is f---ing my wife\u0026#39 appears outside country pubG7 must ban detergents that cause sea pollution, say French campaignersDaily  readers go where the Poet Laureate fears to tread and offer dozens of poems to mark Brexit on October 31\u0026#39It\u0026#39s a nightmare\u0026#39: the reality of European border controls in a small Polish townThe Marchioness disaster, 30 years on: ‘51 people died in central London, it’s still outrageous’New York police officer fired for deadly chokehold on Eric GarnerVenezuelan number two Diosdado Cabello \u0026#39in secret talks with US\u0026#39, Trump administration official claimsBlow for Nicola Sturgeon as election watchdog says it must review indyref2 questionBritish Council worker Aras Amiri loses appeal against 10-year sentence in IranBrexit Day 2019: When is the UK due to leave the EU and how will it happen?Pakistan\u0026#39s powerful army chief gets three more years at top amid Kashmir tension and Afghan peace driveUndercover police officer stabbed attempting stop and search, court hearsModel railway collections that took 36 years to build destroyed in minutes by drunk schoolboysHow would a vote of no confidence work?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/08/14/nivern1.jpg","title":"brexit daniel nivern international recruitment agency china","story":"IM Subscribe NowIM Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.IM  Subscribe NowIM  Subscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 1 monthSee the optionsCreated with Sketch.After spending his postgrad summer teaching English in a small town near Beijing, Nivern\u0026nbsptells Andy Martin how he saw how he could help others from around the world work in the eastClick to followThe IndependentIt doesn’t matter whether you like Brexit or not,” Daniel Nivern was saying as we walked up Baker Street, “you still have to take China into account.” Of course he would say that as co-founder and CEO of CRCC Asia, which is the world’s biggest provider of work experience placements in China. But, all the same, he has a strong case. “Do you know what percentage of people live in Asia?” he asked. I guessed around 50 per cent. It turns out to be 60 per cent. 4 billion people in Asia. A mere 700 million in Europe. QED.\u0026nbspNivern, now 37, is a posterboy for the utility of studying modern languages. At 14 he went on a school exchange to Paris. Brought up in Manchester, he found himself living across the street from the Louvre. At 17 he got a summer job in a factory outside Paris, packing cakes in boxes, where he was known as “Anglais”. “I was impressed that, even in the industrial zone, they still stopped for a proper lunch with a baguette and a bottle of wine.”This was the summer of 1998, the year of the Mondial in France. He tried – and failed – to get into the World Cup final at the Stade de France, but watched France beat Brazil 3-0 on a screen outside and saw the whole city go mad. “I couldn’t get home and I couldn’t get to work the next day either.” He went on to take French and German at Keble College, Oxford, specialising in 17th century French theatre. “Learning languages opens up your eyes to other parts of the world,” he says. “I just wanted to keep on going.”\u0026nbspWhich explains why, a couple of months after graduating, he took a job teaching English in a high school in a town, Hengshui (“not scenic, but with wonderful people”), three hours south of Beijing. With practically no knowledge of Chinese. He just threw himself in at the deep end and found he could float. When he got back to England he switched to international management and Chinese for his masters at Soas (the School of Oriental and African Studies), London. \u0026nbspNivern joined forces with fellow student Ed Holroyd Pearce (who had studied Oriental languages at Cambridge) to set up not just one but two companies, China Recruitment and China Consulting. “The simple idea was to make it easier for people to do what we did.” Those two eventually fused into one, CRCC Asia. They arrange the jobs (across a range of sectors), travel, accommodation and visas, and do all the networking for you. From small beginnings in Nivern’s kitchen in 2006, they now have a team of 50 working out of offices across Asia, collaborating with companies large and small. Nivern is based in Philadelphia, where he has set up partnerships with American universities like Texas and Michigan. And they are now expanding into South Korea, Japan and Vietnam. \u0026nbspI would love to say I get it right all the time. But the Chinese are incredibly receptive to foreigners trying to speak ChineseThis year they expect to send some 1,500 college students and graduates (generally between 18 and 23) to internships in Beijing, Shanghai, Seoul, Tokyo, Ho Chi Minh City and… Manchester (it works in reverse too).

Globalism – combined with Brexit – is persuading a lot of young people to look east in search of work experience and an enhanced CV.\u0026nbspNivern picked up the Mandarin language relatively late. “I would love to say I get it right all the time. But the Chinese are incredibly receptive to foreigners trying to speak Chinese.” He reckons that the grammar is not as difficult as German, “what’s tricky is the tonality.” The same syllable, “Ma”, can mean either “mother” or “horse” (and a few other things), depending. “Hopefully the context helps,” says Nivern. A sentence involving a mother riding a horse is a well-known tongue twister. Most people, like Nivern himself, go to China with no Chinese, “but we encourage everyone to try – it makes a huge difference”.\u0026nbspChina bans actors and films from Asian awards ceremony in TaiwanChina warns Hong Kong protesters as police amass near borderAsian stocks fall as China hits back at US claim of yuan manipulationNivern says that China is like an onion: “You can go on peeling off layers. You think you know it but you don’t.” In CRCC Asia’s “Career Bridge” programme (which gives you training in “intercultural fluency”), one of the key concepts they try to get across to those new to China is mianzi or “face”. You can give face and you can lose face. Nobody wants to lose it. You have to be sensitive to hierarchy in China. If you’re arranging a dinner party, you put the least senior person closest to the door. Conversation should be addressed to the most senior person (like a government official) to begin with. If there is a toast, you can clink glasses, but you have to make sure the rim of your glass is lower than the local bigwig’s glass, otherwise you risk giving offence. By going lower you are giving face. “There’s sometimes a battle as to who goes lower,” says Nivern. “You can end up on the floor.”\u0026nbspJust as Nivern was inspired by the 1998 World Cup, so too, 10 years later, the Beijing Olympics of 2008 gave CRCC Asia a significant boost. The Chinese government took the games seriously enough to close factories and pull vehicles off the road with a view to cutting pollution. “It was all perfectly choreographed. You could say regimented. The closing ceremony was fantastic too.”\u0026nbspApparently the thing that shocked his Chinese friends most was the sight of then mayor of London, Boris Johnson, leading our 2012 handover, looking scruffy, with his jacket unbuttoned, one hand in his pocket, and his shirt hanging half out. He showed a lack of respect and lost a lot of face that day. “But at least I managed to get into the stadium this time,” said Nivern. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two consecutive quarters of contraction are typically defined as a recession.The contraction between April and June was mostly driven by sinking demand from abroad, the Bundesbank said. Exports “were down substantially”, it noted, as pre-Brexit preparations ahead of the UK’s initial exit date at the end of March prompted companies to build up stocks in the first quarter.“As things currently stand, it is unclear whether exports and, by extension, industry will regain their footing before the domestic economy becomes more severely affected,” the Bundesbank said.Appetite for German cars and other goods has also waned in China as growth in the world’s second-largest economy is cooling, partly due to the year-long trade war with the US.Up until a week ago, economists surveyed by Bloomberg were predicting\u0026nbspthat Germany’s economy will grow by 0.2 per cent in the current quarter.But since then big-name institutions including Deutsche Bank have lowered their expectations. The concern for many analysts is that continuing global trade tensions will prolong the downturn in German manufacturing and eventually feed through to the still-strong services sector.The central bank’s forecast follows weeks of disappointing economic data and news of meagre earnings at German companies. The government has signalled that it might be willing to step up spending should the downturn worsen.The European Central Bank is also considering providing extra monetary stimulus to the wider euro zone.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Although it was higher than a year ago, the 1.2 per cent annual rise still lagged behind inflation, which is running at 2.1 per cent, according to the latest official data.“There is little doubt that the market continues to face its inevitable challenges,” said Glynis Frew, chief executive of Hunters, an estate agency with over 200 branches across Britain.Official data showed last week that the average price at which homes are sold grew only 0.9 per cent in the year to June, while in London it tumbled by 2.7 per cent. The average British home cost £230,292 in June, down from a peak of £232,000 in August 2018.Buyers have been biding their time as it remains unclear whether the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal. In the latter case, house prices could plunge by almost 6 per cent in 2020 and another 3 per cent in 2021, according to forecasts by the government’s spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility.However, the more confident buyers are now abandoning the ‘wait and see’ approach and taking advantage of improved housing affordability as the Brexit deadline nears, Ms Frew said, commenting on Rightmove’s findings.For its latest report, Rightmove measured 130,435 asking prices, covering around 90 per cent of the UK market. The properties were put on sale by estate agents between 7 July to 10 August and advertised on rightmove.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The predicament of the young prince, Segismundo, calls to mind the Chinese sage\u0027s story of the man who dreams he is a butterfly and wakes to wonder whether he is actually a butterfly dreaming he is a man. This youth is at the mercy of political fluctuation: he\u0027s been imprisoned in a dark tower from birth because of a horoscope that predicted he would usurp the throne. Then, when there are anxieties about the succession, his father has him drugged, brought to the Palace, and bafflingly treated like a prince. A poetic piece that tackles deep metaphysical, political matters in a dazzlingly theatrical way. PTA play of astonishing breakthroughs. There had been plenty of soliloquies in Elizabethan drama beforehand. But no-one had ever talked to an audience like Hamlet. He doesn\u0027t just let you into his confidence, he lets you into his consciousness the best portrayals make you feel that you are soul-to-soul with this figure. It\u0027s his capacity for searching introspection that gets in the way and disqualifies Hamlet as a revenge hero: he\u0027s rather wonderfully miscast. Hamlet is brilliantly self-reflexive, constantly probing its own theatricality. The conscience of Claudius is tested by a play-within-a play Hamlet tries to fool the court by assuming an “antic disposition” that may at times waver into authentic madness. The piece is like a painful meditation on the contradicting meanings of the verb to “act” – to feign and to intervene. Inexhaustible. PTFeminism and expressionism collide in US playwright Sophie Treadwell\u0027s extraordinary vision of a mechanised, dehumanising metropolis. We feel the nerve-shredding racket of modern existence – described as “this purgatory of noise” – assaulting the Everywoman character at every stage as she makes her descent to doom. She\u0027s a stenographer, a sensitive cog in the machine who is blackmailed by her mother into marriage with a boss who revolts her, and ends up condemned to the electric chair for murdering him. Treadwell\u0027s nagging dialogue, with its jangly staccato and syncopated telegraphese, uncannily anticipates Harold Pinter and David Mamet. Her cry against institutionalised misogyny – “I will not submit” – resounds down the ages. PTIn Gogol\u0027s great phantasmagoric farce, an impecunious clerk newly arrived from St Petersburg is mistakenly assumed to be the eponymous inspector by the corrupt mayor and officials of this provincial town. Panic drives these paranoid locals to project a false identity onto this stranger. That would have been a good enough joke. Gogol, though, gives it an inspired, twist. His penniless nonenity turns out to be driven by an equivalent dread of being recognised as one of life\u0027s losers. So when he twigs to their exploitable mistake, he treats their absurd respect (not to mention their bribes) as long-overdue recognition of his true worth and becomes airborne with grandiosity. It\u0027s the interlocking lunacies that generate the comic delirium in this Russian masterpiece. PTOne of Pinter\u0027s most haunting and unnerving pieces. A married couple, Kate and Deeley, play games of power and possessiveness with the wife\u0027s former flatmate, Anna, who comes to visit for the first time in 20 years. The piece is horribly preoccupied with the use people make of selective – and conceivably invented – memories as weapon or way of gaining the upper hand. We mint memories, in this understanding of it, in response to the psychological needs of the moment: “There are things I remember which may never have happened, but as I recall them.” Deeley is threatened by Anna\u0027s youthful relationship to his wife and strongly attracted to the newcomer. There’s a wonderful evocation of rackety London when the girls lived as secretaries, but the uneasy comedy of all this turns lethal. PTThe best Jacobean tragedy outside Shakespeare, The Changeling also seems to anticipate film noir. The heroine hires a shady type to bump off her fiance. This villain has a facial disfigurement, but the piece is alert to how perversely attracted we are to what repels us. The assassin demands her virginity as his blood-money and the slide into shadowy corruption becomes inexorable. There is a subplot in a madhouse that is designed as a distorted mirror of the main action in its obsession with disguise, lunacy, and sex. PTThis Pulitzer-winning American playwright explores the history of her great-grandmother in early 20th century New York. Esther is a black seamstress – unmarried and illiterate – who sews ravishingly beautiful garments for other women to wear on their wedding nights. She gets what could be a last chance of happiness but it\u0027s destroyed in circumstances that are never sentimentalised. The sensual feel of fine fabric (her means of supporting and expressing herself) is conveyed with gorgeous descriptive power. Intimate Apparel manages to be uplifting without ever losing its irreverent humour. PTSophocles\u0027s play is still the most powerful ever written about the conflict between our obligations to the state and our duty to the ties of kinship. Antigone defies her uncle Kreon, the new ruler of Thebes, by burying her brother Polyneikes. He had brought an army against his native city and Kreon, in these politically volatile times, wants his corpse left for the dogs as an exemplary desecration. The philosopher Hegel saw this as the quintessence of true tragedy: not a conflict between good and evil, but between right and right. In fact, productions nowadays tend to come down in favour of Antigone and her self-sacrificing intransigence. PTRichard Bean had the inspired idea of transposing Goldoni\u0027s 18th century commedia dell\u0027arte romp from Venice to Brighton in 1963. Our jack-the-lad hero – frantically trying to hold down a pair of jobs, unbeknownst to either boss – is a failed skiffle player. The complications are deliciously warped. One character does a bunk to Brighton disguised as her psychotic twin brother who has been bumped off by her posh twit of a boyfriend in a gangland brawl. Still with me? The dialogue is naughty and knowing, but there\u0027s a terrific innocent joy to the physical clowning which peaks in the delirious sequence where our hero has to dish up lunch to the two masters at the same time. PTA supreme example of how a writer can make a play by putting together a triptych of miniatures. Holman was brought up in the pacifist tradition and Making Noise Quietly looks at the long-range effects of war in three chance encounters. In the first, set in a Kent field in 1943, a northern Quaker and an uninhibited London aesthete discuss their reasons for not fighting. In the second, a naval officer arrives to tell a mother of her son’s death in the Falklands War. The third is set in the Black Forest in 1986. An English private, gone AWOL with his disturbed eight-year-old stepson, come into testing collision with a rich German businesswoman who survived the Holocaust. There\u0027s a stunning scene in which she draws the little boy out of his dogmatic mutism by her repeated, stern insistence that he says “thank you” it\u0027s uplifing in the end but it\u0027s not pretty. Writing of rare sensitivity and cumulative power. PTThough he described it as “the lightest of light comedies”, Private Lives is the Noel Coward play that one would undoubtedly preserve for posterity. He wrote it as a vehicle for himself and Gertrude Lawrence, with indecent speed. The play centres on two orcees who, five years after their split, bump into each other on adjacent hotel balconies while on the first night of honeymoons with their new spouses. An elegantly contrived coincidence followed by a pattern of cheekily reversed expectations: most comedies end in marriage this one begins with nobbled nuptials as the couple unceremoniously ditch their second partners and abscond to Paris together. Elyot and Amanda are the kind of flighty egotistical couple that can neither live together nor apart. Anti-romantic comedy soaked in sex (and romance): “Don\u0027t quibble Sybil.” PT1240 Angels in America (1990-93), Tony KushnerSubtitled “A Gay Fantasia on National Themes”, Tony Kushner\u0027s astonishing two-part play is set in the AIDS crisis of the mid-1980s during the right wing administration of Ronald Reagan. The word AIDS was never mentioned by the President, and the struggle to find a cure was hampered by a lack of government recognition. Kushner retaliated by putting gay men centre stage in an epic that shows them fighting to forge their private and public destinies. This is, however, very far from a conventional “issue” play in its glorious ambition. The piece rages from Antarctica and the damaged ozone layer to a baroque heaven that god has abandoned. Prophetic angels crash through ceilings. There are “mutual dream” sequences where people wander in and out of each other\u0027 fantasies. The presiding demon of the piece is one of drama\u0027s greatest monsters: the incorrigible and shameless Roy Cohn was a real-life Republican fixer (and mentor to the young Donald Trump). PTA middle-aged woman is buried in a mound of earth first up to the waist then, after the interval, up to the neck. It is a sight that has never lost its capacity to startle. Beckett\u0027s Winnie prattles away dogged with optimism (“This will have been another happy day”) in a loquacious attempt to stave off hysteria and despair at her encroaching fate. Partly irritating, partly heroic, she brings forth a dotty lyrical monologue that\u0027s threaded with genteel half-remembered wisps from the “immortal” classics. Peter Hall, who directed Peggy Ashcroft in the part, rightly pointed out that “Beckett\u0027s theatre is as much about mime and physical precision as it is about words”. Except that his texts are great and this one is superb beyond belief. To quote Winnie: “What is that unforgettable line?” PT1440  Long Day’s Journey into Night (1940), Eugene O NeillWhen O\u0027Neill described Long Day\u0027s Journey as a “play of old sorrow, written in blood and tears”, he was barely exaggerating. This enormous autobiographical drama is so raw and unremitting in its revelations about his dysfunctional Irish-Catholic family that the author left instructions – mercifully disobeyed by his widow – that the play was not to be performed until 25 years after his death. You can understand the trepidation. Long Day\u0027s Journey plunges deep into the tortured heart of the Tyrones – James, the acclaimed actor who sold out to commercial success, his wife Mary who has recently relapsed into morphine addiction, and their two sons. When the play is under the baton of the right director, it\u0027s the like listening to the recapitulations in a great piece of music. You emerge drained but in a state of elating catharsis. PTHector wants to teach boys knowledge that will last them a lifetime. But the headmaster has become obsessed with government league tables and has hired Irwin to teach them glib, exam-passing techniques. That\u0027s the clash at the heart of Alan Bennett\u0027s hugely popular hit. It\u0027s set at a Yorkshire grammar amongst a group of clever sixth-formers. As with a lot of Bennett\u0027s work you can discern a revue-like structure in the play\u0027s glorious string of skits, gags, songs and sheer elating silliness. But it\u0027s also a brilliant portrait of a maverick teacher. The scene in which the doomed Hector analyses the Hardy poem “Drummer Hodge” with his pupil Posner is unsurpassed in drama as an example of humane teaching. Gay, unhappy Posner also has the play\u0027s best joke: “I\u0027m a Jew. I\u0027m small. I\u0027m homosexual. And I live in Sheffield. I\u0027m fucked.” PTFrank Hardy, an itinerant Irish faith healer, his wife, and his manager tell four monologues that contradict each other, leaving the audience to question truth and memory, lies and storytelling. Frank struggles to understand his own “gift”, and how his ability to cure comes and goes Faith Healer is also a parable about the artist and his inspiration. The play foundered when it opened on Broadway, but has since been recognised as a modern classic: in a good production, there’s a trembling sort of power to it. Friel’s writing can be rhythmical, incantatory, but it’s also gorgeously subtle. Although Friel throughout maintains a – crucial – ambivalence, the play attains a sort of transcendent grace of its own. HWPlays by this American writer tend to be long, slow – and strangely riveting. It’s hard to pin down what exactly makes John so bewitching. It is set in a kitschy, tat-filled Gettysburg guesthouse, where a fighting young couple interact with the dotty landlady and her blind but visionary friend. The house seems haunted: creepy dolls and pianos start playing themselves. But it’s also haunted by history (it was a civil war hospital), and by the older women’s memories of love, ghosts, and their own mystical experiences. All of this is a little spooky, but also rather emotionally stirring. Baker is also super sharp on the millennial couple’s dying relationship, which opens out into a look at how it’s often women who have to prop up men’s myths, to feed their needy hunger. HWFrom “I have always depended on the kindness of strangers” to “Stellaaaaaa”, Williams’s play has entered the popular consciousness. As well it might: there’s something eternal in its themes of loss, ageing, and the lies we live by. Fear and lust rub up against each other, sweatily few other writers have captured the heat of the South like Williams, and this is the playwright at his most atmospheric. Blanche DuBois – the deluded southern belle who shacks up with her sister and her macho, abusive husband – is a summit part for an actress, and everyone from Vivien Leigh to Tallulah Bankhead, Cate Blanchett to Gillian Anderson have had a go. HWThe only surviving full trilogy of Greek tragedies, through Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides Aeschylus traces the impact of violence and revenge down a Royal family, throwing questions of justice and duty into sharp relief. To win the Trojan war, Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter the trilogy opens with a play in which his wife Clytemnestra kills him to avenge her daughter’s death. In Libation Bearers, Clytemnestra’s son Orestes murders her in retaliation (if Antigone is a tragedy because it’s a conflict between right and right, this is perhaps a clash between wrong and wrong). The cycle is broken in Eumenides, where the gods form a court in which to try Orestes. It’s juicy, meaty, high-octane stuff – and has been given era-defining productions both in Peter Hall masked version at the National in 1981, and in Robert Icke’s crisp modern adaptation in 2015. HWPart of the playwright’s cycle exploring the African-American experience in 20th century American –  a play for each decade – this chapter is set in a Chicago recording studio in 1927. Ma Rainey, the “mother of the blues”, is slow to show up to record some tunes. Instead, we watch her band kill time and spar with one another. Although it all lands light as a butterfly, the script is stinging on subjects such as ambition and race relations. Ma Rainey, when she arrives, proves worth waiting for: an immense, haughty presence. There’s a twist towards the end, giving the play punch – plus the tunes are great, of course. HWIbsen wrote great women: we could have gone for Hedda Gabler. But A Doll’s House is one of those plays with a wide significance: written in 1879, it’s a proto-feminist text. When our troubled heroine Nora slams the door at the end of the play, it’s not just on her patronising husband, but on the whole of The Patriarchy. The play shocked some in its portrayal of a woman made so desperate by her suffocating domestic situation that she abandons her children as well as her husband, choosing freedom and self-actualistion over the prison of the home. Of course, things have changed for women since, but this exceptionally controlled play still unfolds perfectly – and that slam still resonates. HWYou could make a case for any of Chekhov’s plays really (we nearly went for his early, entertaining Platonov, just to be different) but the lucidity of The Seagull wins out. It’s got more plot, a sliver less ennui, than some of his others: a young man, Konstantin, longs to be a playwright his narcissistic mother Arkadina – an actress – is wrapped up in her new boyfriend, Trigorin, a successful novelist. He in turn romances Nina, Konstantin’s girlfriend and an aspiring actress. It’s not much of a spoiler to say none of their dreams exactly come true, life proving endlessly, exquisitely disappointing. The Seagull is a mordant comedy – scenes skewering both Arkadina’s monstrous ego and her son’s attempts at avant garde art are some of the best bits of theatre-about-theatre ever. But there’s also an unbearable tenderness to the play’s portrayal of young love, hope, and idealism. HW2340  Mother Courage and Her Children (1939), Bertolt Brecht Few, if any, playwrights of the 20th century had as much of an impact on theatre as Brecht: he wanted art to be a political tool rather than escapist entertainment, but also revolutionised theatrical form and style, doing away with naturalism. But it can mean his “epic theatre” is still associated with didacticism, rather than drama. Not so Mother Courage, though, which is epic in both senses: written after Hitler invaded Poland, but set during the Thirty-Years\u0027 War, it is a potent story of one mother’s attempts to profit from conflict, and the huge cost war always takes in the end. HWBased on the Greek myth where Medea kills her children in order to get revenge on her unfaithful husband, this tragedy has lost none of its force – or power to shock. But the text allows more sympathetic readings Medea too, as a woman fighting for justice in an unjust world. With a monumental lead part, and a chorus who react and comment on the action, the play has always been one of the most popular of the Greek tragedies. Taut and tense, you see the horror coming but feel desperately compelled to look. HWThe mother of a murdered child. Her imprisoned paedophile killer. A criminal psychologist attempting to understand what drove him to do it. Through first monologues, and then dialogue, this modem classic has much to say about the extremes of human anguish, but also our capacity for change, and for forgiveness. It’s a dark and thorny work, but a deeply humane one too, by a prolific British writer at her best. HW2640 The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), Oscar Wilde Has there every been such a reliably delightful comedy? The improbable plot of tangled engagements, lost handbags, invented wicked relatives, and real monstrous aunts runs like clockwork. There are innumerable blissful one-liners, the characters are delicious upper-class twits, and at every turn Wilde has a fine old time pricking societal niceties. It’s frothy fun, and funny froth, and always invites larger-than-life performances. Being so very bankable has led to Wilde’s play certainly being over-staged and it now feels thoroughly un-urgent – and then it makes you laugh all over again. HWSherman’s harrowing play pulls the rug from under you. You invest in the relationship between Max and Rudy, a decadent gay couple in Berlin in 1934 – but after the Night of the Long Knives they flee, before being caught and sent to Dachau. On the way, Max’s desire to survive produces sickening betrayal. He pretends to be Jewish rather than gay, but in the camp meets Horst, a man who reveals the honour in being true to one’s self. There’s an astonishing scene where – forbidden to touch – they have sex purely through words. Ian McKellen originally played Max, but Richard Gere and Alan Cummings have also taken on the role in what is now seen as seminal gay text – one that proves truth and love may flower in the most horrific, hopeless circumstances. HWAh, the transformative power of theatre… This familiar idea is irresistibly proven by Wertenbaker’s oft-revived play, based on a true story about a group of convicts in an Australian penal colony who put on a production of George Farquhar’s The Recruiting Officer. It has fun sending up the pretensions of theatre, but ultimately uses it as means for talking about empathy, communication, and understanding, as relations between the reviled prisoners and the cruel officers thaw. A direct piece of storytelling with a huge heart. HWLucy Prebble made her name with ENRON, charting the hubris of the financial giant, but while it may be less flashy, The Effect is still dazzlingly good. It has, at its heart, a question we’d all like to know the answer to: what is love? The play follows two volunteers in a clinical trial for a new anti-depressant when they fall for each other, they wonder whether their love is “real”, or a by-product. And given all interactions in the brain are just chemical, does it even matter? The idea of what’s really real and what’s really romantic, what happiness is and what function unhappiness might have, are turned over by Prebble’s own very sharp mind. Her characters are fun to spend time with, her dialogue is snappy, but she digs deep too, into both scientific theories and human emotions, taking us from the grey lows of depression to the technicolour highs of new love. HWIt can be hard to separate this play from an animating original performance by the great Mark Rylance, who played Johnny “Rooster” Byron – a wild misfit who lives in a caravan in the woods in rural England, gathering local young people to him like some kind of drink-and-drug-fuelled pied piper. Such a summary might sound tawdry, yet set on St George’s Day and ripe with Rooster’s storytelling, it has a mythic, mystical quality. A state-of-the-nation show powered by anti-establishment brio, it also precisely captures a contemporary rural community (very sweary, and very funny). Jerusalem became a ridiculously big hit, with audiences camping out round the theatre for tickets. But a recent revival suggests the play can still crow, whoever plays Rooster. HWWhat makes a great play? A lot of critics, academics, and playwrights themselves will point to form matching content. On this, Tim Crouch’s glitteringly clever play really delivers – while also being extremely moving. A stage hypnotist encounters the father of a girl he killed in a car accident. The father truly believes his daughter has been transformed into oak tree. At every performance, the father is played by an actor who’s never seen or read the play before they are given a script or fed lines by – yes – the hypnotist (played initially by Crouch himself, also acknowledging his “real” role as the playwright). The actor is transformed before us we accept that they are now the father. An Oak Tree has a radical honesty which has made it hugely influential among younger generation. We always know theatre isn’t “real” – by playfully acknowledging that, the emotional impact is actually heightened. It’s a magic trick where understanding the trickery only makes the magic more real. HWAthol Fugard came to see that the righteous anger of didactic anti-apartheid drama was not as effective as the subversive laughter of the black townships when it came to getting across the harshness of the conditions there. Certainly, there is nothing moralising or solemn about this piece which was developed by Fugard from improvisations with the great John Kani and Winston Ntosha who first performed it. A mischievous shaggy dog story, it pulls the audience into an atmosphere of good-humoured sociability. Sizwe is a work-seeker in Port Elizabeth who can\u0027t get a job because he doesn\u0027t have a permit. It turns out that he has found a dead man\u0027s pass book and has substituted his own photo, killing off Sizwe Bansi. A deceptively light and humane play that outlasts the apartheid era. PT3340 Purgatory in Ingolstadt (1924)  Pioneers in Ingolstadt (1928), Marieluise FleisserMarieluise Fleisser, the author of these sorely neglected plays, was the lover, protégée, and victim of Bertolt Brecht, and her subject was the lower Bavarian city of her birth. The plays use a bold collage technique instead of linear narrative, and she had penetrating insights into its vicious pack mentality and conformist claustrophobia. In Purgatory, she evokes a stifling Catholic ethos: we see two very different rebels (one girl seeks in vain for an abortion) who suffer the humiliation of having to crawl back to the pack. Brecht effectively hijacked her second play Pioneers (about the contact between the inhabitants and a visiting squad of bridge-builders). He imposed overt anti-militarism and sensationalising sex, and Fleisser was denounced as a traitor to German womanhood. Stephen Daldry and Annie Castledine directed a superb version of these plays at the tiny Gate Theatre in 1991. Since when, nothing. It\u0027s high time Fleisser was given her due. PTTempting as it is to include Michael Frayn’s sublimely funny backstage farce, Noises Off, the more serious Copenhagen just pips it. It imagines a real meeting between nuclear physicists, the Dane Niels Bohr and German Werner Heisenberg, in Copenhagen in 1941, to discuss developments that will lead to the atomic bomb. Then he reimagines the meeting, and reimagines it again – after all, no-one really knows what happened. Was Heisenberg warning his old friend of the Nazis’ advances in nuclear weapons? Hoping for a mutual pact to prevent the atomic bomb? Seeking absolution? Looking at the unreliability of memory, the structure of Frayn’s play is cleverly animated by the scientific ideas his characters discuss: Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is the basis for its dramatic form. A big hit when it opened at the National, it went to the West End, Broadway – and wound up on TV, starring Daniel Craig. HWThis play was a theatrical explosion. Sarah Kane’s debut, written while she was a student, features a nasty tabloid journalist holed up in a Leeds hotel with a much younger woman, whom he sexually abuses. The world of the play – and its conventional theatrical form – is then blasted apart becoming a war zone: a soldier bursts in, explosions go off, and short scenes of grim horror unfold (stage directions include “he eats the baby”). Famously described as a “disgusting feast of filth”, Blasted was seen by critics as a puerile attempt to shock, and anointed as the classic example of provocative, Nineties in-yer-face theatre. But it’s since become canonical. It doesn’t seem to grow old: Kane’s writing has a horribly vivid energy, and the atrocities it depicts, depressingly, take on fresh resonance for each generation that discovers it. HWWho committed the first infidelity? Was it a man, or was it a woman? (You can bet it was a man who first thought of this prurient question.) The court in Marivaux\u0027s dark comedy thinks it has created the right laboratory conditions for finding out the answer. Four teenagers have been brought up in complete solitude and then are released into each other\u0027s company where their encounters will furnish “a most original entertainment” for the unseen Prince and his fiancée. The play incisively shows how easy it is to turn a stage into an experimental blank slate. But it feels a bit pervy – the Enlightenment\u0027s idea of reality television. Marivaux is elegantly conscious of the objections. There are razor blades secreted in the rococo décor of his works. PTIt\u0027s easy to make Pirandello sound like a forbiddingly cerebral writer. All his life he played tricksy games with philosophical problems such as the deceptiveness of identity. But his aim was to “to convert intellect into passion” and his best works succeed in doing so. Henry IV is about madness, the appearance of madness, and the consequence of deciding to become trapped within the appearance of madness. The protagonist is an Italian nobleman who falls from his horse at a pageant and comes round, convinced that he\u0027s the medieval German Emperor. For 20 years, he has been allowed to live this illusion, attended by flunkies in period-costume. But now comes an embassy bent on “shocking” him from this idee fixe. Richard Harris and Ian McDiarmid were the last pair to play Henry in the West End and they relished the chance to interweave the quizzicality and raw pain that the part requires. The predicament of the central character feels more tragicomically stimulating than far-fetched. PT3840 A Raisin in the Sun (1959), Lorraine HansberryThis play made history: the first on Broadway written by a black woman (shamefully, Britain wouldn’t have its equivalent – a play in the West End by a black British woman – until last year, with Natasha Gordon’s Nine Night). A Raisin in the Sun looks at the Youngers, an African-American family living in poverty in Chicago, dreaming of a better life – and fearing that their dreams will shrivel up like “a raisin in the sun”. Hansberry’s aching drama exhibits the same forceful tug as an Arthur Miller play, laying out how circumstances can crush hope. Its discussion of black identity, however, still crackles today – and the emotional punch that Hansberry’s script carries has drawn big names down the decade: Sidney Poitier starred in the premiere, and everyone from Denzel Washington to P Diddy has also had a crack. Hansberry died at only 34 one can’t help but wonder what other plays she might have had on this list. HWCaryl Churchill has been called the Picasso of modern playwrights. Today, at the age of 80, the British playwright continues startlingly to reinvent herself. Far Away is a twisted fairy tale that demonstrates her matchless gift for merging the apocalyptic and the fantastical. It unfolds in three episodes that shelve steeply. In the first, Joan is quizzing her aunt about what she has just accidentally witnessed. It sounds as if she has espied a bloody act of ethnic cleansing. Then the play escalates into a blackly hilarious vision of cosmic warfare. Partisan brutality has now spread from humans to the animal and mineral world. “The cats have come in on the side of the French,” someone says earnestly. The “natural goodness of deer has come through” says someone else. This is characteristic of Churchill, finding a brilliantly absurdist way of attacking the pernicious myth that there is a simple ide between virtue and evil, “them” and “us”. A sliver of genius. PTTom Stoppard sometimes gets accused of being all head and no heart – but this play proves otherwise. Yes, it’s a mind-achingly clever look at both science and art, pitting the rational against the romantic, while giving you mini lessons in chaos theory, the second law of thermodynamics and the life and shaggings of Lord Byron. But there’s a love story and a tragedy here, that in a well-calibrated production can be very moving. Two stories, set in the same country house, in 1809 and the present day, intersect and eventually overlap beautifully. The mathematic theorising forecasts hope as well as disaster for the universe, and the story offers the same for its characters. HWCalderon\u0027s play is one of the masterpieces of the Spanish Golden Age. The predicament of the young prince, Segismundo, calls to mind the Chinese sage\u0027s story of the man who dreams he is a butterfly and wakes to wonder whether he is actually a butterfly dreaming he is a man. This youth is at the mercy of political fluctuation: he\u0027s been imprisoned in a dark tower from birth because of a horoscope that predicted he would usurp the throne. Then, when there are anxieties about the succession, his father has him drugged, brought to the Palace, and bafflingly treated like a prince. A poetic piece that tackles deep metaphysical, political matters in a dazzlingly theatrical way. PTA play of astonishing breakthroughs. There had been plenty of soliloquies in Elizabethan drama beforehand. But no-one had ever talked to an audience like Hamlet. He doesn\u0027t just let you into his confidence, he lets you into his consciousness the best portrayals make you feel that you are soul-to-soul with this figure. It\u0027s his capacity for searching introspection that gets in the way and disqualifies Hamlet as a revenge hero: he\u0027s rather wonderfully miscast. Hamlet is brilliantly self-reflexive, constantly probing its own theatricality. The conscience of Claudius is tested by a play-within-a play Hamlet tries to fool the court by assuming an “antic disposition” that may at times waver into authentic madness. The piece is like a painful meditation on the contradicting meanings of the verb to “act” – to feign and to intervene. Inexhaustible. PTFeminism and expressionism collide in US playwright Sophie Treadwell\u0027s extraordinary vision of a mechanised, dehumanising metropolis. We feel the nerve-shredding racket of modern existence – described as “this purgatory of noise” – assaulting the Everywoman character at every stage as she makes her descent to doom. She\u0027s a stenographer, a sensitive cog in the machine who is blackmailed by her mother into marriage with a boss who revolts her, and ends up condemned to the electric chair for murdering him. Treadwell\u0027s nagging dialogue, with its jangly staccato and syncopated telegraphese, uncannily anticipates Harold Pinter and David Mamet. Her cry against institutionalised misogyny – “I will not submit” – resounds down the ages. PTIn Gogol\u0027s great phantasmagoric farce, an impecunious clerk newly arrived from St Petersburg is mistakenly assumed to be the eponymous inspector by the corrupt mayor and officials of this provincial town. Panic drives these paranoid locals to project a false identity onto this stranger. That would have been a good enough joke. Gogol, though, gives it an inspired, twist. His penniless nonenity turns out to be driven by an equivalent dread of being recognised as one of life\u0027s losers. So when he twigs to their exploitable mistake, he treats their absurd respect (not to mention their bribes) as long-overdue recognition of his true worth and becomes airborne with grandiosity. It\u0027s the interlocking lunacies that generate the comic delirium in this Russian masterpiece. PTOne of Pinter\u0027s most haunting and unnerving pieces. A married couple, Kate and Deeley, play games of power and possessiveness with the wife\u0027s former flatmate, Anna, who comes to visit for the first time in 20 years. The piece is horribly preoccupied with the use people make of selective – and conceivably invented – memories as weapon or way of gaining the upper hand. We mint memories, in this understanding of it, in response to the psychological needs of the moment: “There are things I remember which may never have happened, but as I recall them.” Deeley is threatened by Anna\u0027s youthful relationship to his wife and strongly attracted to the newcomer. There’s a wonderful evocation of rackety London when the girls lived as secretaries, but the uneasy comedy of all this turns lethal. PTThe best Jacobean tragedy outside Shakespeare, The Changeling also seems to anticipate film noir. The heroine hires a shady type to bump off her fiance. This villain has a facial disfigurement, but the piece is alert to how perversely attracted we are to what repels us. The assassin demands her virginity as his blood-money and the slide into shadowy corruption becomes inexorable. There is a subplot in a madhouse that is designed as a distorted mirror of the main action in its obsession with disguise, lunacy, and sex. PTThis Pulitzer-winning American playwright explores the history of her great-grandmother in early 20th century New York. Esther is a black seamstress – unmarried and illiterate – who sews ravishingly beautiful garments for other women to wear on their wedding nights. She gets what could be a last chance of happiness but it\u0027s destroyed in circumstances that are never sentimentalised. The sensual feel of fine fabric (her means of supporting and expressing herself) is conveyed with gorgeous descriptive power. Intimate Apparel manages to be uplifting without ever losing its irreverent humour. PTSophocles\u0027s play is still the most powerful ever written about the conflict between our obligations to the state and our duty to the ties of kinship. Antigone defies her uncle Kreon, the new ruler of Thebes, by burying her brother Polyneikes. He had brought an army against his native city and Kreon, in these politically volatile times, wants his corpse left for the dogs as an exemplary desecration. The philosopher Hegel saw this as the quintessence of true tragedy: not a conflict between good and evil, but between right and right. In fact, productions nowadays tend to come down in favour of Antigone and her self-sacrificing intransigence. PTRichard Bean had the inspired idea of transposing Goldoni\u0027s 18th century commedia dell\u0027arte romp from Venice to Brighton in 1963. Our jack-the-lad hero – frantically trying to hold down a pair of jobs, unbeknownst to either boss – is a failed skiffle player. The complications are deliciously warped. One character does a bunk to Brighton disguised as her psychotic twin brother who has been bumped off by her posh twit of a boyfriend in a gangland brawl. Still with me? The dialogue is naughty and knowing, but there\u0027s a terrific innocent joy to the physical clowning which peaks in the delirious sequence where our hero has to dish up lunch to the two masters at the same time. PTA supreme example of how a writer can make a play by putting together a triptych of miniatures. Holman was brought up in the pacifist tradition and Making Noise Quietly looks at the long-range effects of war in three chance encounters. In the first, set in a Kent field in 1943, a northern Quaker and an uninhibited London aesthete discuss their reasons for not fighting. In the second, a naval officer arrives to tell a mother of her son’s death in the Falklands War. The third is set in the Black Forest in 1986. An English private, gone AWOL with his disturbed eight-year-old stepson, come into testing collision with a rich German businesswoman who survived the Holocaust. There\u0027s a stunning scene in which she draws the little boy out of his dogmatic mutism by her repeated, stern insistence that he says “thank you” it\u0027s uplifing in the end but it\u0027s not pretty. Writing of rare sensitivity and cumulative power. PTThough he described it as “the lightest of light comedies”, Private Lives is the Noel Coward play that one would undoubtedly preserve for posterity. He wrote it as a vehicle for himself and Gertrude Lawrence, with indecent speed. The play centres on two orcees who, five years after their split, bump into each other on adjacent hotel balconies while on the first night of honeymoons with their new spouses. An elegantly contrived coincidence followed by a pattern of cheekily reversed expectations: most comedies end in marriage this one begins with nobbled nuptials as the couple unceremoniously ditch their second partners and abscond to Paris together. Elyot and Amanda are the kind of flighty egotistical couple that can neither live together nor apart. Anti-romantic comedy soaked in sex (and romance): “Don\u0027t quibble Sybil.” PT1240 Angels in America (1990-93), Tony KushnerSubtitled “A Gay Fantasia on National Themes”, Tony Kushner\u0027s astonishing two-part play is set in the AIDS crisis of the mid-1980s during the right wing administration of Ronald Reagan. The word AIDS was never mentioned by the President, and the struggle to find a cure was hampered by a lack of government recognition. Kushner retaliated by putting gay men centre stage in an epic that shows them fighting to forge their private and public destinies. This is, however, very far from a conventional “issue” play in its glorious ambition. The piece rages from Antarctica and the damaged ozone layer to a baroque heaven that god has abandoned. Prophetic angels crash through ceilings. There are “mutual dream” sequences where people wander in and out of each other\u0027 fantasies. The presiding demon of the piece is one of drama\u0027s greatest monsters: the incorrigible and shameless Roy Cohn was a real-life Republican fixer (and mentor to the young Donald Trump). PTA middle-aged woman is buried in a mound of earth first up to the waist then, after the interval, up to the neck. It is a sight that has never lost its capacity to startle. Beckett\u0027s Winnie prattles away dogged with optimism (“This will have been another happy day”) in a loquacious attempt to stave off hysteria and despair at her encroaching fate. Partly irritating, partly heroic, she brings forth a dotty lyrical monologue that\u0027s threaded with genteel half-remembered wisps from the “immortal” classics. Peter Hall, who directed Peggy Ashcroft in the part, rightly pointed out that “Beckett\u0027s theatre is as much about mime and physical precision as it is about words”. Except that his texts are great and this one is superb beyond belief. To quote Winnie: “What is that unforgettable line?” PT1440  Long Day’s Journey into Night (1940), Eugene O NeillWhen O\u0027Neill described Long Day\u0027s Journey as a “play of old sorrow, written in blood and tears”, he was barely exaggerating. This enormous autobiographical drama is so raw and unremitting in its revelations about his dysfunctional Irish-Catholic family that the author left instructions – mercifully disobeyed by his widow – that the play was not to be performed until 25 years after his death. You can understand the trepidation. Long Day\u0027s Journey plunges deep into the tortured heart of the Tyrones – James, the acclaimed actor who sold out to commercial success, his wife Mary who has recently relapsed into morphine addiction, and their two sons. When the play is under the baton of the right director, it\u0027s the like listening to the recapitulations in a great piece of music. You emerge drained but in a state of elating catharsis. PTHector wants to teach boys knowledge that will last them a lifetime. But the headmaster has become obsessed with government league tables and has hired Irwin to teach them glib, exam-passing techniques. That\u0027s the clash at the heart of Alan Bennett\u0027s hugely popular hit. It\u0027s set at a Yorkshire grammar amongst a group of clever sixth-formers. As with a lot of Bennett\u0027s work you can discern a revue-like structure in the play\u0027s glorious string of skits, gags, songs and sheer elating silliness. But it\u0027s also a brilliant portrait of a maverick teacher. The scene in which the doomed Hector analyses the Hardy poem “Drummer Hodge” with his pupil Posner is unsurpassed in drama as an example of humane teaching. Gay, unhappy Posner also has the play\u0027s best joke: “I\u0027m a Jew. I\u0027m small. I\u0027m homosexual. And I live in Sheffield. I\u0027m fucked.” PTFrank Hardy, an itinerant Irish faith healer, his wife, and his manager tell four monologues that contradict each other, leaving the audience to question truth and memory, lies and storytelling. Frank struggles to understand his own “gift”, and how his ability to cure comes and goes Faith Healer is also a parable about the artist and his inspiration. The play foundered when it opened on Broadway, but has since been recognised as a modern classic: in a good production, there’s a trembling sort of power to it. Friel’s writing can be rhythmical, incantatory, but it’s also gorgeously subtle. Although Friel throughout maintains a – crucial – ambivalence, the play attains a sort of transcendent grace of its own. HWPlays by this American writer tend to be long, slow – and strangely riveting. It’s hard to pin down what exactly makes John so bewitching. It is set in a kitschy, tat-filled Gettysburg guesthouse, where a fighting young couple interact with the dotty landlady and her blind but visionary friend. The house seems haunted: creepy dolls and pianos start playing themselves. But it’s also haunted by history (it was a civil war hospital), and by the older women’s memories of love, ghosts, and their own mystical experiences. All of this is a little spooky, but also rather emotionally stirring. Baker is also super sharp on the millennial couple’s dying relationship, which opens out into a look at how it’s often women who have to prop up men’s myths, to feed their needy hunger. HWFrom “I have always depended on the kindness of strangers” to “Stellaaaaaa”, Williams’s play has entered the popular consciousness. As well it might: there’s something eternal in its themes of loss, ageing, and the lies we live by. Fear and lust rub up against each other, sweatily few other writers have captured the heat of the South like Williams, and this is the playwright at his most atmospheric. Blanche DuBois – the deluded southern belle who shacks up with her sister and her macho, abusive husband – is a summit part for an actress, and everyone from Vivien Leigh to Tallulah Bankhead, Cate Blanchett to Gillian Anderson have had a go. HWThe only surviving full trilogy of Greek tragedies, through Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides Aeschylus traces the impact of violence and revenge down a Royal family, throwing questions of justice and duty into sharp relief. To win the Trojan war, Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter the trilogy opens with a play in which his wife Clytemnestra kills him to avenge her daughter’s death. In Libation Bearers, Clytemnestra’s son Orestes murders her in retaliation (if Antigone is a tragedy because it’s a conflict between right and right, this is perhaps a clash between wrong and wrong). The cycle is broken in Eumenides, where the gods form a court in which to try Orestes. It’s juicy, meaty, high-octane stuff – and has been given era-defining productions both in Peter Hall masked version at the National in 1981, and in Robert Icke’s crisp modern adaptation in 2015. HWPart of the playwright’s cycle exploring the African-American experience in 20th century American –  a play for each decade – this chapter is set in a Chicago recording studio in 1927. Ma Rainey, the “mother of the blues”, is slow to show up to record some tunes. Instead, we watch her band kill time and spar with one another. Although it all lands light as a butterfly, the script is stinging on subjects such as ambition and race relations. Ma Rainey, when she arrives, proves worth waiting for: an immense, haughty presence. There’s a twist towards the end, giving the play punch – plus the tunes are great, of course. HWIbsen wrote great women: we could have gone for Hedda Gabler. But A Doll’s House is one of those plays with a wide significance: written in 1879, it’s a proto-feminist text. When our troubled heroine Nora slams the door at the end of the play, it’s not just on her patronising husband, but on the whole of The Patriarchy. The play shocked some in its portrayal of a woman made so desperate by her suffocating domestic situation that she abandons her children as well as her husband, choosing freedom and self-actualistion over the prison of the home. Of course, things have changed for women since, but this exceptionally controlled play still unfolds perfectly – and that slam still resonates. HWYou could make a case for any of Chekhov’s plays really (we nearly went for his early, entertaining Platonov, just to be different) but the lucidity of The Seagull wins out. It’s got more plot, a sliver less ennui, than some of his others: a young man, Konstantin, longs to be a playwright his narcissistic mother Arkadina – an actress – is wrapped up in her new boyfriend, Trigorin, a successful novelist. He in turn romances Nina, Konstantin’s girlfriend and an aspiring actress. It’s not much of a spoiler to say none of their dreams exactly come true, life proving endlessly, exquisitely disappointing. The Seagull is a mordant comedy – scenes skewering both Arkadina’s monstrous ego and her son’s attempts at avant garde art are some of the best bits of theatre-about-theatre ever. But there’s also an unbearable tenderness to the play’s portrayal of young love, hope, and idealism. HW2340  Mother Courage and Her Children (1939), Bertolt Brecht Few, if any, playwrights of the 20th century had as much of an impact on theatre as Brecht: he wanted art to be a political tool rather than escapist entertainment, but also revolutionised theatrical form and style, doing away with naturalism. But it can mean his “epic theatre” is still associated with didacticism, rather than drama. Not so Mother Courage, though, which is epic in both senses: written after Hitler invaded Poland, but set during the Thirty-Years\u0027 War, it is a potent story of one mother’s attempts to profit from conflict, and the huge cost war always takes in the end. HWBased on the Greek myth where Medea kills her children in order to get revenge on her unfaithful husband, this tragedy has lost none of its force – or power to shock. But the text allows more sympathetic readings Medea too, as a woman fighting for justice in an unjust world. With a monumental lead part, and a chorus who react and comment on the action, the play has always been one of the most popular of the Greek tragedies. Taut and tense, you see the horror coming but feel desperately compelled to look. HWThe mother of a murdered child. Her imprisoned paedophile killer. A criminal psychologist attempting to understand what drove him to do it. Through first monologues, and then dialogue, this modem classic has much to say about the extremes of human anguish, but also our capacity for change, and for forgiveness. It’s a dark and thorny work, but a deeply humane one too, by a prolific British writer at her best. HW2640 The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), Oscar Wilde Has there every been such a reliably delightful comedy? The improbable plot of tangled engagements, lost handbags, invented wicked relatives, and real monstrous aunts runs like clockwork. There are innumerable blissful one-liners, the characters are delicious upper-class twits, and at every turn Wilde has a fine old time pricking societal niceties. It’s frothy fun, and funny froth, and always invites larger-than-life performances. Being so very bankable has led to Wilde’s play certainly being over-staged and it now feels thoroughly un-urgent – and then it makes you laugh all over again. HWSherman’s harrowing play pulls the rug from under you. You invest in the relationship between Max and Rudy, a decadent gay couple in Berlin in 1934 – but after the Night of the Long Knives they flee, before being caught and sent to Dachau. On the way, Max’s desire to survive produces sickening betrayal. He pretends to be Jewish rather than gay, but in the camp meets Horst, a man who reveals the honour in being true to one’s self. There’s an astonishing scene where – forbidden to touch – they have sex purely through words. Ian McKellen originally played Max, but Richard Gere and Alan Cummings have also taken on the role in what is now seen as seminal gay text – one that proves truth and love may flower in the most horrific, hopeless circumstances. HWAh, the transformative power of theatre… This familiar idea is irresistibly proven by Wertenbaker’s oft-revived play, based on a true story about a group of convicts in an Australian penal colony who put on a production of George Farquhar’s The Recruiting Officer. It has fun sending up the pretensions of theatre, but ultimately uses it as means for talking about empathy, communication, and understanding, as relations between the reviled prisoners and the cruel officers thaw. A direct piece of storytelling with a huge heart. HWLucy Prebble made her name with ENRON, charting the hubris of the financial giant, but while it may be less flashy, The Effect is still dazzlingly good. It has, at its heart, a question we’d all like to know the answer to: what is love? The play follows two volunteers in a clinical trial for a new anti-depressant when they fall for each other, they wonder whether their love is “real”, or a by-product. And given all interactions in the brain are just chemical, does it even matter? The idea of what’s really real and what’s really romantic, what happiness is and what function unhappiness might have, are turned over by Prebble’s own very sharp mind. Her characters are fun to spend time with, her dialogue is snappy, but she digs deep too, into both scientific theories and human emotions, taking us from the grey lows of depression to the technicolour highs of new love. HWIt can be hard to separate this play from an animating original performance by the great Mark Rylance, who played Johnny “Rooster” Byron – a wild misfit who lives in a caravan in the woods in rural England, gathering local young people to him like some kind of drink-and-drug-fuelled pied piper. Such a summary might sound tawdry, yet set on St George’s Day and ripe with Rooster’s storytelling, it has a mythic, mystical quality. A state-of-the-nation show powered by anti-establishment brio, it also precisely captures a contemporary rural community (very sweary, and very funny). Jerusalem became a ridiculously big hit, with audiences camping out round the theatre for tickets. But a recent revival suggests the play can still crow, whoever plays Rooster. HWWhat makes a great play? A lot of critics, academics, and playwrights themselves will point to form matching content. On this, Tim Crouch’s glitteringly clever play really delivers – while also being extremely moving. A stage hypnotist encounters the father of a girl he killed in a car accident. The father truly believes his daughter has been transformed into oak tree. At every performance, the father is played by an actor who’s never seen or read the play before they are given a script or fed lines by – yes – the hypnotist (played initially by Crouch himself, also acknowledging his “real” role as the playwright). The actor is transformed before us we accept that they are now the father. An Oak Tree has a radical honesty which has made it hugely influential among younger generation. We always know theatre isn’t “real” – by playfully acknowledging that, the emotional impact is actually heightened. It’s a magic trick where understanding the trickery only makes the magic more real. HWAthol Fugard came to see that the righteous anger of didactic anti-apartheid drama was not as effective as the subversive laughter of the black townships when it came to getting across the harshness of the conditions there. Certainly, there is nothing moralising or solemn about this piece which was developed by Fugard from improvisations with the great John Kani and Winston Ntosha who first performed it. A mischievous shaggy dog story, it pulls the audience into an atmosphere of good-humoured sociability. Sizwe is a work-seeker in Port Elizabeth who can\u0027t get a job because he doesn\u0027t have a permit. It turns out that he has found a dead man\u0027s pass book and has substituted his own photo, killing off Sizwe Bansi. A deceptively light and humane play that outlasts the apartheid era. PT3340 Purgatory in Ingolstadt (1924)  Pioneers in Ingolstadt (1928), Marieluise FleisserMarieluise Fleisser, the author of these sorely neglected plays, was the lover, protégée, and victim of Bertolt Brecht, and her subject was the lower Bavarian city of her birth. The plays use a bold collage technique instead of linear narrative, and she had penetrating insights into its vicious pack mentality and conformist claustrophobia. In Purgatory, she evokes a stifling Catholic ethos: we see two very different rebels (one girl seeks in vain for an abortion) who suffer the humiliation of having to crawl back to the pack. Brecht effectively hijacked her second play Pioneers (about the contact between the inhabitants and a visiting squad of bridge-builders). He imposed overt anti-militarism and sensationalising sex, and Fleisser was denounced as a traitor to German womanhood. Stephen Daldry and Annie Castledine directed a superb version of these plays at the tiny Gate Theatre in 1991. Since when, nothing. It\u0027s high time Fleisser was given her due. PTTempting as it is to include Michael Frayn’s sublimely funny backstage farce, Noises Off, the more serious Copenhagen just pips it. It imagines a real meeting between nuclear physicists, the Dane Niels Bohr and German Werner Heisenberg, in Copenhagen in 1941, to discuss developments that will lead to the atomic bomb. Then he reimagines the meeting, and reimagines it again – after all, no-one really knows what happened. Was Heisenberg warning his old friend of the Nazis’ advances in nuclear weapons? Hoping for a mutual pact to prevent the atomic bomb? Seeking absolution? Looking at the unreliability of memory, the structure of Frayn’s play is cleverly animated by the scientific ideas his characters discuss: Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is the basis for its dramatic form. A big hit when it opened at the National, it went to the West End, Broadway – and wound up on TV, starring Daniel Craig. HWThis play was a theatrical explosion. Sarah Kane’s debut, written while she was a student, features a nasty tabloid journalist holed up in a Leeds hotel with a much younger woman, whom he sexually abuses. The world of the play – and its conventional theatrical form – is then blasted apart becoming a war zone: a soldier bursts in, explosions go off, and short scenes of grim horror unfold (stage directions include “he eats the baby”). Famously described as a “disgusting feast of filth”, Blasted was seen by critics as a puerile attempt to shock, and anointed as the classic example of provocative, Nineties in-yer-face theatre. But it’s since become canonical. It doesn’t seem to grow old: Kane’s writing has a horribly vivid energy, and the atrocities it depicts, depressingly, take on fresh resonance for each generation that discovers it. HWWho committed the first infidelity? Was it a man, or was it a woman? (You can bet it was a man who first thought of this prurient question.) The court in Marivaux\u0027s dark comedy thinks it has created the right laboratory conditions for finding out the answer. Four teenagers have been brought up in complete solitude and then are released into each other\u0027s company where their encounters will furnish “a most original entertainment” for the unseen Prince and his fiancée. The play incisively shows how easy it is to turn a stage into an experimental blank slate. But it feels a bit pervy – the Enlightenment\u0027s idea of reality television. Marivaux is elegantly conscious of the objections. There are razor blades secreted in the rococo décor of his works. PTIt\u0027s easy to make Pirandello sound like a forbiddingly cerebral writer. All his life he played tricksy games with philosophical problems such as the deceptiveness of identity. But his aim was to “to convert intellect into passion” and his best works succeed in doing so. Henry IV is about madness, the appearance of madness, and the consequence of deciding to become trapped within the appearance of madness. The protagonist is an Italian nobleman who falls from his horse at a pageant and comes round, convinced that he\u0027s the medieval German Emperor. For 20 years, he has been allowed to live this illusion, attended by flunkies in period-costume. But now comes an embassy bent on “shocking” him from this idee fixe. Richard Harris and Ian McDiarmid were the last pair to play Henry in the West End and they relished the chance to interweave the quizzicality and raw pain that the part requires. The predicament of the central character feels more tragicomically stimulating than far-fetched. PT3840 A Raisin in the Sun (1959), Lorraine HansberryThis play made history: the first on Broadway written by a black woman (shamefully, Britain wouldn’t have its equivalent – a play in the West End by a black British woman – until last year, with Natasha Gordon’s Nine Night). A Raisin in the Sun looks at the Youngers, an African-American family living in poverty in Chicago, dreaming of a better life – and fearing that their dreams will shrivel up like “a raisin in the sun”. Hansberry’s aching drama exhibits the same forceful tug as an Arthur Miller play, laying out how circumstances can crush hope. Its discussion of black identity, however, still crackles today – and the emotional punch that Hansberry’s script carries has drawn big names down the decade: Sidney Poitier starred in the premiere, and everyone from Denzel Washington to P Diddy has also had a crack. Hansberry died at only 34 one can’t help but wonder what other plays she might have had on this list. HWCaryl Churchill has been called the Picasso of modern playwrights. Today, at the age of 80, the British playwright continues startlingly to reinvent herself. Far Away is a twisted fairy tale that demonstrates her matchless gift for merging the apocalyptic and the fantastical. It unfolds in three episodes that shelve steeply. In the first, Joan is quizzing her aunt about what she has just accidentally witnessed. It sounds as if she has espied a bloody act of ethnic cleansing. Then the play escalates into a blackly hilarious vision of cosmic warfare. Partisan brutality has now spread from humans to the animal and mineral world. “The cats have come in on the side of the French,” someone says earnestly. The “natural goodness of deer has come through” says someone else. This is characteristic of Churchill, finding a brilliantly absurdist way of attacking the pernicious myth that there is a simple ide between virtue and evil, “them” and “us”. A sliver of genius. PTTom Stoppard sometimes gets accused of being all head and no heart – but this play proves otherwise. Yes, it’s a mind-achingly clever look at both science and art, pitting the rational against the romantic, while giving you mini lessons in chaos theory, the second law of thermodynamics and the life and shaggings of Lord Byron. But there’s a love story and a tragedy here, that in a well-calibrated production can be very moving. Two stories, set in the same country house, in 1809 and the present day, intersect and eventually overlap beautifully. The mathematic theorising forecasts hope as well as disaster for the universe, and the story offers the same for its characters.

Two consecutive quarters of contraction are typically defined as a recession.The contraction between April and June was mostly driven by sinking demand from abroad, the Bundesbank said. Exports “were down substantially”, it noted, as pre-Brexit preparations ahead of the UK’s initial exit date at the end of March prompted companies to build up stocks in the first quarter.“As things currently stand, it is unclear whether exports and, by extension, industry will regain their footing before the domestic economy becomes more severely affected,” the Bundesbank said.Appetite for German cars and other goods has also waned in China as growth in the world’s second-largest economy is cooling, partly due to the year-long trade war with the US.Up until a week ago, economists surveyed by Bloomberg were predicting\u0026nbspthat Germany’s economy will grow by 0.2 per cent in the current quarter.But since then big-name institutions including Deutsche Bank have lowered their expectations. The concern for many analysts is that continuing global trade tensions will prolong the downturn in German manufacturing and eventually feed through to the still-strong services sector.The central bank’s forecast follows weeks of disappointing economic data and news of meagre earnings at German companies. The government has signalled that it might be willing to step up spending should the downturn worsen.The European Central Bank is also considering providing extra monetary stimulus to the wider euro zone.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But has the rise and fall and rise again of James Charles turned the tide on influencer culture, asks Sirena Bergman, or shone a light on how much we love watching celebrities fall from grace?Click to followThe IndependentLast month, Time magazine released its list of the 25 most influential people on the internet. Nestled among politicians, royals and activists of household-name status are hugely popular YouTubers many may not have heard of. The endlessly relatable Emma Chamberlain, with over 8 million subscribers, features. As does 16-year-old tween sensation and former Dance Moms star JoJo Siwa, with almost 10 million followers.And then you come to the name James Charles, who up until this spring was relatively unknown to the masses, despite more than 16 million people subscribing to his YouTube channel. Like many influencers, he existed in a curious celebrity middle-ground, where despite being mobbed by thousands of adoring fans, the traditional media pretty much completely ignored him. But all that changed on 10 May, when fellow YouTuber and former friend Tati Westbrook uploaded a 43-minute video which can broadly be described as a character assassination of Charles, kickstarting what would become one of the most talked-about, consequential feuds in influencer history.The making of James CharlesTo understand the monumental cultural impact of the dispute, we must go back to 5 September 2016, when a relatively unknown 17-year-old James Charles Dickinson, who had built up a\u0026nbspmodest following by\u0026nbspfilming make-up tutorials on YouTube for under a year, tweeted his senior yearbook picture. He explained that he’d had the photos retaken with his ringlight\u0026nbsp“so my highlight would be poppin” because he loves “being extra”.\u0026nbspThe photo went viral and racked up more than 33,000 retweets and 84,000 likes on Twitter within just a day, including a retweet from then 20-year-old actor and singer Zendaya. By the following month he’d amassed more than 440,000 Instagram followers and was announced as the first male ambassador for US make-up brand CoverGirl. It was widely acknowledged as a pivotal moment for LGBT+ inclusivity and the beauty industry abandoning the gender stereotyping which it had been propagating for decades.\u0026nbspSuch was the impact of Charles’s story that he was invited on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to talk to the LGBT+ icon about his story. He appeared in a full face of make-up, discussing his sudden rise to internet fame, coming\u0026nbspout as gay aged 12, becoming interested in make-up and growing up on social media. Born in 1999, he was only five years old when Facebook was founded, seven when Twitter launched, and 11 when the first version of Instagram was released.\u0026nbspCoverGirl (James CharlesTwitter)His viral fame became emblematic of a generation of creators and celebrities whose careers took off on social media. Musician Billie Eilish, who was born in 2001, has achieved worldwide fame after the huge success of her single “Ocean Eyes”, which she posted on SoundCloud. Fellow singer Lil Nas X broke records this year when, aged 19, his song\u0026nbsp“Old Town Road”\u0026nbspbecame the longest-running hip-hop track on the Billboard Hot 100 after going viral on the video-sharing app TikTok. YouTuber Tana Mongeau found herself on real-life billboards all over LA this year after landing an MTV reality show based on the run-up to her 21st birthday. But Charles’s sudden fame landed him in a wholly different world.The top tier of beauty YouTubers is a place of fame, wealth and tremendous influence, punctuated by collaborations with the likes of Kim Kardashian, partnerships with behemoths of the make-up industry and incestuous, cliquey friendship groups that result in feuds and dramas that are all closely covered by commentary channels on YouTube, which are watched by millions.Everything wrong with the James Charles–Tati Westbrook controversyCharles’s meteoric rise to the top of this exclusive club has been uniquely defined by seemingly endless scandals. In February 2017 he was forced to apologise after a tweet in which he joked about getting Ebola while on a school trip to Africa. Just a few months later, fellow beauty influencer Thomas Halbert posted screenshots of conversations which seemed to discredit the ringlight story that led to Charles’s fame, suggesting he actually photoshopped his “poppin” highlight. In April 2019 he caught flak yet again after saying in a video that he was not “full gay” because he had been “into” trans guys, suggesting that they did not count as men for the purpose of identifying his sexuality.The following month he was widely ridiculed for posting on Instagram that his invitation to the Met Gala was “a step in the right direction for influencer representation in the media” and that he was glad to be the “catalyst”.\u0026nbspWhile his comments were somewhat tone-deaf and self-aggrandising as someone with such huge privilege, it’s true that the media and fashion industry\u0026nbsptend to ignore social media influencers in favour of covering more traditional celebrities, leading to a disconnect between the reality of their huge impact and lack of awareness among the masses.This was epitomised in January when Charles made an appearance at a shopping centre in Birmingham and thousands of fans brought the city centre to a standstill, much to the surprise of officials who clearly failed to understand the scope of his influence and plan accordingly.Charles’s wish to be acknowledged by the mainstream would soon be granted, but in a cruel twist of fate it would not be for his success, but for the projected death of his career.The cancelling of James CharlesTati Westbrook is a 37-year-old beauty YouTuber. She has been on the platform since 2010, and for much of that time was posting five videos a week, mostly focusing on product reviews and tutorials. Over almost a decade, she amassed more than 6 million subscribers and is widely respected on the platform for her perceived authenticity (unlike most influencers, she rarely accepts brand sponsorships) and ability to stay out of the drama despite her\u0026nbsppublic friendships with controversial figures such as Jeffree Star. Newsweek referred to her as “a progenitor of YouTube’s beauty scene” and indeed that is how she was broadly perceived among the community.So people were inclined to not only listen, but also blindly believe her allegations when she posted her now-infamous 43-minute video entitled “Bye Sister”\u0026nbsp– the title being a reference to Charles’s trademark term for his subscribers (“Hi sisters!”), his friends (“I’m doing a collaboration with sister Jeffree Star!”), and pretty much any word in his vocabulary (he’s going to put on a “sister winged liner”, his day is “sister stressful”, he gives people he likes a “sister shoutout”).Westbrook’s video (which has since been deleted) was ostensibly triggered by Charles accepting a sponsorship from vitamin supplement brand Sugar Bear Hair (SBH), which many – including Westbrook – saw as a betrayal of their friendship given the company is the main competitor to her supplement business Halo Beauty.\u0026nbspvlogger\u0026nbspin Birmingham: fans brought the city centre to a standstill, much to the surprise of officials, who had not prepared to accommodate them\u0026nbsp(James CharlesTwitter)Her response was, by most measures, brutal. It detailed how much she and her husband had done for Charles, acting as parents to the teenager, offering business and personal advice, helping him gain popularity and sponsorships, taking him under their wing. She discredited his story that he had to take the partnership with SBH because the brand had saved him from being mobbed at Coachella, and criticised him for promoting supplements to a young audience. She also made allegations of sexual misconduct, claiming Charles systematically tried to “convince straight men that they were gay” and was consistently inappropriate and coercive around men who were not interested in him.Posting the video was a risky move by Westbrook, who throughout it emphasised how much she “still cared” about her former friend. She has since stated that she had no idea how drastic the reaction would be, despite the loyalty of Charles’s audience, which was much larger than hers.\u0026nbspIt’s hard to imagine that anyone could have predicted what happened next – the video received millions of views, was on YouTube’s trending page, and subscribers started flocking away from Charles and towards Westbrook at record-breaking speed.\u0026nbspTati Westbrook during the now-deleted 43-minute video entitled ‘Bye Sister’ in which she details the allegations against her ‘former friend’ James Charles\u0026nbsp(TatiYouTube)Within a day he had lost 1 million subscribers – something that had never before occurred in the 14-year history of YouTube – Westbrook was simultaneously gaining hundreds of thousands of subscribers at lighting speed.\u0026nbspThis mass exodus continued for days and the feud was covered across\u0026nbspmedia outlets. Charles posted\u0026nbspa teary apology video\u0026nbspand other high-profile figures weighed in, including comments from huge influencers including Manny MUA in defence of Charles, and Jeffree Star backing Westbrook. Within days the race was on to see who would hit 10 million subscribers first – Charles, who began at 16 million, or Westbrook, who just days before was at 6 million.The story became a global talking point. People who had never watched a make-up tutorial in their lives were weighing in, and Charles was largely declared “cancelled”.Herd mentality and social media mob ruleThe YouTube community has been mired in scandals for years. Last summer\u0026nbspa wave of top-tier influencers (with Star at the centre of it) were called out for inappropriate content and behaviour Logan Paul, with 15 million subscribers, vlogged the dead body of a suicide victim for a video his brother Jake Paul (19 million subscribers) posted a video in which his YouTube nemesis FaZe Banks was falsely accused of assault Tana Mongeau (4.7 million subscribers) hosted a convention so disastrously organised that it left fans waiting outside for hours in blistering sun with no food or water creators including Shane Dawson (22 million subscribers) and Philip DeFranco (6.4 million subscribers) were accused of exploiting their followers’ mental health concerns for money after promoting the controversial BetterHelp app. Yet none of these situations came close to creating the kind of backlash Charles experienced.Hollie-Anne Brooks is a journalist and former editor of We The Unicorns, a digital publication that covers YouTuber news. She thinks that while Westbrook’s video kickstarted the backlash against Charles, it snowballed into a collective desire to be involved in the drama, which led many to follow in the footsteps of his first critics without questioning the reasons for doing so.“There were a lot of people who enjoyed getting caught up in the #JamesCharlesIsCancelled movement and it felt like you were part of a group,” she says.Katie Woodland is a psychologist who now works as a business coach, but her background is in child development. She believes that part of the reason for the extreme response to the scandal is the age of the subscribers involved.“When you’re a teenager you’re desperately looking for an identity and a tribe. Initially James Charles spoke to that need, being an outsider himself,” says Woodland. “The cliques and groups we pick as teenagers are part of us trying to work out where we belong and as soon as we align with someone, we feel they are an extension of our identity, but if they say or do something we feel doesn’t align with our world view, teenagers can feel truly betrayed, and want to hurt them back.”SBH and Westbrook’s story where she indicated she was upset about his post, but didn’t name him (Instagram)Woodland explains that due to the increased exposure to influencers’ day-to-day lives, younger generations can feel that they are within their orbit, compared to the more removed sense of fandom for traditional celebrities. As a result, the reaction can be as intense as if you were to fall out with a friend. Followers may also feel a connection to Westbrook, so by claiming Charles betrayed her, her younger viewers could empathise so deeply that they took Charles’s alleged actions personally.Research bears this out, showing that the brain isn’t fully developed until around age 25. According to the University of Rochester Medical Centre, adults think with the prefrontal cortex, the brain’s rational part. This is the region\u0026nbspof the brain that responds to situations with good judgment and an awareness of long-term consequences. Whereas teens process information with the amygdala, which governs emotions. As a result, young people are more likely to succumb to a “herd mentality”.Nicola Morgan is a psychologist who has spent decades researching the teenage brain. In her book The Teenage Guide to Friends, she writes that this phenomenon can lead to problematic behaviours. “Groups (including groups of adults) often react and behave emotionally, without thinking. The iniduals may hardly register that they’ve hurt anyone by their laughter, exclusion or thoughtless comments.”Tati Westbrook following scandalShe also writes that social media can exacerbate this behaviour in people of all ages “because of the ‘online disinhibition effect’, which describes how people often behave online in a way they wouldn’t do face-to-face. Group behaviour on social media causes problems for adults, too, as people of any age can behave badly, be cruel and have poor self-control.”He argues that part of the reason people feel comfortable “ganging up” on someone on social media is that it has become a comfortable echochamber for our own opinions. “Twitter’s like a sort of mutual approval machine,” he says.\u0026nbsp“Tech utopians call this a new type of democracy but it’s the opposite. In a democracy, you listen to each other.”YouTuber who\u0026nbspfaced worldwide scorn after uploading a controversial video in Japan’s suicide forest (Getty)The desire to surround ourselves by people who validate our views existed long before social media, but platforms like YouTube, Twitter and Instagram certainly exacerbate it. Writing in Psychology Today, moral psychologist Rob Henderson states that: “There is a heuristic most of us use to determine what to do, think, say, and buy: the principle of social proof. To learn what is correct, we look at what other people are doing.”The impulse to be part of a vindicated group – in this case, the people “cancelling” James Charles – is compounded by the unparalleled visibility of the sentiment. Social media analytics site Social Blade was live-streaming the subscriber differential for Charles and Westbrook, allowing viewers to watch Charles’s fall from grace in real time, and contributing to a collective mentality which lacked awareness of the potential nuance in the feudBrooks says that watching Charles’s subscriber count go down was “a meme and a moment on social media in itself”.Created with Sketch.Youtube\u0027s top 15 most subscribed channels in 2019 Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The YouTube channel homepage for Indian record label T-Series, which overtook controversial Swedish vlogger PewDiePie in 2019PewDiePie has been the most popular YouTuber since 20135-Minute Crafts, which offers quick and quirky DIY tips to viewers, didn\u0027t even feature in the top 15 YouTube channels in July 2018Brazilian music video producer and director KondZilla began his career after buying a camera with life insurance money left to him after his mother died when he was 18Sony Entertainment Televesion (SET) launched in 1995 and has recently seen huge growth of its Hindi-language YouTube channelCanadian musician Justin Bieber held the number-two spot in 2018 before T-Series took over World Wrestling Entertainment has managed to gain a huge following on YouTube by sharing clips of fights and interviews with its starsThis YouTube channel specialises in 3D animation videos of nursery rhymes, as well as its own original songs.

While the accusations of treachery and entitlement may have riled viewers on an emotional level, the reaction to her claim that Charles was pressuring men into sexual contact elicited a more complex response.It would be naive to say that the Me Too movement has completely changed society’s view on sexual assault and harassment, but it is fair to suggest that in cases where accusations are made, the morally correct response is broadly understood to be:\u0026nbspbelieve the victim. But we forget that the allegations against Charles did not come from a victim, but from a former friend who – by her own admission – was a bystander in more than one of these apparent instances. Further, the power differential in the allegations against Charles isn’t as straightforward as that of Harvey Weinstein, for example – allegations of a straight, white,\u0026nbspmale\u0026nbspmultimillionaire\u0026nbspHollywood producer coercing young unknown female actors into sexual acts under the understanding that their refusal would end their careers.Jeffree Star and Tati’ video\u0026nbspposted in January, before the feud (James CharlesYouTube)In an episode of Radio 4’s Late Night Woman’s Hour, host Emma Barnett discussed the situation at the time with beauty journalist Sali Hughes and writer and broadcaster Miranda Sawyer. Hughes, who admits she didn’t know who James Charles was until that week, points out that he is “this barely-an-adult, young gay man in make-up – which is a hard thing to be in society”.\u0026nbspOf course, Charles does have a huge following, wealth, and stature in the community, so it’s not unfeasible that he could have wielded the power to pressure men into sex, but the narrative around the discussion at the time seemed to ignore the reality that there is a big difference between a heterosexual man pressuring a woman into sex, and a young gay man doing the same to straight men.AFPGetty)The double-edged sword of overnight fameHerd mentality and cancel culture do not lead to thoughtful analysis of a situation, but rather to a distilled version of a story which people will blindly latch onto to validate their own beliefs, and a pervasive one is that influencers largely do not deserve the acclaim and success they achieve.\u0026nbspThey are seen as narcissistic and entitled. People who manage to make a living just by being young and charismatic. This sense of unfairness around their success is amplified in cases like that of Charles, whose sudden rise to internet fame was not necessarily unique, but the scope of his influence and the lightning speed with which he achieved it is unparalleled.By May 2019 – just over two and a half years after the ringlight photo – Charles had 16.6 million subscribers on YouTube, putting him in an elite category of beauty influencers alongside Rachel Claire Levin (14 million subscribers), who began posting YouTube videos in 2010 Jeffree Star (15 million subscribers), whose audience has been growing since the mid-2000s when he was one of the most popular pages on MySpace NikkieTutorials (12 million subscribers), who’s been posting on YouTube since 2010 and Safiya Nygaard, who rose to prominence when she made videos for BuzzFeed in 2015. Charles’s overnight success stood in huge contrast to the reality of “making it” as an influencer, which typically involves years of hard graft and steady growth.YouTuber outside his dressing room on ‘Ellen’ in 2016: he discussed fame, coming out, make-up and social media with the LGBT+ icon (James CharlesInstagram)Brooks believes his fast rise to fame may have been a key factor in the collective desire to take him down. “A lot of YouTubers – including Tati Westbrook – started at a time when the industry and the community wasn’t so fickle. James’s very quick rise to fame in a way gives way to his downfall.”She explains that while YouTubers who have been on the platform for a decade have a dedicated, loyal audience, the new wave of followers who have latched onto Charles recently have not developed the long-term allegiance to him, and know they have hundreds of others creators out there whose content they can consume instead.Influencer and author Emily Clarkson wrote about the scandal as it was unfolding. On her blog, Pretty Normal Me, she wrote that James Charles was “a victim of his own success”.“For months and years he has been treated like a god, been made allowances for, had his bad behaviour excused because of his celebrity status. In turn, he got swept up in himself and his life and his wealth and his fame. He lost his sense of everything important and he fucked up. And now he’s paying the price. He is a victim of his own success, of an industry that builds people to extraordinary levels. And one that tears them down at a moment’s notice too,” she said at the time.It’s impossible not to see the parallels between Charles – someone who achieved giddy heights of recognition at such a young age – and the schadenfreude with which society has always consumed stories of young celebrities falling from grace.\u0026nbspKardashian in 2016: Kardashian unfollowed Charles during the Westbrook feud, but they have since made up (James CharlesInstagram)In an article examining the fallout from Britney Spears’s notorious breakdown in 2007, author Kate Leaver writes: “It was us, after all, who destroyed her. She didn’t crumble in isolation or simply of her own volition she overdosed on fame and we were complicit in that. We made her the single most watched human being on the planet and then, gleefully, watched as she nearly died from overexposure. We celebrated her ascent to celebrity and then punished her for attaining the very perfection we demand.”We can see this unflattering trait of society in the way we’ve revelled in the demise of countless other young celebrities – Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Bynes and Aaron Carter to name just a few. While Charles’s fame may be slightly more niche than his mainstream counterparts, he was by no means insulated from the cruel delight with which the people who built him up rushed to take him down.Charles made a fatal error in his handling of the situation – one which it seemed might cost him any chance of overcoming the mass exodus of his followers: he uploaded an apology video.Tati Westbrook following the James Charles \u0027Bye Sister\u0027 scandal: \u0027I don\u0027t want you guys hating him\u0027YouTube has seen so many apology videos that the concept has become a meme in and of itself. Earlier this year, images of a child who attended VidCon – the world’s biggest YouTuber convention – dressed as an apology video went viral. These videos are generally portrayed as unscripted and teary, with the influencer in question usually make-up free and wearing the strangely ubiquitous grey hoodie.Writing about the “apology video genre” for Vice, journalist Bettina Makalintal says: “On YouTube, apologies …\u0026nbsphave become just another product. With high-profile stars always selling something, the apology video is a necessary step of damage control. And if the scandal blows up enough, the apology video can be a way of reeling in new viewers, too – plenty of people, I’m sure, hadn’t heard of Tati Westbrook or James Charles until explainers of their situation ended up everywhere.”Indeed, Charles’s eight-minute now-deleted response video, somewhat gauchely titled “Tati”, did little but add fuel to the fire, and gave viewers further fodder to ridicule him. Grey hoodie-clad and make-up-free, he emphasised how distressed he was by the situation, and at one point rather bizarrely even spoke directly to his mother to apologise.It seemed like it couldn’t get any worse for Charles, and people speculated that his career was over.Then, on 18 May, just over a week after this all began, Charles came back with a vengeance in a second video about the scandal.\u0026nbspIn flawless make-up and with a crisp white backdrop and not a tear in sight, Charles calmly and respectfully spent 41 minutes breaking down Westbrook’s allegations and – crucially – he provided “receipts” – evidence to back up his claims. Westbrook’s original “Bye Sister”\u0026nbspvideo offered no such proof, and relied on the credibility of her personal brand to back her up. While this initially worked, now followers had questions. Suddenly, a second wave of criticism started to boil up on social media, this time\u0026nbsptowards Westbrook, who\u0026nbspher followers began to feel was more calculated in her original video than they originally believed.Charles quickly gained back more than a million subscribers, while Westbrook’s began to fall. At the time of writing, just over two months after it all began, Charles’s Social Blade is consistently green (meaning he’s gaining followers rather than losing them), and he stands at over 15.9 million subscribers – almost as many as he had before the fateful\u0026nbspSBH\u0026nbspsponsored post.“James Charles turned himself around very quickly, and I thought it was very interesting to see how he handled it,” says Brooks. “A lot of people probably expected him to stay silent for a very long time – but for him, that would mean admitting guilt which he didn’t think he had – or to really hit back in this really extravagant, dramatic, almost bitchy way that we’re used to seeing James do.”After his video was posted, both Westbrook and Star (who had been publicly lashing out against Charles and threatened to post a tell-all video “exposing” him) gracefully backed down, saying they would no longer be addressing any of the allegations.Jeffree Star speaking about his relationships after Charles named him in his ‘No Mores Lies’ video (Jeffree StarYouTube)Within the subsequent couple of weeks most of the videos and tweets made by Westbrook and Star were quietly deleted, leading many to believe this was a carefully orchestrated – and highly successful – act of damage control involving lawyers.That’s not to say Charles hasn’t lost out. His clothing brand Sisters Apparel, which was distributed by Star’s company Killer Merch, was conspicuously unavailable while this unfoldedJames Charles cancels his Sisters tour after Tati Westbrook rowThis is why the James Charles and Tati Westbrook feud matters so muchJeffree Star wades into feud between James Charles and Tati WestbrookHe also had to cancel a series of live events entitled – you guessed it – Sisters Tour, at least in part due to the impact of the feud. It could also affect his chances of gaining brand sponsorships in the future –\u0026nbspespecially given his history of scandals – and there are still\u0026nbspquestions about the allegations of sexual misconduct made by Westbrook, as he is yet to respond directly. Although, he did “vehemently deny” the allegations made by Gage Gomez that he felt pressurised into sexual activity with the YouTuber when the pair attended Coachella together\u0026nbspearlier this year.But Westbrook hasn’t come out of this well either. Although her subscriber count sits at just under 10 million, her Social Blade is consistently red, meaning she’s losing subscribers on a daily basis. This makes sense – with the outrage at Charles all but gone, many people are back to subscribing based on content, rather than moral judgment, and many of Westbrook’s new followers who wanted to jump on the “cancel James Charles” bandwagon may not actually be fans of her video style. Meanwhile devoted followers may be rethinking their loyalty towards her as the motives behind her original video are called into question.It’s hard to imagine another scandal hitting as hard or rippling as wide as this one.\u0026nbspUsers have perhaps learnt a lesson in the potential consequences of acting on impulse.Brooks believes the debacle has changed the YouTube beauty industry. “Since the drama, we’re realising that we’re feeding into a bigger PR machine more than the audience perhaps realised,” she says.She explains that while\u0026nbsp“authenticity” used to be the currency\u0026nbspfor YouTubers among audiences now in their late 20s who consumed this kind of content a decade ago, younger followers are looking more for the dramatic, soap-opera-esque escapism.Kylie Jenner appeared on Charles’s channel for a Halloween special in 2018 (James CharlesYouTube)“We need to reestablish the balance because there is drama, and while that’s OK for some it’s not necessarily setting the best example or showing the beauty industry in the best light. We need to take a step back and look at the creators who aren’t all about the drama and the big flashiness, what they’re doing is be exceptionally talented – and push those people to the forefront.”While the rise, fall, and rise again of James Charles is unlikely to end a culture of scandal and drama among the beauty YouTuber community, it may well be the catalyst for change in the way audiences react to it.In June, YouTuber Jaclyn Hill (6 million subscribers) released a line of lipsticks which was met with disastrous feedback and allegations that they were expired or contaminated due to reports of plastic and metal shards embedded in the lipstick, holes and grittiness in the products and fluff and hairs in\u0026nbspthe formula.For those eagerly awaiting the next YouTube scandal, this was it. It featured a notoriously controversial influencer, hundreds of thousands of angry consumers, conspiracy theories and endless commentary videos and input from other established YouTubers.\u0026nbspAnd yet while the backlash has been harsh, it has also been measured. Drama channels are treating the scandal with care, urging their viewers to be mindful of Hill’s mental health, and while she is losing subscribers, the numbers are in the hundreds, not the millions.\u0026nbspIt’s hard to imagine her getting off so lightly had this occurred pre-James Charles, and that is surely a sign of a change in the tide of influencer backlash and cancel culture.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000.

A practice run fell 20mph short of the record, but conditions improved on the day and a tailwind helped.Changing the aerodynamics of the car was a balance, as it decreased the 4x4’s top speed, but reduced wind resistance when the bike was released.Mr Campbell laughed: “Porsche spend millions testing their cars in a wind tunnel and we stick a big Tupperware box on the back of it!”He was so desperate to break the record that he ditched a parachute designed to help him brake quickly before the end of the airfield – because it was causing turbulence.\u0026nbspBut he did wear the latest kangaroo-skin protective suit, which inflates in the event of a crash.His next challenge will be to try to reach 220mph next year on a six-mile track at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, USA.He said: “This has been a five-year programme and the record was the culmination of one part of it.“We have been bound by finances and budgeted to do what we can.

Although it was higher than a year ago, the 1.2 per cent annual rise still lagged behind inflation, which is running at 2.1 per cent, according to the latest official data.“There is little doubt that the market continues to face its inevitable challenges,” said Glynis Frew, chief executive of Hunters, an estate agency with over 200 branches across Britain.Official data showed last week that the average price at which homes are sold grew only 0.9 per cent in the year to June, while in London it tumbled by 2.7 per cent. The average British home cost £230,292 in June, down from a peak of £232,000 in August 2018.Buyers have been biding their time as it remains unclear whether the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal. In the latter case, house prices could plunge by almost 6 per cent in 2020 and another 3 per cent in 2021, according to forecasts by the government’s spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility.However, the more confident buyers are now abandoning the ‘wait and see’ approach and taking advantage of improved housing affordability as the Brexit deadline nears, Ms Frew said, commenting on Rightmove’s findings.For its latest report, Rightmove measured 130,435 asking prices, covering around 90 per cent of the UK market. The properties were put on sale by estate agents between 7 July to 10 August and advertised on rightmove.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is still not clear why those strange parts of the sky would behave in such an outstanding way.But researchers have now claimed that those spots of energy could be the consequence of conformal cyclic cosmology, a theory that suggests that our universe existed in another form before ours. They could have formed from black holes, the researchers suggest in a new paper.As such, those unexplained swirling areas in the sky could be the leftovers of another universe.“What we claim we’re seeing is the final remnant after a black hole has evaporated away in the previous aeon, Roger Penrose, a mathematical physicist at Oxford Universe and one of the authors of the study, told New Scientist, which first reported the news.Created with Sketch.Best NASA pictures of the month - July 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A total solar eclipse as seen from the US National Science Federation observatory in the Chilean Andes on 2 JulyA composite image of the Cygnus OB2 star cluster composed of pictures taken by the Isaac Newton Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope on July 24The spacecraft Soyuz MS-13 is launched at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on July 20A copy of LIFE magazine from July 4 1969 signed by Michael Collins is seen onboard the Soyuz spacecraftThe galaxy NGC 1156 which is said to resemble a cherry blossom tree.

That radiation could last from one version of the universe into the next, they claim.Strange flashes are coming from our nearest black hole, scientists sayThose places where the electromagnetic radiation was especially high\u0026nbsp– referred to as Hawking points – could therefore be left over from the previous universe.Those anomalous points would therefore be explained by what is known as CCC theory. Rather than being mysteriously glowing points, they would be the final evaporation of the supermassive black holes that were in the version of the universe that came before ours.Many scientists have objected to the idea of the cyclical universe, and Hawking radiation still remains to be confirmed.But the researchers say that they hope their analysis will at least help to give us a a significant initial indication of the nature of these anomalous regions and provides an important new input into cosmology, irrespective of the validity of CCC.And they conclude by suggesting that their findings will pose a significant problem for the conventional understanding of the universe, however they are formed.\u0026nbspIt is hard to see, however, that they find a natural explanation in the currently conventional inflationary picture, they write.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

who was named the sixth best dressed woman in the world at the time - had at least  lovers including Indian Prime Minister Nehru and singer Leslie Hutch Hutchinson, who she once gted a jewel-encrusted penis sheath.She was said to be sexually obsessed, once being thrusted across a banquet table during a romp with one lover.Lord Mountbatten - who Prince Louis is widely-believed to be named after  - was ‘devastated’ by her infidelity in the early days of their marriage.But realising he had little choice in the matter, he began taking lovers of his own, too.Yesterday, FBI documents from the s revealed shocking claims that Mountbatten - who was murdered by an IRA bomb  years ago this month -  was secretly “a homosexual with a perversion for young boys.”In the documents, the couple are described as “persons of extremely low morals” and many have suggested both were bisexual - a huge taboo at the time.Here, we delve into their controversial marriage.The great-grandson of Queen Victoria, Mountbatten – the uncle of Prince Philip – was born in  at Frogmore House, Windsor as Prince Louis of Battenberg, a title he lost when he and other royals dropped Germanic names during World War I.By the time he met -year-old Edwina Ashley, in , she was a leading light in London society with an inheritance of £millionfrom her grandfather, financier Ernest Cassel, to fund her party lestyle.Their wedding, at St Margaret’s chapel, Westminster, attracted a crowd of , and was attended by many members of the royal family including Queen Mary, Queen Alexandra and the then Prince of Wales – the future Edward VIII.Both were virgins when they wed but Edwina soon revealed her love of sex when she asked to go to Paris on their honeymoon so they could explore “the most awful places we could find”.Louis found sex less appealing, calling it a mixture of psychology and hydraulics.He was so awkward in bed he was said to have named her breasts Mutt and Jeff - naval slang for medals.Louis - affectionately known by his family as Dickie - was often away with the navy and cracks began to show in their marriage after the birth of their first daughter, Patricia, in .Edwina was so jealous of the attention the baby got that she packed her off to a nanny the South Coast and embarked on a series of affairs.She soon surrounded herself with a harem of lovers she referred to as “ginks” – including Lord Molyneux, a rich American polo player called Laddie Sandford and newspaper editor Mike Wardell.Daughter Pamela Hicks later revealed that several admirers were often in tow at the same time, and even had to be kept apart at the family home, Broom House in Park Lane.“When my mother ed from shopping one day she was met with, Mr Larry Gray is in the drawing room, Mr Sandford is in the library, Mr Ted Phillips is in the boudoir, Señor Portago [is] in the anteroom and I don’t know what to do with Mr Molyneux’,” she wrote.Divorce, especially within the Royal family, was frowned upon and Pamela said the fallout was “messy and complex.”“When my father first heard that she had taken a lover, he was devastated,” she said. “But eventually, using their reserves of deep mutual affection, my parents managed to negotiate a way through this crisis and found a modus vivendi .”The pair agreed to a ‘discreet’ open marriage and Pamela said that her father’s “total desire for my mother’s happiness” was what made the marriage work.When her husband was posted to Malta, in the early s, Edwina enjoyed a fling with American golfer Bobby Sweeney.For his part, in , Dickie began to flirt with -year-old Margaret Whigham, the future Duchess Of Argyll – who became notorious for her own sex scandal in , when she was photographed performing a sex act on an unknown man.He finally entered into a long term affair with Yola Letellier, the boyish Frenchwoman who inspired Colettes  novella, Gigi.But the biggest scandal of the couple’s marriage was about to break.Its reported that pair were the “talk of the West End” and the scandal had “shaken society to its very depth”, causing the woman to be “exiled” by royal command.The woman was soon identied as Edwina – who had recently joined her husband in Malta – and the man was wrongly thought to be singer and activist Paul Robeson.After a court case held in secret, the paper finally apologised and offered “genuine and deep regrets”.But many believe Edwina’s real lover was the suave and famously well-endowed West Indian cabaret singer and pianist, Leslie ‘Hutch’ Hutchinson, who was becoming notorious for bedding society women.The bisexual entertainer - who had lost his childhood innocence when his father took him to a brothel at the age of  - had arrived in London in the s after being discovered by Cole Porter.“Edwina interrupted Hutch playing the piano,” he says. “She kissed his neck and led him by the hand behind the closed doors of the dining-room. There was a shriek, and a few minutes later she ed, straightening her clothes.“Hutch seemed elated, and before he ed to the piano, told me that, with one thrust, he had flashed [propelled] her theof the dining-room table.”Lady Mountbatten was said to be so besotted that she showered him with gts, including a jewelled gold cigarette case, a gold ring engraved with her coat of arms, a gold and diamond watch and – outrageously – a Cartier, jewel-encrusted penis sheath.One disputed story surrounding the pair was that they were once locked in a sexual position when Edwina suffered from vaginismus - a condition that makes the vagina clamp around a penis - and the couple had to be separated at hospital.One night, an inebriated Mountbatten fell into Quaglino’s restaurant and told the bandleader, Van Straten:  “I am lonely and sad and drunk...

Even these ones,they were going through the long grass you wouldnt see them.If she doesnt want to be seen, you arent going to see her.Its so nice to discover something new in nature.So much of the time you hear about species being extinct, and here we are with something new. Its incredible.Alan started a research programme at his ,ha reserve around ten years ago, studying how mostly black leopards survive outside of protected areas.The area is perfect for wildle because the mountainous terrain puts off poachers and animal farmers, while the surrounding citrus groves provide perfect safe corridors.Four years ago Alan caught Goldie - then a cub - on camera with her mum Pippa, but kept quiet, fearing she might not survive into adolescence.He said locals started talking about an oddly coloured lioness in the area - not home to any lions - and Alan wonderedit might be the now-adult strawberry leopard.Returning home during a thunder storm in late July, he came across a dead pregnant giraffe, suspected to have died from a heart attack.After checking there was nothing they could do, they cut her open to encourage predators who would usually be too small to feast on giraffes.They set up a motion camera, nailed to a tree, and ed to collest the memory card a month later.Strawberry leopards are caused by a rare gene mutation called erythrism.The little-understood genetic condition causes an overproduction of red pigments or an underproduction of dark pigments.This results in their distinctive orangey-pink tinge.The first strawberry leopard was spotted in the wild and photographed in  in South Africas Madikwe Game Reserve – more than km from the recent sighting.Alan said: We thought we might get too photos of blades of grass.But I was in the bar and this very shocked, pale, researcher who was going through the photos came and said you need to look at this.There she was, this golden leopard feeding from am to am. It was pretty cool.In one, she has turned around and snarled at the camera. You can see her nose wrinkled up. Its quite amazing.And its just so clear."},{"url":null,"title":"lions extinction wild experts medicine bone trade","story":"The demand for traditional medicine is said to be fuelling the sick practice where lions are bred and killed for their bones.Animal welfare experts have called for a ban on the fast-expanding industry, which they say is trading lions into extinction.Head of policy at the Born Free Foundation, Mark Jones, told : Lions are not designed to be raised in captivity.This is all about cash before conservation in what is a really cruel and cynical industry.The latest comments come after a year-long investigation into the callous industry headed by former Tory peer Lord Ashcroft.His probe discovered some of the lions are even being targeted inside fenced enclosures by wealthy trophy hunters.The canned hunting industry is so despicable that even other hunting organisations want to distance themselves from it.Among the shooters are Brits who are paying thousands for the privilege to kill the maginicent beasts, reports the Mail on Sunday.Those that arent shot by the heartless hunters are butchered in slaughterhouses for their  bones - used to treat ailments like rheumatism.Besides the bones, other body parts are in great demand as the animal represents strength and bravery, which are believed to be transferred to the patient.The Global Nature Fund estimates more than , lions are killed annually for the burgeoning bone trade, including many in South Africa.Dr Jones added: The international trade in lion bones is a relatively new thing but has grown enormously over the last decade.Initially, it was a by-product of canned hunting but more recently it is now an end product in itself.People are breeding them for commercial purposes and the South African government is actively encouraging this.There have been horric reports of lions being kept in appalling conditions. They are starved and emaciated.If your aim is to extract a skeleton, then these farms do not have to worry about the conditions of the lions while they are alive.The cubs born in the more ruthless farms are taken away from their mothers at just a few days old to be hand reared.As the lions become too dangerous to be allowed near tourists some are supplied to South Africa’s burgeoning ‘trophy hunting’ industry."},{"url":null,"title":"this futuristic round house on sale for 950k is hiding an amazing 1930s art deco interior","story":"The waterfront home in Essexs Frinton-On-Sea may look modern from the outside but it has an incredible s art deco interior -

This was passed by a majority of close to  MPs."},{"url":null,"title":"posturing revolutionary corbyn unfit to lead","story":"The Labour leader demanded that their “priority” should be to put him into No as a “strictly time- limited temporary” Prime Minister, to postpone Brexit and call an election.But Mr Corbyn’s “plan” unravelled as soon as it was unveiled, with new Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson ruling out — as she has many times before — any possibility of working with him.Whatever one thinks of the Lib Dems’ stance on Brexit, the party is genuinely mainstream, with mainstream MPs and a mainstream leader.So it should surprise no one that the Lib Dems are not willing to countenance putting a man many consider to be a racist, socialist revolutionary into power, even for a day and even to stop Brexit.But their rejection will not have surprised Mr Corbyn or his allies in any way because they knew full well that his letter would crash and burn the moment it was made public.Indeed, that is precisely why they sent it. Not for a moment did they envisage having to act on it.The letter was — like almost everything Mr Corbyn has ever said or done — about posturing rather than acting. The Labour leader spent  years as a backbencher before his elevation to being Leader of the Opposition.During those three decades he achieved precisely nothing.Had he not been elected leader, the few people to have been aware of his existence would have known him as a minor fringe MP who hung out with terrorists and racists.The sum total of his contribution to politics as a backbencher was to have proposed  Early Day Motions, the parliamentary equivalent of tweeting.Topics which he considered worth his time included “seal genitalia”, “Disney children’s pyjamas” and an MI proposal to use pigeons as flying bombs.Mr Corbyn’s natural disposition is to tear down, to criticise and to oppose.He could not even bring himself to support his own party when it was in power, voting against the last Labour government  times.There is not a single piece of legislation that owes anything to his contribution.This is the context in which his and Labour’s seemingly incoherent stance on Brexit — one day against another referendum, another day for one one day for Brexit, another day for Remain — must be seen.He is uninterested in the mechanics of a concrete solution. He has no real views on the details of Brexit or even how we get there.For Mr Corbyn, Brexit is a means to an end — which is as a vehicle to power.That is why, for example, he has on  occasions instructed Labour MPs either to abstain or to vote with the Government on Brexit, rather than attempting in any serious way to force the Government to change course, either over the type or Brexit on offer or a second referendum.He wants Brexit.He and his coterie of revolutionary socialists believe that leaving without a deal will be chaotic and that in that chaos Labour will be swept into office.But that, by definition, requires Brexit both to happen and to be chaotic.Most of his party take a dferent view — most are Remainers — so every so often the Corbynites view it as tactically wise to offer the appearance of wanting to work against the Government’s version of Brexit.Hence yesterday’s letter. But it is all meaningless posing. In her speech yesterday rejecting Mr Corbyn’s demand that she support him as PM, Jo Swinson hit the nail on the head.She said: “In my first week as leader of the Liberal Democrats I called on Jeremy Corbyn to table a vote of no confidence in the Government and I asked him to table it before summer recess, because that was the only way to be sure we could hold an election before crashing out on the st of October.”You do not have to share Ms Swinson’s opposition to Brexit to accept that her analysis is spot on.Mr Corbyn refused to table such a vote of no confidence at the end of July. Had he actually wanted to avoid No Deal, he would have done.There was every chance Boris Johnson’s new government would have lost and we would now be in the middle of an election campaign.Whatever the outcome of that election, we would not — as we are now — be spending time analysing the prospects of a so-called government of national unity or looking at cynical letters written by the Labour leader.Mr Corbyn and his allies doubtless think they are being extremely clever, riding two horses at the same time.But his problem is that every time he opens his mouth, the unsuitability for office becomes ever clearer. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thats why we want a deal.But it is also the case that the UK government is far more prepared now than it was in the past.But a former head of the British civil service, Lord Bob Kerslake, who described the document as credible, said the dossier lays bare the scale of the risks we are facing with no-deal Brexit in almost every area.He added: These risks are completely insane for this country to be taking and we have to explore every avenue to avoid them.Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said, in a tweet, that Ireland had always been clear a hard border in Ireland must be avoided.The leak comes as Boris Johnson prepares to travel to Berlin to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday, before going to Paris to meet French President Emmanuel Macron the following day.Mr Johnson has repeatedly vowed to leave the bloc on Halloween with or without a deal - and pointed the finger at the anti-democratic EU for pushing the UK towards a No Deal by refusing to negotiate.After more than three years of Brexit dominating EU affairs, the bloc has repeatedly refused to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement which includes an Irish border insurance policy that Johnsons predecessor, Theresa May, agreed in November.Mr Johnson will tell Mrs Merkel and Mr Macron there must be a new Brexit deal when he makes his first trip abroad as PM.Details of the PMs travel plans emerged as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn reiterated his call for MPs to work together to prevent a no-deal Brexit.Mr Corbyn, who set out his plan to be installed as a caretaker prime minister last week to stop the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal, said his proposal is the most democratic way to prevent a no-deal."},{"url":null,"title":"brits would rather have a no deal brexit than let jeremy corbyn wreak havoc in no10 poll reveals","story":"Nearly half of voters want to leave the bloc without a withdrawal agreementit means the Labour boss stays away from Downing Street.Forty eight per cent of voters want Corbyn away from No but around a third,  per cent, preferred the option of Corbyn as PM and a second referendum being staged.Meanwhile  per cent of voters were unsure either way, a YouGov poll found.The vote also found that almost a quarter of Remain voters would prefer No Dealit meant no Corbyn in No, while  per cent of Labour voters say the same about their own leader.While  per cent of Leave voters would rather a No Deal Brexitit meant no Corbyn -

But Mr McDonnell ruled out Mr Corbyn standing aside so another MP can become Prime Minister.  “We donapost believe thataposs a negotiable issue,” said Mr McDonnell. “We want to abide by the normal constitutional practice … Jeremy is going to bring the leader of the opposition parties together next week and talk about how we go forward.” Mr McDonnell also did not guarantee Labour will bring forward a no-confidence motion in the government as soon as Parliament s. He told the BBC: The no confidence motion is one mechanism.But, as Jeremy has said today, thereaposs other mechanisms people are looking at, other parliamentary mechanisms, and we want to have a proper discussion and dialogue on a cross-party basis on what those mechanisms are. The chances of No Deal Brexit have been ramping up after Boris Johnson said he would leave do or die on October .  The Prime Minister will visit Berlin and Paris this week to meet leaders Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron followed by the G summit in Biarritz. But the chances of a breakthrough look bleak with the EU still refusing to reopen the -page Brexit withdrawal agreement. The Operation Yellowhammer document was leaked to the Sunday Times - prompting a furious response from Downing Street. A Number  source said: This document is from when ministers were blocking what needed to be done to get ready to leave and the funds were not available.  It has been deliberately leaked by a former minister in an attempt to influence discussions with EU leaders. Those obstructing preparation are no longer in Government, £ billion of extra funding already made available and Whitehall has been stood up to actually do the work through the daily ministerial meetings. The entire posture of Government has changed. The Mirror understands the document was presented at a Brexit aposwar cabinetapos meeting around a week after Boris Johnson took power. Yet a Downing Street spokeswoman said the leaked dossier was out of date and we are making all necessary preparations ahead of October . The spokeswoman said: In relation to business we have been engaging widely and will continue to do so and thataposs been signicantly stepped up in recent weeks. We have published numerous documents on how businesses can prepare. You can expect to see further information being published in the coming weeks in relation to how the public... can further prepare and the changes that they are likely to see across a range of areas. A large-scale public information campaign is expected to begin shortly, Downing Street added. Askedthere was a mole hunt, she said: I’m not aware of any inquiry per se. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said MPs mustto hold increasingly reckless Boris Johnson to account.  She told the BBC: I think there is ever more evidence of the, frankly, impending national emergency that we are facing. MPs should be in Parliament holding an increasingly reckless Prime Minister to account. Since his election as Prime Minister, Boris Johnson has been subject to, I think, about three hours of scrutiny. And yet he is putting his foot on the accelerator, driving the country off the clf-edge ashe had a huge mandate and overwhelming support. He has no mandate for this. The Government has a majority of precisely one. She added: I think at a time of such emergency, the public are rightly saying aposWhere are MPs  Where are they when it comes to holding this Prime Minister to account apos.

However the Royals wonapost be able to take part in one of their favourite summer activities this year, and theyaposre sure to be very disappointed.The Queen has been forced to call off the whole grouse shooting season as there has been a drop in the number of the birds in the area due to insects and bad  weather  , reports the  Express  .   Prince Charles, William, Harry and Kate have all been known to go out shooting over the summer months, and last year they even took little George along to watch. The news will be a blow to the family, who are all said to really enjoy shooting. An insider told the Express: There’s not much  to do at Balmoral and that’s why so many guests come.

A few hours later, Helen was lying on her bed with what she thought was a tight chest.    I have never been ill in my le so I knew something was really wrong, she said. I was struggling to breathe and all of a sudden I was having pains in my arm. I phoned the doctors and the receptionist said that you need to go to hospital right now. I really started to panic then.

He was pictured after the billionaire had left the property – which victims described as being full of pornographic and bizarre ornaments – with another female who looked to be in her teens, shivering in a thin jumper while he wore a thick coat. The footage was shot in December , a day after the infamous image of Andrew with Epstein in the city’s Central Park, following his jail release. The park photo embarrassed Buckingham Palace as the Duke of York faced calls to explain why he had not broken links with his disgraced pal. And Buckingham Palace has been quick to deny claims two of Epstein’s alleged victims have made against him since.    But the new footage of Andrew at Epstein’s lair has piled pressure on him to finally come clean about their friendship. One question being asked is how the bizarre features in Epstein’s New York home did not seem to ring alarm bells. Visitors to the £million, nine-storey Manhattan property, which included a steady stream of young women, said it was as weird as Epstein himself – who talked of having his penis ­cryogenically frozen and seeding humanity with his DNA. The entry foyer where Andrew stood to wave off the brunette was decorated with rows of framed articial eyeballs. Close by hung an oil painting of ex-President Bill Clinton in red heels and the semen-stained blue dress that Monica Lewinsky wore when she performed a sex act on him. A chandelier had a le-size female doll hanging from it and his bathroom had prosthetic breasts on the wall so he could play with the nipples while he bathed. A creepy chessboard featured customised figurines modelled on his female staff, apparently dressed suggestively. Behind Epstein’s desk was a  painting by Kees van Dongen called Femme Fatale, showing a woman cupping her exposed left breast.     And another large painting showed Epstein himself in a prison surrounded by barbed wire and gun-toting guards – which he said was “to remind me I could go back to prison any time”. But Andrew apparently brushed off all these indications about Epstein, as he did when others asked him. In a  Vanity Fair article about his relationship with the pervert, a friend of the pair was quoted as saying: “I remember when Andrew and Jeffrey became friends. “Jeffrey had Andrew put on a pair of sweatpants for the first time. He had him wear blue jeans. It was Jeffrey who taught Andrew how to relax. After Jeffrey was convicted, I phoned Andrew and told him, ‘You cannot have a relationship with Jeffrey.’ And he said, ‘Stop giving me a hard time, you’re such a puritan.’  “Our conversation descended into a screaming match and Andrew said, ‘Leave me alone, Jeffrey’s my friend, being loyal to your friends is a virtue’.” Depraved Epstein died in custody nine days ago, aged , while being held on child sex-trafficking charges. His death has been ruled a suicide but this is still being disputed. He had faced trial next June,  years after he was jailed in Florida. In a sweetheart deal in  he admitted procuring an underage girl, aged , for prostitution. He got just  months. An alleged victim, aged , and her parents claimed Epstein molested her at his mansion in Palm Beach, where bathrooms were stocked with soaps shaped like male and female genitalia. Since the  Central Park photo emerged, two of Epstein’s alleged victims have accused Andrew of impropriety. “Sex slave” Virginia Giuffre, then Roberts, claimed she was “lent out” to the Duke for sex on three occasions – one of them in London. And Johanna Sjoberg had alleged that he groped her breast at Epstein’s New York home when she was . Ms Giuffre and Ms Sjoberg made their allegations against Andrew as part of a  Florida court filing. But a judge threw out the claims and ordered them struck from the record as “immaterial and impertinent”. Days before Epstein was found dead, a huge legal dossier containing the lurid allegations was unsealed.  Andrew’s lawyers reiterated their denials, saying: “It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is  and without foundation.” Buckingham Palace also said in  that “any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue”. But despite the repeated denials of wrongdoing, Andrew and the palace have yet to explain the photo of him with his arm around Ms Giuffre, then , in London in  – and why he did not sever his ties with Epstein once he was a ­registered sex offender. Andrew, , was introduced to Epstein in the s by British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of the late, disgraced ­newspaper owner Robert. The -year-old was allegedly his fixer for young girls but she denies all claims and has never been arrested. Records detailing flights by Epstein’s private jet reveal that in May , Andrew flew to Palm Beach with him and Maxwell. A month later, Epstein and Maxwell are believed to have attended a bumper royal birthday bash at Windsor, marking Andrew’s th, Princess Anne’s th, Princess Margaret’s th and Prince William’s th. That autumn, Andrew was a guest at a Halloween “hookers and bondage” party in Manhattan, where Maxwell dressed as a prostitute. And in December that year, the Prince hosted a birthday party for Maxwell at Sandringham, which Epstein attended. All three then went to Thailand to celebrate the New Year. Other encounters between Andrew and Epstein are believed to have taken place at the Queen’s Norfolk estate and a dinner in Saint Tropez.

the sides prepare for cup tie","story":"Dundee host Aberdeen in the Betfred Cup on Sunday and, eventhe Dons have had a few early season problems, it’s fair to say anything other than a win for them would be a shock.On the back of relegation, James McPake’s Dark Blues are finding their feet after a major overhaul of the squad during the summer.It means they go into this tie as major underdogs, though history does tell us this is a competition in which Dundee are capable of upsetting the odds.Tonight Tele Sport looks back at a couple of occasions when they have – and some others when the result has been true to the form book.While unlike the present format, this tie was over two legs, it was similar to this clash in that Dundee had just been relegated at the end of the previous season.Aberdeen were at the peak of their powers under Alex Ferguson and, as reigning champions, a bigger knockout tie for them was a European Cup meeting with Liverpool around the same time.That they went out of that competition to the team that would eventually win it was no great surprise but losing to Dundee was.After a draw at Dens in the first leg, the feeling was Donald Mackay’s team were heading to the Granite City hoping for little more than to keep the score respectable.In the end, however, a battling performance saw them hold their own and progress to the semi-finals thanks to a Cammy Fraser strike.Dundee would go on to make the final before losing to city rivals United on a historic day at Dens Park.The only time the north-east rivals have faced up in a national final and it was Aberdeen who lted the trophy with a comfortable Hampden victory.Once again, the pair met with Dundee, under Jim Duffy, out of the top flight but going into the tie on the back of a fine unbeaten run that saw them riding high in the First Division and making the final.For those of a Dark Blue persuasion, however, it quickly became a day to forget as their team didn’t really show up.An effort from former Dens favourite Billy Dodds had Aberdeen ahead by the break and, when Duncan Shearer added a second right at the start of the second half, it was all over bar the shouting.Although Dundee were again in the second tier, with the backing of Aberdeen-based businessman Callum Melville, their strong line-up was always going to provide a stern test for the visiting Dons.So it proved as, despite losing experienced goalkeeper Rab Douglas through injury in the first half, Jocky Scott’s team pulled off the result of the round by winning in extra-time.Goals from Eddie Malone and Craig Forsyth had the home team apparently cruising but a double from Michael Paton saw the proceedings heading into extra-time.As the game ebbed and flowed, one of those Melville-backed signings, a young Leigh Grfiths, came up trumps with the winner.The last time the teams met in a League Cup tie saw Dundee still recovering from a second period of administration that had seen the team almost fold the previous year.Having performed a miracle in keeping the team in the First Division in the   season, boss Barry Smith was looking to pull off a shock at Pittodrie.They battled hard to give him the scalp he wanted but, on the night, came up just short.A tight tie was decided as early as the th minute when home attacker Darren Mackie grabbed the only goal."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.38795336-240x180.jpg

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"going deep to build community self belief","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Go Deep initiative set up camp in Lochgilphead last week.Go Deep is described as a game based on the metaphor of atransport system.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace.

at Barrel Law, near Hawick.In September, plans for an poundm wind farm were rejected by Scottish Borders councillors.The proposal would have seen seven turbines, of up to m in height, erected on land to the north-west of Roberton, near Hawick.The company behind the plans, Germany-based ABO Wind, then submitted an appeal to the Scottish Governmentrsquos planning and environmental appeals ision .As part of that appeal process, the DPEArsquos appointed reporter Elspeth Cook held a hearing at Forman Hall, Roberton.However, the hearing was simply to clary and define legal terms and certain technical standards in order to help inform Ms Cookrsquos decision.For example, one point of contention between Scottish Borders Council and ABO Wind is whether or not the combined appearance of Barrel Law and the existing wind turbines at Langhope Rig will create a lsquolandscape with wind turbinesrsquo or a lsquowind turbine landscapersquo, as per the legally-defined definitions.The councilrsquos position is that a distance of between -km is required in order to maintain the current landscape type in the valley, but ABO Wind suggest the turbines should be less than km apart, as they state that spreading out the two turbine sites would actually make the landscape look more saturated as the wind turbines would effectively cover a larger area.Furthermore, they state that a greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms on the landscape, and recognising that they are two dferent wind farms not one development.ldquoThe proximity of them makes this appear more of a wind farm landscape rather a landscape with wind farms.ldquoWhile I accept that separating the developments would make the wind farms seem more spaced out, by putting them closer yoursquod increase density.John Campbel QC, appearing on behalf of a group of objectors called Barrel Law Action Group, said: ldquoIf you pull the wind farms apart then clearly you increase the area of cumulative effect.ldquoIf you pull them together, yoursquore going to increase the cumulative effect just by sheer numbers, and you lose the ability to discern the two as distinct entities.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, appearing in his capacity as Scottish Borders Councilrsquos executive member for planning and environment, told the hearing: ldquoIt seems to me that the guidance allows for developments in this area but doesnrsquot necessarily promote it.ldquoNo one is disputing that the two wind farms would be separate, wersquore working to find out what degree of separation would be appropriate.Mr Welsh responded: ldquoIf you increase to a km distance it will push all m turbines outwith the area that has been identied as having the appropriate topography for this type of development.Ms Cook also sought clarication on certain technical points, mostly surrounding tables and figures contained within ious reports submitted by the appellant and the local authority."},{"url":null,"title":"art-thou-shakespeare-cyclists","story":"BORDERS

They have got the choice of three roads. The first is the C, which is impossible. Somebody would get killed every day.ldquoThe second is the Lowood Bridge and that is unsuitable.ldquoIf anybody is on that bridge, how will a -tonne lorry be able to pass  If it tried to squeeze through, it would hit the people and would crush them.ldquoThe other option is bringing the traffic through the town and the community of Galashiels does not want that.ldquoThe roads were not built for that use.

This was principally because at the time of the planning application, the contract for removing and treating wasted had not yet been awarded, meaning that the end destination was not known.ldquoThe council has recently awarded the contract for waste recycling to Levenseat, a company based near Forth in North Lanarkshire. Levenseat will consider dferent routes at dferent times of the day, depending on circumstances such as traffic.... We anticipate Levenseat will determine the best routes over the coming weeks.An SBC spokesperson added: ldquoThe number of trips to the waste transfer station is largely in line with trips to the previous landfill site, and signicantly less than could have been generated by an integrated waste management facility at Easter Langlee.ldquoAs part of the planning application which was approved in November , the council committed to improving the road network through additional street-lighting, better signage, localised road widening and removal of trees and vegetation, all of which have taken place.ldquoThe council was not able to define a route during the planning process as the procurement exercise had not been completed and therefore SBC did not know the end destination or the preferred route.ldquoThe new residual waste contract will see the majority of the waste treated to produce a refuse derived fuel ndash to generate heat and electricity ndash as well as recover materials which can be recycled.ldquoThe closure of the landfill site and opening of waste transfer station will also see a reduction in harmful greenhouse gases from landfilling the waste and we believe it will also result in an improved recycling performance."},{"url":null,"title":"innerleithen-set-17th-annual-music-festival","story":"INNERLEITHEN is ready to rock this weekend as it welcomes musicians, dancers and performers to the towns th annual music festival.The StRonans Hotel and Live  Local at the Vale Club have put together a jam-packed programme of bands overthree days.And the Church of Scotland, Tweedside Hotel, Masons Club and the Union Club are all set to host a number of events.The music kicks off on Friday at pm in the St Ronanrsquos Hotel with the Redwood Rejects, at pm with Fin Price at lsquoLive  Localrsquo and at pm with Sparky  The Choirboys at the Tweedside Hotel.On Saturday, alongside the full programmes of bands around Innerleithen, the town is packed with events, starting with the St Ronanrsquos Silver Band coffee morning.Afterwards, the band will be continuing their eight-hour sponsored play out and about in the town.At the Church of Scotland therersquos concerts galore with The Taylor Family  Friends, Borders piper Matt Seattle accompanied by guitarist Donald Knox, and superb Innerleithen-born singer-songwriter Tommy Ashby.Over at the Masons, the regions favourite cover band The Derivatives are appearing, while Rory Speirs is at the Tweedside.There will be something for all the family to enjoy, with a wide selection of workshops, including beginnerrsquos ballet and line dance with the Fiona Henderson School of Dance, as well as singing, belly-dancing and an introduction to ukelele.There will also be an opportunity to learn more about the town on a historical walk with local experts from the Innerleithen Community Trust.Sunday sees the music continue over at the Church of Scotland, with a concert by leading Scots folk singer Christine Kydd, supported by the Borders Gaelic singing group lsquoTurasrsquo and Folksters.And to round off the weekend, therersquos informal music sessions at the Gordon Arms and the Corner House hotels.One of the festivals organisers, Robin Dempsey said: ldquoWe are really excited that we have possibly our biggest ever line up, with around  performances and events on the programme, spread over eight venues.ldquoThe music festival is truly encouraging local talent in the community and it is great to see so many locals and visitors coming together to share their love of music.ldquoWhat has really helped this year is support from our new sponsor, private development group, Whiteburn, who are currently regenerating the former Caerlee Mill site in the town.

AUOB, and SNP MPs and MSPs, lie about the numbers which attend their marches, sometimes up to  or  times.#Unfortunately, they are not challenged by the Scottish media. The good news is that A Force For Good has a presence at every AUOB march. We bear witness to the huge value of the United Kingdom.  Our #Thin Red Line# stands for everyone who likes being British, who likes the UK, and who wants us to stay together.#A group from Barrowfield at the Campbeltown cross ahead of the march.

and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots blocked at their own end, thanks to some vital interventions from Robertson, the Pupils stole a winner when midfield substitute Finn Scott was teed up by Scott Souden to slot the ball home low beyond the Rhu keeper, ensuring the visitors completed pre-season unbeaten.Pupils manager Campbell Robertson said: ‘The conditions were tough, but the boys played really well, and our shape was good too.

It is an intimate world, personal and subjective, the world of our thoughts and feelings. Children live in it quite naturally, but as adults we tend to withdraw from it.#I use high-key expressionist colour to express how I feel about the landscape.#I’ve been painting the area around me now for over  years, and the more I paint Knapdale, the more intensely I use light and colour to express my emotions for the landscape.#John worked for  years as an art teacher at Lochgilphead High School, then in art education with Strathclyde Region before leaving work to paint full-time in .His distinctive colourful landscapes quickly made him one of the Scotland’s most successful painters, with celebrities such as Sting, Madonna, Simon Le Bon and Gregor Fisher collecting his work.Wilma Meikle, who owns the Archway Gallery with her husband Iain, said: #We’re delighted that John has supported the gallery for all these years.

This is standard, legal practice. Safety is our number one priority when arranging home to school transport.The spokesperson added: ldquoWe are working with colleagues across the council and in schools to ensure that all pupils who have been issued with a bus pass are on the transport providersrsquo lists and to improve access to the school transport timetables.ldquoWe recognise that this may have caused uncertainty for parents, carers and pupils.ldquoOur staff and the transport providers will continue to work closely together to manage the transition to these new arrangements.Councillor Craig Hoy, ward member, said: ldquoI was relieved to get clear reassurance from council staff on the issues of vehicle safety and the safety of children travelling from Gford and outlying areas to Knox Academy.ldquoItrsquos clear that there were communications problems which impacted parents and pupils.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays. I hated the back to school adverts on TV as they heralded the end of free days playing on the rocks at the Pans shore, and of loosely defined bedtimes.So I was glad that our youngest daughter Skye was looking forward to school as she enters P. She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really

years. While the name of these types of promotions seems to imply that players will be on the receiving end of totally free spins, during which anything won can be kept and withdrawn, the truth is often a bit murkier than that.The UK Gambling Commission has played no small role in attempting to clear up the matter. According to them, to use the term ldquofree spins casinos must genuinely offer free games with no strings attached, such as wagering requirements. The old, standard spins are to be referred to as ldquobonus spins instead.When Free Spins Are Not Truly Free SpinsThere are several occasions when free spinsarenrsquot free. Any spins which come with wagering requirements, for instance, breach the concept of being truly free. Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached. They should be offered to players with a genuine chance to win real money for free, money which can ndasha player desires ndash be withdrawn from the start. This doesnrsquot mean to say that there arenrsquot other terms and conditions.Many top free spin bonuses tend to come with dates attached, only being valid during a predetermined period. Moreover, they may only be valid on select slot machines and could be limited to players in a specic region.Only a Handful of Chances to WinThere is a downside to the new ldquofree spins offers at casinos. They generally tend to provide a limited number of spins, far fewer than the old no deposit bonuses with wagering requirements, and deposit offers. Moreover, they are often only valid on slot games which do not offer substantial cash prizes, including many simple - line games from NetEnt and others.Promos Which Are Ideal for Test Driving CasinosSuch free spin bonuses which come with no wagering requirements at all are hardly going to be appealing for players who fancy landing big wins. As mentioned, they tend to be valid on slots which donrsquot offer such epic wins. However, these promos and deals may make the ideal introduction to slot gaming for new players, or those who wish to test-drive a slot before deciding to wager real money on it.The East Lothian Courierencourages readers to gamble responsibly.

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

Last October, the SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry mooted a ldquodemocratic event would suffice iethe SNP simply won the most Scottish seats at a general election, independence would follow.Having had their bid rejected, Mr MacNeil and Mr McEleny are now trying a dferent route tabling an amendment to an accepted conference motion on devolution.It says a ldquopro-independence electoral victory shall be a mandate from the people of Scotland to commence independence negotiations with the UK Government,Westminster refused to grant the Scottish Government the power to hold a second referendum.:SNPs Jeane Freeman must inject urgency into -month superhospital probe to protect patientsYet the First Minister wants any decision by Scotland to break free from the UK to be fair, legal and decisive, which was the basis of the  vote as per the Edinburgh Agreement.She insists on the back of the Holyrood vote in , she has a mandate to hold a second referendum and has earmarked the latter part of next year to hold it.But there is one big problem: London says no.If the polls are right ndash two recent ones put the Tories  points clear of Labour ndash then should Boris Johnson make good his promise to lead Britain out of the EU in daysrsquo time, the chances of a snap general election are high. The Prime Minister will be banking on the backers of Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party swinging behind the Tories and giving him a working majority. The Tory manesto would doubtless again include a line about refusing Ms Sturgeonrsquos desire to hold a second independence referendum.Mr Johnson, just like Theresa May before him, will not agree to one because he does not believe the SNP Government has a mandate it does not have a Holyrood majority and, until it does, all bets are off.The Tory Government can do this because Westminster remains the constitutional authority.The PM, given the turmoil of Brexit, needs a new battle on another front like a hole in the head, so will keep saying no. Indeed,the Tories were to win a snap election in November, the next general election would not be due until late .So, is there anything Ms Sturgeon can do to get round this constitutional impasse  Possibly.:Jeremy Corbynrsquos plan to be caretaker prime minister receives further blowUnionist MPs have spotted a potential albeit circuitous route, which is causing some of them a deal of concern.To get to her desired destination, the FM needs that parliamentary majority in Edinburgh to knock aside Whitehallrsquos argument that the SNP administration does not have a mandate.But the next Holyrood election is not until . So, a second referendum next year is impossible, right  Wrong.Section  of the  Scotland Act has two ways to facilitate what is known as an ldquoextraordinary general election in Scotland. The first looks impossible having a two-thirds majority of MSPs to call a new poll. This would mean getting most Labour MSPs to back the idea which will not happen.The alternative route, however, would involve Ms Sturgeon resigning her role.There would be a month to find a new FM. But with the pro-independence Greens, the SNP has an overall majority at Holyrood and so could block anyone filling the role. An extraordinary general election would, therefore, follow. And,Ms Sturgeonrsquos gamble paid off, the SNP would get its majority in the Scottish Parliament.One could argue this is an extremely risky action because there are no guarantees the FM would secure a parliamentary majority.ButBritain faces either a bad or a no-deal Brexit outcome with all the negative consequences people fear would follow, she might, in extremis, have to consider all possibilities, including the ldquonuclear option of collapsing her own government.If she got her new mandate, Ms Sturgeon could turn around to Mr Johnson and say: ldquoGive me my referendum.Last week, even staunch Unionist David Mundell, the former Scottish Secretary, conceded that it would be \"hard to push back\" against a second polla Holyrood election was ldquofought explicitly on the issue of another referendum and then there is a majority of nationalist parties for it.The interesting reference was ldquonationalist parties. At the last Holyrood election the SNP and Greens stood on dferent s butthey were to come together to put indyref front and centre ndash as they presumably would in an extraordinary general election to force another poll ndash then the chances of getting that nationalist majority would be so much higher.In terms of time under this unorthodox route,the FM resigned at the start of , her desired second chance poll could indeed take place in the autumn of next year.One Conservative MP noted that by collapsing her government, the SNP leader would ldquooptimise her chances of having a second poll. ldquoIf she gets a majority, I couldnrsquot see how the PM could refuse another independence referendum.A Liberal Democrat MP also raised concerns at the prospect, stressing: ldquoThis is why itrsquos so important to stop Brexit, so we donrsquot allow it to break up the UK.An SNP MP said the option of Ms Sturgeon resigning to force a snap Holyrood election was an ldquointeresting route to get to indyref.ldquoShe might do it, he declared, noting: ldquoThe more unreasonable the UK Government is, the better. And they are being fantastically unreasonable at the moment. Something has to give.However, a senior Nationalist close to the SNP leader said while she was well aware of the Scotland Act option, it was ldquonot in our thinking. At the moment.A UK Government source was dismissive. ldquoIf Nicola Sturgeon launched a cynical attempt to engineer another referendum, it would go down extremely badly with the majority of Scots, who do not want one in the foreseeable future.Of course, evenMs Sturgeon were to win a majority in a  extraordinary general election in Scotland, Mr Johnson could dig in his heels, raise his nose and simply say no.And, indeed,he were to win a snap UK general election on a manesto of rejecting indyref until November  at the earliest, he could simply respond to the SNP leaderrsquos demand by saying: ldquoTough.

Michael Gove, the Minister in charge of no deal planning, insisted it was a worst case outlook, contrary to what a Whitehall source told the media. The tone was that of an insurance company trying to punt a policy.

It was a Civil Service look at likely scenarios, a heads up from cool, impartial heads. Only those who no longer believe in the Civil Servicersquos impartiality on Brexit would downplay the warnings.Instead of dismissing the coverage as outdated scaremongering, the government should have issued an update on current planning. Why are the plans being cloaked in such secrecythey are purely practical steps that any reasonable administration would take  Contrary to some of the language of recent weeks, we are not at war.Instead, Downing Street chose to focus on the bossrsquos meetings with European leaders. Even these talks, the first face to face encounters since he became PM, will not linger long on Brexit. The new position, the Chancellor and the President will be told, is that a new deal is the only alternative to no deal, and there is nothing the British parliament can do to stop the latter. This is politics as declaration, not negotiation.Since neither Mr Macron nor Mrs Merkel have any intention to reopen talks on the Withdrawal Agreement, they too will be keen to join Mr Johnson in looking ahead to G business. So the most important matter facing the UK will be all but ignored when the British PM meets the two people in the EU who have the clout to change things.: MPs in cross party demand for recallFrosty meetings will play well with the Brexiteers back home. Unlike his previous trips as Foreign Secretary, which largely consisted of him travelling to places and being confronted with asinine words he had said about his now host, the Boris Johnson on parade in Berlin and Paris will be the sombre statesman, the more in sorrow than in anger PM, giving Europe one last chance to do the \"right\" thing.The pictures he is most interested in are not those with Mrs Merkel and Mr Macron, but the ones with Mr Trump and the premiers of Canada and Japan at the G. In Biarritz he will be posing as Boris Johnson, the leader of a outward-looking powerhouse keen to get going on global trade deals. Maybe in their exchange of gts and warm words, Mr Trump will give him a baseball cap with Make Britain Great Again.

A child in what seems to be a bowler hat tucked over his ears clutches a jug in his arms almost as big as he is, and a curious face juts through a tenement window, perhaps anxious to see what the man with the camera might be doing in a grim Glasgow close.These evocative images are among hundreds of Glasgow scenes captured by th-century photographer Thomas Annan, as he meticulously recorded a city undergoing social and structural changes intended to help end the squalor and deprivation, and usher in a new way of le.Many of Annanrsquos photographs shed light on the east endrsquos harsh past, where slum le came to an early end at an average age of just  and the stinking closes and wynds harboured homes crammed with dozens of people sharing the most basic of living conditions.Other images cast light on the effort to raise the cityrsquos living standards ndash such as the pivotal waterworks project that fed clean water from Loch Katrine to the heart of the city.The photographs and Annanrsquos remarkable work is now set to be explored at a sold-out event organised by the Alexander Thomson Society, which is to be held at the Kelvin Hall later this month.According to art historian Anne Lyden, of the National Galleries of Scotland, who will present the event, Annanrsquos fascinating images reflect a time long gone but also serve as a reminder that modern le is not immune from challenges and a constant need for the city to evolve.ldquoAnnanrsquos photographs are interesting because they are a moment when change was already starting to happen in the city, she says. ldquoHe started work in , two years after the Glasgow City Improvements Act and the earlier Police Act were bringing about change and trying to improve conditions.ldquoThere was improved lighting and sanitation. However, the city fathers decided it would be better to completely demolish and start over again.As a result, many of Annanrsquos images show closes and tenements that would go on to be razed, with families displaced and new buildings erected in their place.Some, however, such as an image of the Saltmarket taken in  from Bridgegate, feel almost familiar, save for the eerie figures that line the cobbled street, many with their unsmiling faces turned to the photographerrsquos lens.Many of Annanrsquos photographs, a signicant number of which capture the overcrowded heart of the city, were commissioned by the Glasgow City Improvement Trust with the distinct aim of recording ldquoOld Glasgow before it was demolished.ldquoThe photographs demonstrate the challenges of a shting city and how urban planners have to constantly evaluate what is available for a changing demographic, adds Ms Lyden. ldquoWhen Thomas Annan was documenting these parts of Glasgow, there was a huge movement of people from the north of Scotland and Ireland coming to the city. At one point there were , Irish people living in that area.ldquoSimilar issues are being dealt with today in terms of managing housing stock.Annan took scores of photographs of old closes, tenements and wynds at a time when the compact city centre was home to more than , people. But his work also shed fascinating light on the cityrsquos industrial heritage, including images of work to dredge areas of the Clyde and of grand houses also facing demolition for new housing schemes and roads ndash just as the grim closes were being destroyed to make way for improved accommodation.The extraordinary clarity of many of the -year-old images, taken at a time when photography was still in its infancy, are testament to Annanrsquos technical skill, adds Ms Lyden.ldquoHe was incredibly skilled. The clarity in his images is because he was working with glass plate negatives. He was able to capture a tremendous amount of detail and was able to use dferent processes that he had travelled to Vienna to achieve the rights to use.ldquoHis photographs are evidence of a time past, but also reflect a lot of the same issues that we are dealing with today.Anne Lyden on Thomas Annan is at the Kelvin Hall on Wednesday, August ,at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"reversing-march-time-horology","story":"The watchmakerrsquos art faded with the arrival of quartz and battery-operated timepieces. Digital technology and more recently the continual buzz and beep of smartwatches replaced the traditional mechanical watch, with its skeleton of minuscule screws and intricate moving parts.Even the sprawling Timex factory in Dundee, which at its peak employed more than  people making timepieces to send around the world, couldnrsquot survive the march of time.But times have certainly changed, it seems the gentle art of making wristwatches is now enjoying an albeit small but still remarkable Scottish-led revival.In a workshop at Glasgow Green, ten handmade watches a week are being laboriously crafted, each featuring a prized enamelling technique typically only found in a very select few high-end watchmakersrsquo in Switzerland and Japan.Surrounded by shelves heaving with jewel-coloured enamelling powders, one of horologyrsquos trickiest creative processes ndash the making enamel watch dials in the lsquogrand feursquo tradition, and the task of constructing each watch by hand ndash is being undertaken with painstaking attention to detail.As a result, anOrdain watches with their richly coloured enamel dials ndash made by laying glass powders onto a blank copper disc, firing at high temperatures to melt the powder, cooling it and then firing over and over again to reach the required depth - are flying from his Glasgow workshop.Incredibly, hersquos found some are almost instantly sold on the second-hand market for twice their original four-figure price.One of the beauties of the enamel technique is the depth of colour that comes from multiple layers of glass. ldquoThe melted glass will never, ever lose its colour. It is much better quality than a painted dial that you canrsquot get anywhere , he says.ldquoThere are so few people in the world that can do this, and no-one involved in watchmaking expects a Scottish company to be doing it.But itrsquos not the only Glasgow watch studio seeing rising demand. At design studio Instrmnt in Parnie Street, design team Pete Sunderland and Ross Baynhamrsquos Swiss-movement timepieces have broken into the Japanese market ndash home to some of the biggest watchmaking brands in the world such as Seiko, Citizen and Casio.While celebrities may seek out expensive designer brands to showcase their wealth, Mr Sunderland says others are shting towards a more low-key and unique style statement.ldquoA lot of people are buying watches that donrsquot have that obvious branding they want people to have to ask what brand of watch they are wearing, he says.The firm is now preparing to expand beyond its quartz collection to include traditional mechanical watches and is eyeing the South Korean market.Even the lsquoheritagersquo end of the market appears to be thriving. Alness-based pocket watch business Dalvey has seen such demand for its classic timepieces soar to such an extent that it has recently revived production of classic Albert pocket watch chains, a throwback to the businessrsquos Victorian roots.Mr Heath believes demand for classic wristwatches is being partly driven by people turning away from technology and the constant lsquopingrsquo of text, email and step counters emanating from mobile phones and smartwatches.ldquoPeople are looking for something that will last forever ndash there are very few things in le that are used so much but will be there after you are gone. Itrsquos a very reassuring thing to have, he said.ldquoThey donrsquot have apps or make noises, so you can go for a walk and your watch isnrsquot vibrating, telling you to check emails or texts.The art of grand feu enamelling in watchmaking is carried out by only a tiny handful of highly sophisticated watchmakers in the world because of the highly precise nature of the work and time taken to produce each piece. They include Hermes, which recently launched a grand feu enamel version of its classic Slim DrsquoHermes watches, which instantly added almost pound, to the price tag.In the case of anOrdianrsquos watches, each .mm dial consists of several layers of glass which must be delicately sanded to absolute perfection ndash the slightest kink or warp is discarded. The challenge of conquering the technique took Heath and his team of enamellers almost three years to perfect.The watches are then carefully constructed by one of Scotlandrsquos few watchmakers who, bizarrely, learned the craft by taking a British Horological Institute distance learning course while working as a picker in Amazon.Alan Burtoft of the British Horological Institute says there appears to be a sht in how many consumers are choosing their watch, boosting the once disappearing art of the watchmaker.ldquoWe have seen a steady increase in interest in people looking to learn about watchmaking and clockmaking.ldquoIt may be because people are realising you can make quite a good living from repairing clocks and watches, but there also seems to be a resurgence in interest in mechanical timepieces.ldquoIt could be that people are just fed up with novelty and lsquothrowawayrsquo watches and want something that they can keep."},{"url":null,"title":"new-homes-ensure-salmon-farms-catch-keep-staff","story":"They will be taking possession of four new houses in all, solid semi-detached developments on the edge of one of the most picturesque and popular villages in the Highlands.These are not going to be holiday homes, they are not going to be taken by retirees moving up from the Central Belt or from London, they are not even local housing association properties for those on the housing list.These houses have been bought and signed off by Wester Ross Fisheries, a local salmon farming company so frustrated by the lack of housing for local workers it decided to provide their accommodation itself.:Scotlands Insider Guide: UllapoolThis is a tale repeated right down the west coast of Scotland, through the islands and up into Shetland and Orkney too.On Rum, Mowi ndash Scotlandrsquos biggest salmon company ndash has finished building two kit houses for its workers.But, alongside those properties, Mowi has cleared and serviced two other housing plots.These plots, already fixed up with water, electricity and broadband, are being given to the local community so the islanders can benefit too, by building the houses and either by letting them out or selling them on.Scotlandrsquos salmon companies employ  people in Argyll,  in Highland,  in the Northern Isles and  in the Outer Hebrides.Every one of these workers needs to be accommodated and this is the biggest barrier that Scotlandrsquos salmon companies face when trying to recruit and retain staff.The average wage in the salmon sector is pound,, enough to attract new graduates to move north and to encourage those with specialist skills in marine biology or veterinary science to settle far from the main centres of population.But even these good salaries are often not high enough to break into a housing market inflated by holiday homes, down-sizing retirees and those who can work remotely.Gilpin Bradley, the managing director of Wester Ross Fisheries, said: ldquoHouses are generally unaffordable for young people moving to the area, both in terms of the rent ndash because holiday homes have driven up those prices ndash and for those who want to buy.ldquoThatrsquos why we took the decision to buy these houses and provide subsidised accommodation for our employees.:Opinion: Why community ownership is essential for the future of rural ScotlandThe housing issue is one that every salmon company has found itself embroiled in.They know they are offering good jobs in fabulous locations. They want people to love living and working around the farms but they also know it can be dficult to retain staffthere is hardly any accommodation and what there is, is ropey.Among the new tenants in the Wester Ross Fisheries homes will be young graduates, attracted to Ullapool partly because there was good accommodation to go with an interesting job.These are just the sort of people to help revitalise remote rural communities that the Scottish Government wants to attract.After all, it is only going to be with young people living and working in Scotlandrsquos fragile rural areas that these places are going to have a proper future.One young graduate, working on the salmon farm off the Isle of Muck, says there are also other problems which affect people in the islands, problems most people in urban Scotland donrsquot understand.ldquoTherersquos no such thing as popping to Tesco for a pint of milk, she said.There is no shop on Muck so all food has to be brought over by boat. It is the same for fuel, which means there has to be good organising and stockpiling, plans which go awry when the ferries donrsquot arrive.Then there is broadband. Many of Scotlandrsquos salmon companies have pioneered the installation of superfast internet connections, often using fibreoptic cables, for remote communities.Last year, Scottish Sea Farms worked with broadband provider HebNet CIC to install superfast cover for the residents of the remote Knoydart peninsula and Loch Nevis.Mowi has done the same across the small isles of Muck and Rum, moves which have gone a long way to winning over communities, many of whom are enthusiastic supporters of the salmon companies because they seem to be the only ones putting in the infrastructure.On Rum, for instance, Mowi paid for the installation of a pontoon for visiting yachties with an honesty box at the end. The money collected was then given to the school, to fund trips off the island for the pupils.:Transforming derelict sites \"can promote growth and well-being\"On all the islands where they farm, salmon companies regularly use their boats to help out, bringing building materials from the mainland and even acting as an ambulance service, taking islanders to the mainland for medical help.Scotlandrsquos salmon companies are prepared to step in and provide housing and broadband and other services to remote communities ndash they have certainly shown that.There is obviously a frustration within salmon companies that this responsibility is landing on their shoulders, but there is also a feeling that this is part of the contract they have with local communities, helping out wherever they can.Hamish Macdonell is the director of strategic engagement at Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10292374.jpg?type=article-full","title":"olaf-falafels-joke-top-fringe-funnies","story":"In the past, it has been won by japes about hedgehogs, wry observations on picking a password and one-liners about hoovers.And now Swedish comedian Olaf Falafelrsquos zinger about vegetable-related Tourettersquos, ldquoI keep randomly shouting out Broccoli and Caullower - I think I might have Florets, deemed the funniest joke at the Fringe.:Lonely Planet top  -Edinburgh Fringe is UKs star attractionEach year TV station Dave sends out its experts in search of the festivals best line, before subjecting their picks to a public vote.The Edinburgh Festival is one of the biggest cultural events in the worldOlaf Falafels line received backing from  per cent who deemed it the top tickler after it was nominated from his show Itrsquos One Giant Leek For Mankind.With the goal of finding the wittiest one-liners, an expert  of ten judges was recruited comprising the UKrsquos leading comedy critics.After touring and scouring hundreds of venues and shows at the renowned Edinburgh Festival Fringe Festival, the  submitted their favourite six jokes, listed without naming the comics behind each one, to a vote of , Brits.:Helen Bauer wants to make a scene with first Fringe performance#Winner Olaf Falafel is a surrealist comedian and illustrator.

Take the box indoors away from flies.If the hedgehog isn’t bleeding, offering a warm wrapped hot water bottle is good first aid, but do make sure there is room for it to get offit gets too warm and ensure the bottle is not allowed to go cold.Offer some meaty cat or dog food and water but don’t force feed it.Once you’ve done that, call a local hedgehog rescue centreyou know of one, or BHPS on    for further advice and local contacts.If it’s a baby, Fay says you should check for siblings.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances that led up to the incident\"  Appeal for information following suspicious fire in Peterhead viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"“Hoglets don’t usually come in ones,” she said. “If a hoglet it is trouble, its brothers and sisters may well need help too, so do look around vicinity for others.” She added: “Acting quickly could literally mean the dference between le and death.

Now we want to reach out to the public and local organisations theand breadth of Scotland to get their feedback.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to consider the new strategy and to join the conversation. “The consultation is available online but we will also be going out to communities across rural, island and urban locations in the next  weeks where it would be great to hear as many views as possible.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Colin points out a wall during the Bennachie dig.\"  Open day for people to see dig at Bennachie viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"The strategy aims to protect our climate as well as meeting the needs of its people and businesses.It’s a fine balancing act but the government believes the strategy will tackle climate change, help the economy prosper and improve our health and well-being. There will also be more accountability with proposals for citizens’  and a delivery board.However, the strategy only provides a broad overview of the direction the government is taking, rather than a detailed action plan.Michael explained: “It sets out the direction we will be travelling in for the next  years, with the clear intention that this will not sit on a shelf gathering dust.“The delivery plan, which will be released when the strategy is finalised, will be updated every year to see how much progress has been made on the objectives.“That plan will contain far more detail on what we, as a government, plan to do to meet our targets.”While the government will, of course, lead the way, every Scot has a part to play in the strategy – particularly when it comes to our climate.Michael said: “Scotland has the most ambitious targets for tackling climate change in the world.“The Climate Change Bill, currently before the Scottish Parliament, includes an increased ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a net-zero emissions target by .“Transport is currently the largest contributor to Scottish emissions.“This will be tackled through a range of actions including an ambition to phase out the need for new petrol and diesel cars and vans by .“We will promote and design our transport system so that walking, cycling, public and shared transport are promoted ahead of private car use.“However, we also need to help people make the transition to lower carbon travel – to walk or cycle for short journeys,they are able to, or use public transport ahead of single driver car journeys.“That will not only help to reduce car emissions, which are currently responsible for the most greenhouse gas emissions, but will also help people become more active, improving their health and well-being.“There is no doubt in my mind that our climate is changing. The Beast from the East ably proved that.“It cost the UK economy at least £ billion per day as gridlocked roads and no trains or buses meant many workers were unable to get into work.“We are experiencing more severe winter weather, coupled with summers which are hotter and wetter.“That should serve as a real wake up call to us all that we need to change our behaviours now.“Government has a major part to play but we each also have a personal, inidual responsibility to take action to ensure we minimise the impact that we’re having on the environment.“We have to get this right for future generations, given the impact it could have on their lives.”Michael admits that it may be a struggle to wean people away from their cars.For the car remains the dominant mode of transport in Scotland. In ,  per cent of all journeys were made either as drivers or passengers in a car or a van. This was up from  per cent in  and  per cent in .The proportion of single occupancy car trips also shows an increasing trend. The figure of  per cent in  compares with  per cent in  and  per cent in .But with  per cent of Scotland’s greenhouse gas emissions caused by transport, and cars being responsible for the lion’s share, our love affair with the car has to change.It’s for that reason the Scottish Government is moving fast to rid our streets of petrol and diesel cars.The move to electric cars by  – the most ambitious target in the UK – should help meet the emissions target.It has also recently introduced low emission zones in Glasgow city centre, with Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen set to follow.However, with bus trips also in decline, the government has a major job to do in persuading people to change their habits.Michael said: “We need to encourage people to make greater use of public transport.“That, in turn, will help reduce congestion in our cities and towns – as well as reducing emssions.“A double decker bus can take up to  passengers while occupying little more road space than a single car.“Bus use generally has been in decline since the s for a number of reasons, one being longer journey times caused by congestion on the network.“If we can tackle that, people will be more inclined to travel by bus once again.”Technology, both existing and yet to be dreamed up, will also have a role to play.Michael added: “The rail electrication project proves what we can do – we need to be ready and able to introduce new technologies.“However, what people want today and in  years is the same– linking people and places in ways that are reliable, affordable and safe.“Our strategy will be a catalyst for change. “By focusing on our priorities and delivering the outcomes, Scotland will have a transport system that demonstrates to the world that it is open for business.”The strategy opened for public consultation on Wednesday, July , and will close on Wednesday, October .The consultation team will be going out to train and bus stations across the country in the coming weeks to guage public opinion.Members of the public are also being encouraged to have their say online.Visit consult.gov.scot transport-scotland national-transport-strategy to have your say.

Orkney already generates more than enough renewable energy to meet the needs of our community. The islands are taking a world leading role as a hub for renewables and hydrogen innovation – and for an ever expanding range of research, development and community-led projects.“But we cannot do this alone and continuing support from government will be crucialwe are to overcome the challenges and so make the most of the opportunities for Orkney to take a lead in achieving our shared carbon-neutral ambitions.”He added: “This was a key focus for what were very positive discussions.”During her time in Orkney, Councillor Stockan accompanied the cabinet secretary on a visit to the Kirkwall Harbour Flood Defence Scheme, a £. million project backed by  per cent funding from the Scottish Government.There was also a visit to the project to supply locally produced #green# electrical power to the MV Hamnavoe while docked in Stromness – substantially reducing the ferry’s carbon emissions.In addition, the cabinet secretary saw the work of Kirkwall-based Restart Orkney, a social enterprise which sells good quality second hand furniture and other household items at affordable prices.The venture helps protect the environment, as many of the items would otherwise have ended up being incinerated.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Please feel free to contact us with any questions by phoning  ,# said those involved.A spokesperson for the project went on to say: “A huge thanks to all the landowners who have helped us by agreeing the essential land access we need to get started. With their support together we can protect Orkney’s unique wildle for future generations.”The traps will be laid around  metres apart in preferred stoat habitat, which may include some road verges. They will be checked regularly by the project staff.The Orkney Native Wildle Project is a partnership between Orkney Islands Council, Scottish Natural Heritageand RSPB Scotland. Following three years of development generous support for the project has been provided by, the Heritage Lottery Fund and EU Le, providing a combined grant of £. million for the duration of the five-year project.Stoats are native to the UK Mainland but not to Orkney, where they were first recorded in . Since then the population has increased rapidly and is now fully established and widely-distributed throughout Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay. Those involved said that they are grateful for any sightings of stoats which can be reported via the Stoats in Orkney Facebook page giving a map grid reference.Stoats pose a very serious threat to Orkney#s native wildle particularly the Orkney vole, hen harrier, short-eared owl and other ground nesting birds such as red-throated ers, Arctic terns and curlews for which Orkney is internationally important and upon which Orkney’s thriving wildle tourism industry relies.Keep up to date with the blog ‘Stoat Snippets’, the Orkney Native Wildle Project Facebook page at www.facebook OrkneyNativeWildleProject or visit www.ONWP.orgcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

To make sure you can have your say at future elections, simply check the form you receive and respond as soon as possible.“All responses can now be made online and we would encourage householders, where possible, to use this method rather than ing the form in the post.”People who have changed address recently are particularly encouraged to keep an eye out for the form and check the details.Research by the independent Electoral Commission indicates that recent home movers are far less likely to be registered than those who have lived at the same address for a long period of time.Across the UK,  per cent of people who have been at their property for more than sixteen years will be registered, compared to  per cent of people who have lived at an address for less than a year.Further information about registering to vote is available on the Electoral Commission website at https:www.yourvotematters Any residents who have any questions can contact the Electoral Registration Office at  Broad Street, Kirkwall.

The truth is that quite a few of us at Westminster have been trying to do that for the past year.Groups of Liberal Democrat, Labour, Conservative, even SNP MPs have been meeting regularly to work on common ground and an approach which puts the country before inidual party interest.Jeremy Corbyn has not been part of those discussions.: Jo Swinson ‘daft’ to oppose Jeremy Corbyn plan to stop no deal Brexit, says Nicola SturgeonFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereIndeed, for most of the past year I could not have told you where the Labour frontbench stood on Brexit. Were they for it  Against no-deal  Supporting Remain  We all know their policy descriptor has been ‘constructive ambiguity’. I would agree with half of that statement, and it is certainly not the word ‘constructive’.There have, of course, been Labour and former Labour MPs who have been more than happy working to find a common route forward. One of them was Chuka Umunna. And former Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston was another who was prepared to search for that consensus.Signicantly, both of them now sit as Liberal Democrats. They will be joined on the yellow benches after recess by Parliament’s newest MP, Jane Dodds.She was the Lib Dem victor in the recent Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, when Remain parties worked together to put the country’s interest before that of our inidual parties. Which brings me back to exactly what the country is crying out for: consensus.This past week Jo Swinson argued that what we need now is a vote of no-confidence to replace this Boris-led administration with a government of national unity.In her first major keynote speech since becoming leader, she laid out the case that the Prime Minister’s determination to leave on  October “do or die” is utterly irresponsible.She described a no-deal Brexit as bad for the NHS, bad for the rural economy and bad for our family of nations in the United Kingdom.: Jeremy Corbyn: ‘It’s not up to Jo Swinson to decide next PM’And she said that to be certain of preventing that no-deal outcome we need a successful vote of no confidence in Johnson’s administration.Then, within  days we need to install a temporary cross-party government with an alternative Prime Minister who has the confidence of the House and will stop a no-deal Brexit.We are facing a national emergency and we need an emergency government to resolve it. What she didn’t say, and what caused an immediate angry reaction from the left, is that Jeremy Corbyn should be that alternative Prime Minister.The reason for that is simple: he does not have the numbers. He is unable to command the support of enough MPs across the House to make that happen.Of course, Nicola Sturgeon has said that her MPs would support Jeremy Corbyn – just a week after his sidekick John McDonnell made it clear that a future Labour government would be happy to see another independence referendum in Scotland.But where there is reticence to back a party leader who has found it dficult to command the support of many of his own MPs throughout this parliament.It would need Conservative MPs to back a man they have already failed to find a compromise with on Brexit. Would they not all be more likely to back someone seen to be above party politics Which brings me back to Ken Clarke and Harriet Harman.Surely either of them, or perhaps another political grandee, has the reputation and respect to galvanise Tory rebels, Labour Remainers, Liberal Democrats, SNP, Plaid Cymru, Caroline Lucas and the independents.It does have to be all of them, because that is the only way that it can succeed. AndMr Corbyn genuinely wants that to happen surely even, he can see that he should agree to someone  leading it.This should not be about personalities, or inidual parties, but about finding a way that actually works. Don’t get me wrong. If Mr Corbyn can somehow overcome the past two years and suddenly command cross-party support in the House and successfully steer us away from the clf-edge, I would be happy.But so far, I see no prospect of that, and we do not have time to wait and seehe can. The clock is ticking, and we are getting ever closer to that clf-edge.We need that vote of no confidence, we need that unity government and we need to take this back to the people to be sure of what they really want.Most of all we need to avoid the no-deal that would be so disastrous for all of us. In pursuing that solution Jo Swinson and the Liberal Democrats have only one red line. It has to be a proposal that can work.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch a modern highland clearance is being hidden behind a population boom in inverness","story":"The Highlands population boom is happening in its cities and towns, masking on-going problems, writes Lesley Riddoch. There’s plenty of good news for the Highlands and Islands.Visitor numbers are up. Orkney leads the sht to electric cars and renewable energy. And now, Spain Greece and Croatia are so impressed with Highland and Islands Enterprisethey plan to set up similar growth-creating quangos of their own.Why  Because the Highlands has reversed centuries of population decline to regain its ’s total of , folk - and these southern EU member states believe HIE and its predecessor the Highlands and Islands Development Board are largely responsible.Now it would be churlish not to express delight that the “basket-case” Highlands have proved doubters wrong. HIE and more particularly the HIDB have indeed pump-primed much of that economic development and the University of the Highlands and Islands, with its digital learning and dispersed campuses, has been another positive development.But it would be mistaken to presume the job-creating quangos have single-handedly produced a miraculous pan-Highland population increase - as I think they would be first to admit. It would be wrong to presume population growth is happening beyond Highland towns and cities like Inverness, Aviemore, Nairn, Dingwall, Fort William, Oban, Kirkwall, Lerwick and Portreewrong to presume that the region’s age profile is irrelevant and absolutely wrong to think the  population total is as good as the Highlands and Islands can get.While the population of Highland towns is growing, more remote areas are facing a modern clearance thanks to long-term leases for locals being replaced with short-term lets for tourists unaffordable land and empty glens caused by Scotland’s archaic land ownership patterns the loss of East-European seasonal labour endangering seasonal businesses worry over the impending impact of Brexit-related tarfs on fisheries and agricultural produce and cuts in services like public transport, elderly care and childcare - until recently there was just one nursery in the whole of Sutherland. It would be troublingthe decision to use HIE as a role model by Mediterranean states, gave the impression that all’s well in Highlandand prompted Scots to question the need for urgent action to stop another generation of young Highland Scots giving up and moving out. Yesterday, a Sunday newspaper spent five pages questioning the success of community landownership in Scotland on the basis of one problematic forestry scheme on Bute. Is this really the Highlands’ biggest issue  What’s needed is a wider perspective. Firstly, urban growth can easily conceal the hard fact that half an hour down the road, “remote” Highland and Island communities are really struggling.Last year a report by the James Hutton Institute predicted the working age population in Scotland’s rural areas will plummet by a third by , pushing communities in remote corners of the Highlands and Islands into a “spiral of decline.” It found “sparsely populated areas” - defined as those more than half an hour away from a town of , folk - account for almost half of Scotland’s land mass, but just . per cent of Scotland’s population. These places are projected to lose more than a quarter of their population in the next  years, with Western Isles, Argyll and the Southern Uplands among the worst affected. Yet the picture is so dferent in the Highland capital. In , the population of Inverness was ,. In  it was almost ,, with a quarter of the Highland population living in or around it. So, let’s call a spade a spade. The Inverness Black Isle Nairn corridor is doing well - picking up southerners looking for the best quality of le in the UK and young Highlanders pushed out of more remote glens - not because land there is irredeemably infertile and fit only for use as a grouse moor, rich man’s playground or re-wilding but because centuries of paternalistic ownership mean there’s no available, affordable land, therefore no affordable housing and therefore no feasible way for younger folk to take advantage of the jobs and business opportunities that absolutely do exist. Planning presumptions all too often mirror that man-made, unnatural emptiness. So, let’s think again about the levels of population we should expect in the Highlands and Islands and reconsider the date chosen to illustrate the scale of the present population surge.The s saw the Highlands on its collective knees after seventy years of clearance and widespread starvation as a result of the potato famine. Is this a suitable benchmark for the carrying capacity of the scenic, energy-rich, culturally-vibrant region today We should be comparing and contrasting the Highlands and Islands not with the region’s own broken past but with the thriving present of its neighbours - like Tromso, the capital of Arctic Norway. Situated on an island amidst barren fjords, it lies more than a thousand miles north of Inverness. Yet the population of this truly remote city matches the Highland capital with , folk. Arctic Bodø has . residents, Alta , and sub-Arctic Trondheim a whopping , residents.The relatively high population base of remote Northern Norway has been achieved not by the actions of specic quangos, but by the fact Norway escaped feudalism, therefore has the largest and most erse number of inidual landowners in Europe and land prices that are a fraction of those demanded for the tiny parcels available in Highland Scotland. Folk in Northern Norway were also aided by the abolition of nobility in , the nationalisation of rivers for hydro power straight after independence and a long tradition of ultra-local democratic control which prompted investment in light industry.Let’s be clear. Scotland’s community buyouts have boosted highland and island populations and provided jobs with secure, affordable and properly insulated homes in remote areas where private owners miserably failed. The problem is that rural Scotland cannot be fixed, acre by acre, or buyout by buyout. Community control delivers speedy relief for the communities able to jump hurdles and take over control, but places a strain on volunteers and leaves Scotland’s highly dysal systems of land ownership and distant democratic control unchanged and intact. So, let’s imagine what the Highlands might look likeHolyrood and Westminster politicians were as bold as community activists, delivering the modern equivalent of the Crofting Acts, or the high rates of taxation that prompted one-fth of Scottish land to be sold in the s or Tom Johnston’s hydro-electric revolution in the s.The Highlands urgently needs release from outdated feudal structures to grow sustainably. Governments not quangos can deliver.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"the scotsman says any future independence referendum must pose the right question","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Doubtless, it is a development that will frustrate supporters of independence but we believe the Electoral Commission is correct to intervene in discussions over the staging of a second referendum on Scotland#s place in the UK.The elections watchdog’s insistence it must be allowed to assess the question that would be asked may prevent First Minister Nicola Sturgeon from staging the quick-fire referendum she desires but recent experience tells us a careful approach to such votes is essential.The commission – which has also proposed a y timeframe for the staging of any second referendum – has called for a series of changes to Scottish Government legislation, paving the way for Indyref. Perhaps the most problematic issue is the proposed wording of any referendum question. The Scottish Government has proposed the commission should not, where it has previously been involved in assessing the question asked of voters, have any further input. This would mean the First Minister could simply ask the same question – should Scotland be an independent country  – as in . However, the commission ruled out a Yes No question in ’s EU referendum, insisting a question to which the answer was either Leave or Remain was more balanced.The Scotsman will take no position during a future independence referendum campaign but it is our view that such a vote must be scrupulously fair, with the wording of the question giving no advantage to either side. We are also in favour of the commission’s proposal for greater controls over campaign spending and tougher powers to deal with any breaches of financial limits. It is clear that regulation of spending during the EU referendum was not as strict as it should have been and damaging ‘grey areas’ were allowed to develop.Nicola Sturgeon and her supporters hunger for a referendum in the next year. The chances of this happening were always going to be slender. The Conservative Government has, after all, repeatedly made clear its opposition to a second vote on independence.The First Minister may see the opportunity to make political capital from this latest apparent road block but we hope she, and all political leaders, will engage with the Electoral Commission to ensure that – should it take place – the next referendum on Scottish independence is scrupulously fair.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"parents share update on fate of boy 6 who fell five storeys from tate modern","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The child, who was visiting from France, suffered injuries including a brain bleed and spinal, leg and arm fractures after being allegedly thrown by a -year-old boy from a th-floor viewing  at the art gallery on August .His parents issued a statement to the organiser of a fundraising page set up on their behalf which has received donations of almost £,.They said: \"Our son has already undergone two long and dficult operations. - Mice droppings and mould found at Michelin-starred The Kitchin in Edinburgh\"He is stabilised, but we still do not know the full extent and severity of his injuries.

It is customary, indeed a pre-requisite, that before great battles commence there is no limit to intentionally circulating misinformation of what one force or another intends to do.Deception can take the shape of an error not meant to break the surface. One such was Operation Mincemeat, where before the invasion of Sicily both Churchill and Eisenhower approved the use of a dead London tramp’s body to play the role of a Royal Marine carrying sensitive documents that were of course . Washed up on the Spanish shore the secrets carried by “The Man who never was” had the effect of directing Axis troop deployments to Greece and Sardinia but crucially not Sicily. That Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond but back then working for naval military intelligence, had a hand in the ruse has since given the escapade its own notoriety.Alternatively intentionally revealing plans that apparently cannot be hidden but are in reality feints on a grand scale to throw opponents off might be deployed. One such example was Operation Fortitude’s phantom armiesdesigned to convince Nazi Germany’s High Command that the Normandy landings were themselves only a ersionary tactic. These deceptions are not just deployed during war but happen regularly in commerce, such as announcing the end of a particular brand or recipe for a brand so that the kickback from distressed loyal customers creates a higher media profile that raises sales. The proposed changes are then withdrawn in response to “customer demand” and all is well with the world.• : Corbyn can’t be national unity PM, he can barely keep Labour together – Christine JardineThroughout le we are met with deceptions that are meant to distract us from a larger event or simply manage our expectations. It is the stuff of pulp fiction in romance, crime thrillers and political tussles. That it should happen now during the preparations of the UK’s expected exit from the European Union should be a surprise to no one – but many shall be fooled.Will there be some disruption brought about by the changes known and unknown  Of course, just as there was when decimalisation changed the way we counted our money and weighed our goods – or when we entered the European Economic Community. There were some who sought to exploit each change for their own benefit by raising prices under the guise of greater costs or changes in supply. So we can expect some disruption and we can expect some among us to seek to take advantage from it, be it commercial or political – but their motives in most cases will be blindingly obvious.So this past week we have had much manufactured fog descend upon us to confuse us and deceive us as Brexit approaches. Some authors of this  fog wish to create fake news to scare a nervous public into the remainer camp. Some, such as the incredulous worst case scenario “Yellowhammer” report that appeared in the Sunday papers has all the look of an attempt to manage expectations by exaggerating what impact “No Deal” will have. There is no need for a hard border between Ireland and the UK. Thanks to the use of existing customs practice we will have no need of it, the Irish have said they will not erect one – so it will be for the EU to impose one. Let us see who’s been lying to the public, fomenting ision and heightening tension. As I have said in this column before, Keep Calm and Carry On, Brexit is coming deal or no deal.• : Brexit: Boris Johnson to tell Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron that there must be a new dealAs examples of the fog of war go, any talk of a government of “national unity” is a real pea-souper. How could it be unying  It would seek to stop the Prime Minister respecting the outcomeof the greatest democratic event in our history. It would mean a cabinet composed entirely of remain-supporting MPs, for how could any leave support in all conscience be part of it  It would mean government by parliament rather than an executive scrutinised and held to account by parliament – so who would scrutinise and hold parliament to account The majority of the British people would have their wish torpedoed by politicians, the vast majority of whom were elected promising to honour the referendum and deliver Brexit. There would be no national unity, there would be greater ision than we even know today with democracy tossed on a bonfire of broken promises and political self-interest. Any election that followed would no longer be about parties or even policies but about the new ide of the people versus parliament. A government of National Unity is so oxymoronic as to be decidedly and repulsively Orwellian.Jeremy Corbyn tried to take advantage of this political disarray in Westminster by offering himself up as the potential caretaker prime minister but so transparent was this tactic that it dissolved on launch. Maybe one day it will be made into a film entitled “The prime minister who never was”. The illiberal undemocratic leader Jo Swinson offered up Labour’s Harriet Harman and Conservative Ken Clarke as alternatives – and they obliged by preening themselves before the media­ – but they too are being met with derision. Clarke might at least attract some of the necessary Conservative support – but really  His role as former Deputy-Chairman of British American Tobacco led George Monbiot to argue he was unfit for office  The Chancellor who wanted to increase VAT on fuel, but when defeated raised the tax on whisky – and the health minister with a record of abusing workers rights second to none.

They raised more than pound,.This year the family are hoping to raise money for the Macmillan charity.The attraction reopened last Wednesday, August  with visitors advised to dress for the rather unpredictable weather.The McAllister family helped spread a little bit of sunshine late last year as , tiny seeds planted in Spring blossomed into huge bursts of yellow sunflowers.The McAllisters created a spectacular attraction with their wildflower meadow and sunflower display, which saw people from far and wide descend upon the field to view the stunning blooms.Damian sowed the seed at the end of May utilising an old technique of sowing with a fiddle.One acre is devoted to wildflowers, with intricate hues of yellows, purples and reds while the huge sunflowers take up two acres.Damian’s we, Karen, told thelast year that the field was only supposed to be open for two days but due to its popularity they decided to keep it open.SUPPORT  She said: “We have been overwhelmed at how much support we have received. We have been so busy and people just keep on coming.“My husband planted the seeds in late May and the conditions, with the warm weather and rain, have ensured they have flourished.“They are continuing to bloom and the children who visit absolutely love it.“It is good fun, they can play games like hide and seek. But, it’s educational too.“They can learn about nature and see the flowers as well as ladybirds and bumble bees!“We have even been in touch with the local Beekeepers Association.“There are a number of ieties of flowers here including Corn Cockle, Marigolds, Chamomiles and Cornflower.“There are , sunflowers with the tallest so far reaching ft!“Karen revealed that she had received a request from a bride who wished to have her wedding pictures at the field and an  year old lady told her she hadn’t seen a field of sunflowers like this since she was in her s in France!Karen said: “The reception to this has been totally unexpected but it’s been great!”Eamonn McAllister, owner of the land, said: “Usually we don’t have the climate here for the sunflowers but they have bloomed this year.“It was a novel idea and we have been very busy with visitors from all over.”News of the Sunflower Fields reopening has been causing a flurry on social media, with visitors eager to get snapped with the blooms.The Sunflower Field is situated about three miles from the centre of Portglenone, on the left hand side of the Gortgole Road.

Neils grandmother is in the centre of the centre row.He said: “A good friend of mine owned a bar in Dromore, she gave me an old bottle that said ‘ginger beer’ on it. It was meant as a joke because I’m ginger, but it ended up starting a fascination with bottles.“I started looking into where the bottles were made and background to them.“My original intent was to collect a bottle from every county, but soon I found out there are a lot of bottles out there, probably  known bottles. They are very dficult to find. I would hunt through antique shops, flea markets, auctions and that type of thing. You also pick some up by word of mouth or even dig them up from an old dump site.“My collection ranges from Coleraine to Cork, but a number of local bottles have eluded me. I am aware of bottles from Lurgan, Portadown and Banbridge but am yet to locate these.

No two bottles are the same due to the processes involved, but the minor flaws are what add to their charm. “Historically stone bottles were gradually replaced by mass produced glass bottles, the result of which is that many of these were buried in landfill sites or dumped in rivers and canals and can be dficult to locate.”Neil added: “I’ve always had a big interest in local social history, these stoneware bottles are part of it. I have been working hard in documenting the past so that it can be preserved for future generations. “I have amassed a collection of local items, everything from clocks to water pumps, but there are a few items that I have struggled to find.

speaks on his","story":"THE mother of -year-old Gerald McAuley who was shot dead by a loyalist gunman in August  says she has never felt any hatred towards the man who took her son’s le. While helping families move out of the burned streets of Clonard, Gerald, a member of the Fianna youth, was shot dead by on Waterville Street, not far from his Colinward Street family home. During the Scarman tribunal, an acting superior of Clonard Monastery spoke of how he had given Gerald and three others hit by shotgun blasts the last rites. Gerald was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital where he was pronounced dead at .pm. The tribunal concluded he had been shot by a Protestant gunman. Speaking to the Andersonstown News Gerald’s -year-old mother Nellie spoke of how her second oldest child was born on the Feast of St Gerard and how much he loved fishing, birds, motor racing and bikes. “I remember when Gerald left school, he went to St Thomas’, he got himself a job in a factory in Northumberland Street. I remember he was working in it around three weeks and he came home and said ‘Mummy, the boss wants to see you.’ The first thing I asked was ‘What have you done ’ I went down and the man praised Gerald, how much of a good, clean worker he was and told me how much he had in common with his own sons. He told me how he wanted Gerald to go to the Tech come September but that Gerald had told him how he wanted to join the Irish Merchant Navy when he came of age. I saidthat’s his wish I can’t hold him back.”Nellie spoke of how on August   she had gone out to look for Gerald as he hadn’t come home.Telling how fraught the roads around Kashmir, Falls and Albert Street had become as violence flared around her and her son Jim as they looked for Gerald. “I remember Gerald came in around am that night and went to bed. I got up the next morning to go to work, I worked in C#A as a cleaner and I turned on the news. It was saying about Patrick Rooney, Trooper McCabe and the fella, the bus driver from Ardoyne who had been killed. I came home later that day and Gerald was in the house with his friend. I said to him ‘Waren’t you in work ’ He said ‘Mummy, there is no work, it’s gone, it’s away.’ He went straight out again and that was the last I saw him.”Nellie said she went out to look for Gerald as trouble continued to flare and found herself at the City Hospital. “I remember the Sister on the ward brought me into the office and I said to her that I was looking for my son. She went out and came back and I will always remember how she said ‘No mother, he’s not here, there’s only a boy of around  in Musgrave.’ I said that’s him, that’s Gerald. “Gerald was a big lad, he had it in the shoulders, he had a big frame and he wore a size  shoe. I remember later a priest being on the other side of the street from our house, he was wearing a heavily beaded vest, a beret and a stick and said ‘Mrs McAuley your son has gone to Heaven,’ then he turned on his heel and walked away.”Following Gerald’s death Nellie recalled her feelings: “You’re here and you’re not here. About six weeks after Gerard was buried we were invited up to the old Felons at the side of the cemetery and that night they had a colour party come on the stage and said that night that Gerard was in the Fianna from  years old. Looking back on it Gerald asked me could he go away for a week with the boys out of school. I remember he said he needed five shillings and could I give it to him. He said he needed an enamel plate, cup, mug and even then the penny didn’t drop. I brought him down to Millets and we got the plate, everything. The fella in the shop said he would need a wee container to carry his eggs in and we got that as well. Soon after he came in to say ‘Mummy I’m awful sorry some of the boys couldn’t get their money and couldn’t go.’ I don’t know how long after that then he did go.”  years on from the anniversary of Gerald’s death on Thursday, Nellie reflected how she “wasn’t ing right” half a century ago.” “I never had any hatred. Gerald died on the Feast of the Assumption, August , that’s Her day, he was taken on Her day and that’s the way I looked at it.” A wreath-laying ceremony for Gerald McAuley will take on Friday, August  at .pm in Bombay Street Memorial Garden.

Fans will be treated to singles Feel the Raindrops, Your Greatest Shade of Blue and s classic Broken Land – the ‘most played song on Radio ’ during that particular year. With just over two weeks to go until they tak the stage, songwriter Pat Gribben told the Andersonstown News that he along with the rest of the band are “looking forward” to the August  gig. “Of course it’s always nice to be asked,” said Pat, “I’m looking forward to catching up with Brian Kennedy. I played guitar with Brian and haven’t seen him since his illness and now that he is cancer free, it will be good to see him.”On composing one of the most iconic songs of the s, Broken Land, Pat explained how he had been “messing about” on producer Garry Bell’s keyboards. “I got my daughter to school that Monday morning and the main part of the song was done that day,” he said.Still heavily rotated on airwaves  plus years later, Pat said there are lots of songs written that could appear on a new Adventures album. “I think we are playing better now than back in the day, I don’t know why, maybe we are all more experienced.

From  stylish bedrooms, a stunning bar with an extensive drinks and cocktails menu and even an eye-catching garden and bridal suite, the Lansdowne has it all.As for grub, the Lansdowne caters for diners from AM to PM and a recent Thursday lunchtime visit for myself and two colleagues offered us the chance to sample some dishes from their lunch menu.The menu is made up of light bites, small plates and main plates so your choice depends on just how hungry you are and how much time you have. We were greeted and shown to our table by their new yet welcoming staff and joined for lunch on this occasion by co-owner Jim McLaughlin who took little time in doing the work for us by selecting some of his favourite and most popular dishes from across the lunch menu. Jim’s background is in food, so we had no hesitation he would deliver the right goods to the table.It wasn’t long before our huge selection of grub arrived in front of us and left us with the question, where to begin We were served three main plates – the larger courses on the Lansdowne lunch menu. First up was the simple yet classic Chicken Caesar salad – a generous portion of sliced chargrilled chicken mixed in with maple-cured bacon lardons, baby gem lettuce, garlic focaccia croutons and lashed with parmesan shavings drizzled in Caesar dressing. Often known as the not so healthy salad option for dieters, it would have been rude not to try this classic and spoonful after spoonful, the smorgasbord of flavours really came out. The next main plate was the duck confit, served on a bed of sweet potato mash, green beans with a dash of herb butter and red wine jus. For me, it was quite the standout dish and as a duck lover, it hit all the right spots from the crispiness on the outside to the easily torn-off meat on the inside, all brought to le by the sweet potato mash and red wine jus.The last of the main plates was my colleague’s definition of heaven – a huge pot of steamed mussels in garlic and white wine cream and served with rosemary and red onion focaccia bread. A massive lover of all things fish, the silence at the table was noticeable as she made her way through the portion, which, priced at just £, could easily be shared amongst two.Also served up on this lunchtime occasion was a selection of small plates which are proving the most popular choice od customers, according to Jim. Small plates are exactly what they say on the tin and take a form similar to Spanish tapas, meaning they are ideal to share. Customers can choose  for £,  for £ or  for £ so whether you want a nibble over a drink or simply can’t choose and need to try a few, the world is your oyster at the Lansdowne.For me, the stand-out small plate was the crispy pork belly with a layer of caramel apple sauce. Pork belly is one of my favourite things and, having previously worked in a Chinese restaurant, I am all too familiar with it and this did not disappoint.Another triumph was the firecracker chicken wings, served with a blue cheese dip. The wings were a perfect combination of a fiery wsoon overtaken by the wonderful dip – I would highly recommend.The brie also deserves a paragraph to itself because it was simply mouth-watering. A crispy shell was soon followed by the delicious melted delight that is brie but the dish was really taken to the next level by the homemade blackcurrant gel and it is not dficult to see why it is the most popular side dish order, according to Jim.Also served to us on small plates was the crispy beef: large chunks of beef brisket which were cooked to perfection and beautully seasoned with pickled carrot and a tastebud tingling Asian dressing which ensured the beef inside the crispiness was moist and melting.The deep fried salt and chilli squid was equally as good and something I also adore – well, anything salt and chilli really. The squid was fresh, fried expertly and served with a napa salad, harissa mayo, coriander and sesame seeds, it would put some Chinese restaurants’ attempt at the dish to shame.The small plates were a huge success on our visit and enjoyed in the impressive surroundings of the stylish bar, for me it was exactly how ‘bar food’ should be – in fact, it was on another level. I cannot wait to try some of the other small plates which include spicy Italian meatballs, crab bruscietta and sweet potato bhajis. The main plates were mighty fine too and maybe with a cocktail or two the next time. I am already looking forward to planning my next lunchtime visit to the Antrim Road’s famous stalwart.

has rejected the findings of a poll which revealed that almost three out of five voters in Northern Ireland would prefer a border down the Irish Sea to a hard Brexit.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the idea that more people here would rather remain closely aligned with the EU than the UK is in no way reflective of the community he represents.The survey carried out by Belfast-based polling and market research company LucidTalk asked people how they would vote in a referendum proposing that Northern Irelandremained aligned to the European Union, \"perhaps staying in the single market and the customs union\".Read MoreDire Brexit warnings of no-deal listed in leaked document dismissed by DUPAlex Kane: Boris Johnson could be tempted by Brexit backstop only for Northern IrelandCorbyn: Brexit

the response, unionist voters were largely opposed to the prospect of breaking away from the United Kingdom in favour of the EU, with some % of Democratic Unionists and % of Ulster Unionists rejecting the idea.However, Sir Jeffrey questioned the level of support for staying aligned with the EU indicated by the LucidTalk poll, saying it contrasts with the views of his constituents in Lagan Valley.\"These polls by LucidTalk I dont think accurately reflect opinion,\" he told the Belfast .\"Their polling methods are not reflective of the wider community, especially on the unionist side.\"In contrast to the  of people that they poll, the people that I talk to in my own constituency do not share that view at all. data-dfpadtargetingSir Jeffrey Donaldson\"A clear majority of them would not support Northern Ireland being separated from the UK.\"As the UK hurtles towards its exit from the European Union, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said will go ahead with or without a deal on October , experts have warned that at least , jobs could be at risk in Northern Irelandan agreement is not reached.Sir Jeffrey said the survey has no bearing on his partys position of opposing the backstop and protecting links with the United Kingdom. data-dfpadtargetingMartina Anderson\"We believe that it is not in Northern Irelands best interests, economically or in any other way, to be torn away from Great Britain,\" he continued.He said the UK is one of the largest economies in the world.\"We export far more goods to Great Britain than we do to the rest of the world, including the EU combined, so I dont think it is a credible or rational approach that we should create barriers between ourselves and what is by far our biggest market.\" However, nationalist politicians said the poll is an accurate reflection of public opinion in Northern Ireland and comes as no surprise.An overwhelming number of nationalists opted for closer alignment with the EU, with % of Sinn Fein and SDLP voters who responded to the poll backing the Northern Ireland only backstop.Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson said the survey reinforces her view that more people would prefer a united Ireland as a means to staying within the EU than a potentially catastrophic crash-out.\"Opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the majority are in support of a pathway back into the EU,\" she said.\"I think we need to acknowledge that the vast majority of people in the north voted against Brexit.\"If faced with the choice, they would prefer an enhanced border in the Irish Sea.\"Ms Anderson added: \"If unionists are surprised, they dont have their finger on the pulse of the people that they represent,\" she said.\"The majority of the people quite clearly dont want to see a hardened border.\"Also responding to the survey, SDLP Brexit spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said his only surprise is that the number of people who favour a border in the Irish Sea over a potential hard Brexit is not higher.\"Brexit has been an absolute calamity which looks about to end in a disastrous no-deal,\" the West Tyrone MLA said.\"This will be bad for business, trade and commerce.\"It will especially hit people hard along the border.\"A united Ireland has become a reality for many now and not just an aspiration.\"It should be no surprise to anyone that a further majority wants to avoid a hard border on this island that would interrupt integrated supply chains, damage our economy and bring hardship to border communities.\"Its sadly also no surprise that the DUP continues to ignore the wishes of most people.\"The Tory-DUP Government at Westminster has no mandate for a no-deal exit.\"The majority of middle ground voters also supported the compromise, with % of Alliance voters and % Green Party voters backing the proposition."},{"url":null,"title":"backlash as linfield consider ditching no sunday games rule","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

But Linfield chiefs feel that -they reach the group stages of the Europa League - their team will need an extra day to recover from their Thursday night fixture before playing again.Hence the proposal to move Saturday games to Sundays, despite the long-standing Never On A Sunday rule in its constitution.Mr McGivern said: \"To reach the group stages would be huge for the club and many things need to be taken into consideration.\"We will have extra games - and that will have an impact in terms of scheduling our league matches.\"We cant play home games at Windsor Park on a Sunday because of a club rule. \"Will we have to change that  Probably, but our members will decide that.\"Linfield can play away on a Sunday but there must be a rule change for a home fixture.\"We will be a few games behind other sides and thats the price for being successful in Europe.\"The whole image of the club will be lted and theres obvious financial benefits.\"However, possible change to the clubs constitution has been criticised by North Antrim MLA Mr Allister. \"I think it will be a retrograde step,\" Mr Allister said.\"Theyve had that rule for a very long time. \"To use the exigency of this present situation as an excuse for changing it permanently I think would be inappropriate - and out of keeping with the culture and tradition of Irish League football.\"The ban on Sunday football matches was lted by the Irish Football Association only in , despite protests from the DUP and evangelical campaigners, including the Free Presbyterian Church.The first match held on a Sunday since the ban was lted was an Irish Premiership match between Glentoran and Bangor at The Oval in Belfast.See back page for full story"},{"url":null,"title":"bidders for harland and wolff shipyard valid and credible mp says","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I always thought Canada was a better country, I had this illusion.”He said he hoped that Canada would take him, but accepted that he could well be jailedhe were ever to get there.But he asked: “If I’m really a Canadian citizen, why haven’t they taken me by now ”When askedhe had anything to say to Boris Johnson, Letts said: “What would I say to him directly “I don’t know, I don’t think he’ll see thisI say anything anyway.“I think Boris Johnson is ridiculous, to be honest, I think most of the British population do.“It’s amazing he actually became prime minister.”His parents, John Letts and Sally Lane, said yesterday that the British Government was “shirking responsibility” by revoking their son’s citizenship.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  John Letts and Sally Lane Mr Letts, , told Channel  News: “I thought British citizens had certain rights.

I can’t even speak to my mum so how can I speak to a lawyer ”Letts described his decision to travel to Syria as a “stupid mistake” but insisted he had only gone to fight Bashar Assad’s regime.“I never killed anyone, I never took someone a slave. I only ever fought the Syrian regime which killed one million people,” he said.“I’m not a murderer. I’ve never tortured anyone. I’m just a person who made a stupid mistake.”Earlier this year, the Government decided to strip -year-old Shamima Begum of her citizenship after she was discovered in a refugee camp.Begum left her home in Bethnal Green with two friends aged just  in February  to join Islamic State.Following the decision to revoke Lett’s citizenship, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: “Whenever there are reasonable grounds to suspect that someone who is entitled toto this country has either committed or facilitated acts of terrorism, they should be fully investigated and where appropriate prosecuted.“We are not in favour of making people stateless, that’s a punishment without due process.“Simply removing citizenship may please ministers, but it isn’t justice in any sense.“Government ministers shouldn’t offload Britain’s responsibilities to other countries. We have a duty to deal with these cases ourselves, in line with international law.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sir elton johns friendship with the royal family","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I make a reference to my go-to sound engineer  Gerry Craig  being a past pupil and so continues a ream of well-known characters in the local and national music scene who are former students of MAPA including  Roe, Ports, Soak, Touts, Balkan Alien Sound, Cherym, Sugarwolf, New Pagans  and  Foreign Owl. Grainne  continues that “once past levels  and  there are pathways for students to continue performing or to get into the technological side of the arts after which students do a HNC or HND which they can then top up to full honours degree at Leeds Beckett, Leeds College of Music or Paisley.

They also claimed that the deceased Creggan man suffered further injuries as he fell to the ground on a laneway outside St Marys Church in the estate.However, Seamus Bradleys family repeatedly maintained that he died later having been taken away from the scene in an army saracen and sustained fatal injuries whilst being subjected to torture during interrogation.The Coroner, Judge Patrick Kinney, however ruled out both versions of the events at Laganside Court in Belfast last Thursday . The judge said he was satisfied that Seamus Bradley was killed by a soldier who got out of a Saracen, fell to one knee and opened fire, but added that he had been unable to identy the soldier responsible for the shooting.“He was running across an open area of ground, he had no weapon and he was clearly visible,” Mr Kinney said.The Coroner also concluded that the deceased man could not have reasonably been percieved as posing a threat of death or serious injury to the soldiers in the Army vehicle nor to anyone  and that the use of force by the soldier was “entirely disproportionate to any threat that could have been perceived.”Furthermore, Mr Kinney said, there was no first aid or medical assistance provided by the soldiers, butit had been there was a “reasonable prospect” that Seamus Bradley would have survived. The judge also concluded the victim was not mistreated by British Army personnel in the Saracen either by physical assault, torture or shooting.Seamus Bradleys brother Danny who has pursued the case for decades told the Derry News: “First of all I would like to make a statement referring to my brothers first inquest in . The prosecution showed a black and white picture to the jury and then turned to my father and called him a liar and said your son was not tortured.“This same man was aware that there were coloured pictures showing that Seamus neck was badly marked and which the black and white images failed to show.“Seamus was stripped naked and badly beaten about the face and shot three times at close range. At the original inquest one soldier claimed that Seamus fell out of the Saracen onto his face, but the army medical officer said that never happened.“Sadly, the police at the time did not show the Bradley family any of the pictures and it took to  for the police to show nine black and white pictures. Then in  the Coroners office showed us  coloured pictures. It can be safely be said that both the black and white and coloured pictures went missing to save the security forces embarrassment.”Danny Bradley also told the Derry News: “I have mixed emotions but I achieved what I set out to do. That was to clear Seamus name and thats what matters. Its not about me.”“I also intend to send the Inquest report to the Irish Government as well as the independent ballistics report because this was a war crime. My brother was a soldier, a volunteer in the Provisional IRA. His papers were logged under war file by the British Government and they have broken the Geneva Convention becuase they had declared war on the IRA.“By doing so they must take responsibility for and due care of their prisoners and I will be asking for a proper investigation-something which the state failed to deliver in .”In  the former Historical Enquiries Team in their examination of the Bradley case concluded that the British Army,they were telling the truth, had acted lawfully with respect to his killing, but added that the death had never been “effectively investigated.”Sinn Féin MLA Raymond McCartney Justice Spokesman welcomed the Coroners Court decision and said: “The Bradley family have been campaigning for the truth about what happened to Seamus for many years. All families bereaved by the conflict are entitled to access to the truth about the deaths of their loved ones.“We need to see the British Government implementing the legacy mechanisms agreed at Stormont House so that families and campaigners can get access to the truth.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshCAPTION: -year-old IRA volunteer Seamus Bradley."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland society dealt decade anniversaries commemorations","story":"This week’s th anniversary commemoration of the Battle of the Bogside comes in the midst of a decade of anniversaries of many of the seminal events in recent Irish history. Half-a-century on, this week has also seen contention and disturbances surrounding the Apprentice Boys of Derry annual parade in Derry-the very same demonstration that was the focal point for the beginning of serious violence exactly  years ago.But, whilst the events of August  in Derry without doubt played a pivotal role in shaping the following decades, in a wider context it was just one episode amongst many more fraught historical events of the last  years.The decade between - was undoubtedly one of the most consistently eventful in Ireland throughout the twentieth century.Within those ten years the country went through the campaign for Home Rule, World War One, the Easter Rising, the Irish War of Independence, partition, the Irish Civil War and the foundation of the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. Added to that were campaigns for social change exemplied by the  Lockout and the suffrage movement.In combined effect, each of these hugely momentous events left no strata of Irish society untouched or unscathed by the violence that emanated from them. And, the historical shockwaves of some of these events, most particularly partition, also shaped future events in Northern Ireland that literally exploded onto the streets in the late s.In the Republic of Ireland concerted efforts have been made in recent years to make this decade of centenaries more inclusive and tolerant and respectful. The civic remembrance of those Irish men who fought and died on the British side in WWI has grown for example and the previously unthinkable visit to Dublin by an English monarch has taken place.Republican leaders once sworn to end Queen Elizabeth II’s reign in Northern Ireland by any means necessary have greeted her with handshakes and smiles. Uncomfortable conversations around these events have also taken place.In the North, still three years away from the conclusion of this decade of th anniversaries, there is the looming prospect of how the creation of Northern Ireland will be dealt with by nationalists and republicans.The outward signs at least are of course currently not good, encapsulated as they are by the ongoing absence of Stormont. Overlapping it all is the fact that in the North the events of  years ago are beginning to come full circle into the realm of major time passed milestones.So, half-a-century after the Civil Rights movement rocked the foundations of the Northern state to their core, how have we dealt to date with the commemoration of seminal historical events north of the border Professor Peter Shirlow is Director at the Institute of Irish Studies at University of Liverpool and was formerly Deputy Director of the Institute of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice at Queen’s University. He has undertaken conflict transformation work in Northern Ireland and has used his knowledge to work with former combatants and non-governmental organisations in Yugoslavia, Moldova, Bahrain and Iraq.“I think we have dealt with these issues in ways that have shown a lot of maturity, especially when it came to commemorating .“There was a lot of stretching beyond previously comfortable positions and remembering for example the children and the Royal Irish Constabulary who were killed and a realisation that conflict is just not about the commemoration of those who were on ‘your’ side. We are also beginning to look at women in this period who were made invisible.“There are many ways in which to understand what happened and they are a lot more erse than we have been told, but we haven’t yet built this into ways of how to deal with our past,” Peter Shirlow said.The insistence within each community that their version of the stories of the past are the ‘righteous’ versions has been at the root of inter-communal stre even decades after actual conflict has ceased. Heroic versions of the past are something that Peter Shirlow says that as a society we need to look beyond. He added that his research has indicated that Northern Ireland’s dferent cultures are not necessarily converging on that issue as yet.Professor Shirlow is also the Independent Chair of the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister Employers’ Guidance on Recruiting People with Conflict Related Convictions working Group.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHe told the Derry News: “I have found a very strong sense in the Protestant Unionist Loyalistcommunity that the conflict is finished and there’s a need to move on. They don’t want to engage because there’s a sense it’s in the past, that it’s over.“More people in the PUL community seem to have drawn a line under it-that it was  years ago, so there’s a reluctance to engage. A lot of loyalist prisoners came out and went back to work and don’t appear to have the same fascination with the Troubles.“The republican view of that is they believe loyalists do not want to engage because they are ashamed. It’s not a practical or a sensible view.“I’ve done a lot of research within Protestant working-class communities and there’s some acknowledgement of history, some reverence for Edward Carson and a degree of asking where we are going, but not a lot of interest in looking back at what happened during the Troubles.”The academic also said that he senses with the nationalist and republican community a need that their narrative of events “must be proven right.”So, the Derry News asked Peter Shirlow about how things will pan out when the centenary of the creation of Northern Ireland arrives It’s an issue he believes which still very much reverberates within the political sphere today.“The issue of partition is part of the inter-party talks at the minute. We will have to decide whether Northern Ireland is a ‘good place’ or a ‘bad place’.“We tend not to concentrate on what we have done well. Culturally we are globally renowned-from Van Morrison right through to Snow Patrol’s Crashing Cars being the most listened to song of the st century so far. In terms of sport we recently hosted The Open and we have names such as Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, but we don’t use what should symbolise the positive aspects but concentrate on the fractious issue of conflict. It makes us forget how globally regarded we are,” he said.Professor Shirlow also contends that the all invasive aspects of one-sided commemoration also often obscure the stories of human bravery and kindness that took place during the conflict.“There are stories of the Troubles where many people put their own lives in danger to save others. I know someone in Ardoyne who took a policeman into their home and him to stop him being killed. It stops the appreciation of victims being someone’s mother or father, son or daughter. And, I’m sure it’s the same in Derry.“Commemoration doesn’t look at a lot of le experiences or the fact that people on both sides took risks to help protect each other. Commemoration can largely be about the self.”The Derry News also asked Peter Shirlowhe thinks that at specic times, political parties push their ideas of commemoration onto their prospective voters to purposefully polarise communities “There is part of it that is a response to ‘your’ community and that symbolises that these events have power and politicians are sometimes trapped in that. But, of course parties will use that for their own ends.“If we united on issues like the health service, education, employment and the environment perhaps there wouldn’t be such a focus on identity. However, there are signs that people are exploring other ways to move forward,” he said.CAPTION: Professor Peter Shirlow, Director of the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool."},{"url":null,"title":"special creggan performance dedicated lyra mckee","story":"A special all-female performance of a play written by esteemed Irish dramatist Brian Friel took place in Creggan yesterday in memory of Lyra McKee.Art Over Borders’ th Lughnasa FrielFest paid tribute to the young writer and journalist who was killed in the city with a free performance of Brian Friel’s  play The Enemy Within.Two performances had been scheduled to take place in two churches, St. Columba’s Church of Ireland in Omagh, Friel’s birthplace, and All Saints Church of Ireland in the Waterside Derry on Saturday.However, festival organiser Arts Over Borders unexpectedly announced the additional free performance in Creggan.The Enemy Within is centred around Columbas room or cell in the Autumn of , on the island of Iona, off the West coast of Scotland.The entire play centres around issues such as ‘Who am I’ and ‘To whom am I connected ’Published in , Friel wrote the play connecting it to the social troubles at the time.Columbas enemies were not only limited to his inner self, but also to his own family. Even though he had left Ireland, presumably for good, his family held an immovable grip which crippled Columba in his work on Iona.This pressure contributes to the inner struggles Columba is forced through in several parts of the play.Yesterdays performance on the last day of the four-week festival was dedicated to the memory of Lyra McKee who was shot dead during rioting in the Creggan area on April  of this year.Her partner Sara Canning was invited along by the organisers. Derry born festival co-curators Sean Doran and Liam Browne felt it was appropriate and timely to honour the memory of Lyra McKee with this all-female world premiere presentation.Speaking to the Derry News, Mr Doran said: “Our international Brian Friel Festival is jointly held in Donegal and Derry, with the Derry location now celebrating the playwright’s more socio-political plays and themes of justice, gender and ethnicity.“To complement the Lughnasa FrielFest Donegal, Here I Come! we have given the title of OVERCOME to Derry’s Lughnasa FrielFest in recognition of Derry’s ability to continually overcome its challenges and to resonate  years on from the Civil Rights marches of  that were directly inspired by the Black American Civil Rights movement.“The Black spiritual singers Ruby Philogene MBE and Tayo Aluko will join the casts of Brian Friel’s The Enemy Within and The Freedom of the City offering sung preludes and interludes to the Omagh and Derry performances.”Mr Browne added: “We had the pleasure of working with Lyra previously when she kindly agreed to be part of a discussion  in our Home of St. Patrick Festival in Armagh in . On that occasion she explored the particular challenges that face young women today, the pressures to reveal, issues around identity, privacy and such.“The subjects which Friel explored throughout his work of gender, poverty, ethnicity, isolation and spirituality mirror the themes which also concerned Lyra and about which she wrote.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"strength community shown newtown mayoral visits","story":"Newtown Mayor Cllr David Selby with members of the Men#s Shed\" Strength of community shown in mayoral visitsThe fire cadets in Newtown.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"a level result celebrations ysgol bro hyddgen machynlleth","story":"With their A-level results at Ysgol Bro Hyddgen are, from left, Owen Kimpton , Seren Fabltspan classtruncate-full-screengter , Harriet Bletcherand Lewys Meredydd lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Pictures: A-level celebrations at Ysgol Bro HyddgenAur Bleddyn with her A-level resultsat Ysgol Bro Hyddgen, Machynllltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgteth.lt spangtlt spangt\" Pictures: A-level celebrations at Ysgol Bro HyddgenPicking up their A-level results at Ysgol Bro Hyddgen, Machynlleth, are from lefltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtt: Aeryn Carpenter ,Celt John , Macsen Tomos , Stefan Jones .lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Pictures: A-level celebrations at Ysgol Bro HyddgenPicking up their A-level results at Ysgol Bro Hyddgen, Machynlleth, are from lefltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtt Tomos Chickand Rose Williamson lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"outstanding welsh bacc a level tally caereinion high school","story":"Caereinion High School A-Level results..Pictured left to right, Laura SchjoettFltspan classtruncate-full-screengtrances AndrewHarry Woodhouseand Ezri Alkilani-Brown .Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Pictures: Outstanding Welsh Bacc and A-level tally at Caereinion High SchoolCaereinion High School A-Level results..Pictured is Head Girl, Aggie Titley .Picture byltspan classtruncate-full-screengt Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"39 excellent 39 a level results praised llanfyllin","story":"Llanfyllin High School A-Level results..Pictured is Head Boy, Iolo Jones.Picture by Pltspan classtruncate-full-screengthil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Pictures: #Excellent# A-level results praised at Llanfyllin High SchoolLlanfyllin High School A-Level results..Pictured left to right, Head Boy, Iolo Jltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtonesLltspan classtruncate-full-screengteah Jacksand Arran Evison .Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Pictures: #Excellent# A-level results praised at Llanfyllin High SchoolLlanfyllin High School A-Level results..Pictured is Head Boy, Iolo Jones.Picture by Pltspan classtruncate-full-screengthil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Pictures: #Excellent# A-level results praised at Llanfyllin High SchoolLlanfyllin High School A-Level results..Pictured left to right, Rhydian Moreton ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtand David Caan-Woollltspan classtruncate-full-screengtey celebrating their results..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Pictures: #Excellent# A-level results praised at Llanfyllin High SchoolLlanfyllin High School A-Level results..Pictured is Tilly Thornton celebrating hltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgter A and B..Picture ltspan classtruncate-full-screengtby Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"pictures strong year a level successes welshpool high school","story":"Celebrating A-level results at Welshpool High School are Maisie Inns, left,and Jennltspan classtruncate-full-screengta Foulkes .

He brushed aside two weak challenges in the YC box before firing past Carberry.Within less than a minute it was -.A superb run and cross from Rice was laid off by Neale to the onrushing Thomas Healy and he steered the ball into the corner of Walshrsquos net for his first goal for Killyleagh.Killyleagh were struggling to deal with Olympicrsquos pace in attack, with Molloy in particular causing problems and it took a fine save from Carberry in the th minute to keep out the wingerrsquos curling shot.From the resultant corner Olympicrsquos two big central defenders combined, with Paul Dickson outjumping Macaulay Foster to head back for Jason Noade to head in and make it -.The second half was only four minutes old when Olympic had strong penalty appeals waved away by the referee when McClean went down in the box under a challenge from McConnell.Two goals inside two minutes shortly after the hour mark seemed to have killed the game.Nathan Jones was having his best ever game at The Showgrounds with Killyleagh struggling to cope with his pace when he switched to the left wing in the second half.When he was left one on one with YC sweeper Niall Walsh in the st minute he put on the after burners and delivered a beauty of a finish past Carberry.Ballynahinchrsquos fourth goal, two minutes later, was stunning. A superb team goal passing across the fullof the pitch, orchestrated by Stephen Noade and involving Jones, ended in a YC defender putting into his own net.Killyleagh, though, refused to throw the towel in and when their stand-out player, Rice, yet again exposed a vulnerability on the flanks, his inch-perfect cross was bravely turned in by Neale in the th minute.This was the spark for Killyleaghrsquos best spell of the game with Rice giving width and McConnell the creator and Jamie Sharvin linking up play.Walsh somehow kept out with his feet Jamie Sharvinrsquos nd minute effort from Healyrsquos pass and then three minutes later he gratefully ped on Jamie Sharvinrsquos close range shot under pressure from another Rice cross.The big crowd was getting value for the entrance fee now and Walsh underlined his Amateur League representative reputation by producing a supering save from Ricersquos cross to cut out the danger in the th minute.Olympic were content to hit on the break by this stage and substitute Aaron McClean went close with a header before the visitors delivered the ultimate sucker punch.A stunning pass from deep allowed Jones to race through and Dalton Tate delivered the finish in the nd minute.But still the game wasnrsquot finished. Rice powered down the line yet again and once more producing a teasing cross which Neale thumped in.It was now -.

By working with the Downpatrick Property Trust, we are able to regenerate this building to provide a commercial interest and much needed guest accommodation in the heart of the town.Breenrsquos Corner is the third project to be undertaken by the trust.It previously developed and later sold Maghinis House in Irish Street and also developed Britches Close in English Street as commercial and office accommodation.The trust also invested pound, in the Breenrsquos Corner buildings when they were bought and refurbished as residential accommodation in .The last of the residential tenants vacated the building several months ago and it has remained unoccupied.Current commercial clients which occupy ground-floor shops are not included in the development.The trust, which is chaired by Fergus Kelly, was described treasurer Mal McGrady as ldquoa community developer of the last resort which gets engaged when there is no private interest in developing a building or the cost of renovation would make development prohibitive for any private investor.He said: ldquoWe are excited by the new concept that Stephen Magorrian and Denvirrsquos proposed to us.ldquoThis concept is a win-win both for Denvirrsquos as it gives extra accommodation while bringing back this property into use which is beneficial to the townrsquos tourism offering.Mr McGrady said that the project was important to Downpatrick town centrersquos continued development.ldquoAt present this buildingrsquos external facade is an eyesore, particularly for traffic entering the town centre.ldquoWe will have the facility to provide an extra  beds in the town centre which will help provide accommodation for people on golf tours, bike tours, casual visitors and bus tours who stop at the St Patrickrsquos Centre and Down Museum and we believe that this will help regenerate the town centre, he added.The development, which is designed by JNP Architects and is being carried out by Keelryan Developments Ltd, of Newcastle, intends to provide affordable, contemporary guest accommodation to appeal to tourists and visitors who wish to stay in the town.Mr Magorrian said the Horatio Group would be responsible for the interior fit-out of the rooms and suites which would be leased from DPT and marketed by Denvirrsquos on its website and other hospitality sites such as Air bnb.ldquoI want the guests to be totally surprised when they come into the accommodation as it will be totally dferent to the exterior, he remarked.ldquoGuests can either walk the few metres around the corner to breakfast at the inn or enjoy a breakfast hamper provided by Denvirrsquos made up with items from local suppliers..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17822015.plenty-see-year-39-s-fermanagh-county-show/resources/images/9653973.jpg","title":"bandstand john garrity","story":"How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band How would you describe your sound Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We learn about the Romans, World War Two, the American Civil War at school, but most people have never been taught about the history of their own country.ldquoWe have more castles than any other country in the world per square mile, and thatrsquos something worth celebrating.Fonmon Castle is a rarity among Welsh castles, uniquely well-suited to creating interactive events like jousting, workshops, Renaissance and Steampunk fairs, and many more.ldquoFonmon Castle is one of the few Welsh castles that is still lived in, explained Mr OrsquoHenessey. ldquoIt has remained within two families since it was built by the Marcher Lords during the Norman invasion.ldquoIt recently it was sold to a very friendly couple and they headhunted me in order to help them turn the castle around, to open it up to the public and help teach people more about Welsh history.ldquoTheyrsquove basically provided me a blank cheque.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

prevent dogs dying in hot cars this summer and to raise awareness on summer safety for our canine friends.Just a few minutes in a hot car can prove fatal for dogs and yet every year animal welfare charities and the police receive thousands of reports of animals being left alone in cars on warm days.That’s why together with Dogs Trust, Councils across Northern Ireland are running ‘Summer Fun for Cool Canines’ events as part of the Dogs Die in Hot Cars campaign, to raise awareness about the dangers of leaving dogs in hot cars and to provide dog owners with practical tips to keep their dog cool and safe this summer.Laura McAnea, Campaigns Manager at Dogs Trust, said: “Many people still believe that it’s OK to leave a dog in a car on a warm daythe windows are left open or they’re parked in the shade, but the truth is, it’s not.“A car can become as hot as an oven very quickly, even when it doesn’t feel that warm and a dog can die in a hot car in  minutes. When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise.

Editor John Mulgrew looks at the numbers, the analysis and the once household names no longer with us The tattered corner of the Ulster Business Top  list from  probably isn’t the worst way to analogise the then state of the Northern Ireland economy, and a precursor to what was around the cornerWe’ve come a very long way in a decade, and while there are some big and familiar names on the  Top  list, there are firms which have fallen off it entirely, and resigned to the history books post-recession.In former editor David Elliott’s intro to the magazine, it references the fact that most of the accounting periods in the list were just as the downturn was starting to gather pace.Economist John Simpson, writing in the edition, says the “big recession of  and  did not impact evenly across the economy, and recovery will be best seen as a sequence of dferent proportions”.There are some positive things to take from it – including a large glowing image of Victoria Square, which in the more than  years since it opened in the heart of Belfast has become part of the retail fabric of the city.Topping the list at the time was Viridian Group, which owned Northern Ireland Electricity and now includes Power NI as a subsidiary, with turnover of £.bn. However, it made a loss of £m during that period.Second on the list is a business familiar to many. Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute.

For the UK, it is a signicantly big company.“Looking year-over-year, our performance was very consistent in the last few years.”“For people working there, working for a company which is the largest employer in a country, the top company, it is a source of pride for us.“But I don’t think that drives the behaviour of the team. We are more interested in making sure that our performance is sustainable in terms of margins.“It is nice that we arebut that is not our main goal. We are making sure that we are sustainable, work on quality, safety. There are lots of other things. It’s making sure that we fit our customer needs.“We have a lot focus on that, and we need to be competitive.”And as for growth, expanding turnover isn’t necessarily the main focus, according to Flavio“A lot of the efforts in the last year have been to consolidate the management tools they have in Pilgrim’s. They are very keen on efficiency, so that’s one of their strategies. “ a lot of focus in improving our performance, it’s how we can be more efficient, focusing on a portfolio that feeds our customer base, how we deal with our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ulster business top  launch ","story":"Posted on Wednesday  August  by Ulster Business Sarah Little, publishing director, INM NI, Mark Thompson, AL Goodbody with John Mulgrew The cream of Northern Ireland’s business community have gathered to mark the official launch of the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies , with AL Goodbody.
